THEORETICAL STUDIES OF MACROMOLECULES We present novel theoretical approaches to studies of macromolecular conformation.  There are four areas of current effort.  1) Enhancement and application of distance geometry to noncrystalline structures.  2) Use of molecular surface ideas to find and characterize binding sites and to develop docking algorithms.  3) Application of the Diffusion-Collision model for protein folding kinetics to proteins containing beta structure. 4) Prediction of secondary structure in proteins using pattern recognition techniques.  Preliminary results are described for each area.  ,THEORETICAL STUDIES OF MACROMOLECULES,3279536,R01GM031497,"['nucleic acid structure ', ' macromolecule ', ' mathematical model ', ' computer simulation ', ' artificial intelligence ', ' conformation ', ' ']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,1985,84599,0.10920768207565279
"MEDIATORS OF INSULIN-DEPENDENT MESSENGER RNA SYNTHESIS Insulin prevents the induction of mRNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by dubutyryl cyclic AMP and hydrocortisone in Reuber hepatoma cells but simultaneously acts in an additive fashion with these agents in inducing tyrosine aminotransferase.  These results imply that these agents interact to promote or inhibit mRNA production from specific genes. Therefore, this project will test the idea that insulin, cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids alter production of specific messenger RNAs in Reuber hepatoma cells by altering the charge, abundance or intracellular distribution of genetic regulatory proteins.  Two model proteins that translocate to the nucleus and are probably involved in transcriptional regulation (the glucocorticoid receptor and type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase) will be identified in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels (2D-PAGE) of radiolabeled extracts of whole cells, nuclei and chromatin. These proteins will be studied to find whether hormonal combinations that alter mRNA induction alter their activation or translocation to the nucleus.  Activation will be sought as changes in the charge (phosphorylation state or other modification) of these receptors using 2D-PAGE.  Translocation will be detected as decreased association of these proteins with the cytosol and increased association with the nucleus after hormonal stimulation, again identifying the receptors with 2D-PAGE.  Cells will be treated with insulin to identify molecules whose charge or abundance is regulated by this hormone, and a molecule will be sought that becomes associated with chromatin after insulin treatment.  Nuclear events such as translocation of regulatory molecules or altered phosphorylation of histones and other proteins will be identified and attempts will be made to correlate these events with altered production of messenger RNAs.  Events that correlate with insulin's ability to abolish the induction of messenger RNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by dibutyryl cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids, will be pursued.  If a putative regulator is found, I will attempt to purify it, study how it is activated, and determine how it associates with chromatin or DNA.  Knowledge of how protein effectors are stimulated by insulin to regulate genetic events is fundamental to the understanding of long-term changes brought about by insulin, and conversely, of changes expected in the course of diabetes.

"MOLECULAR BIOLOGY COMPUTER RESOURCE AND RESEARCH PROGRAM The project is a molecular biology computer Resource for the Northeastern United States, coupled with a Research program on computer pattern recognition in molecular genetics.  The Research has two main objectives. One is to develop statistical and computer methods that can reveal syntactic and semantic patterns in DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, most of which are still obscure or unknown.  The other is to use such pattern analysis tools - those developed in the course of the project and others that are deemed appropriate - to discover sequences that trace evolution and that regulate the expression of important genes and gene families.  The identification of such sequences should provoke the formulation and testing of major hypotheses in molecular evolution, gene regulation and developmental genetics.  The molecular biology computer Resource provides these DNA, RNA, and protein sequence analysis tools - and all others that are demonstrably valid and useful and freely available - to investigators within this region on-line, and to the larger research community on magnetic media.  On-line access is through computers at the Resource site, and the programs distributed on tapes and floppy disks are for micro, supermicro, mini, and mainframe computers running under UNIX and other operating systems.  The resource trains molecular biologists in statistics and computer methods, and educates biomathematicians and computer scientists in contemporary molecular genetics.

"NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE ANALYSIS We have developed a method to clone synthetic DNAs with regions of random sequence.  We are using this technique to create millions of ribosome binding sites in an isogenic background.  The cloning vehicle contains the lacZ gene positioned to allow quantitation of initiation from each binding site and the f1 origin which allows rapid DNA sequencing.  From a large set of sequences for which we know the relative efficiencies of initiation we can build linear models of the E. coli ribosome binding site.  We will construct plasmids with regions that differ on the 5' and 3' sides from our original plasmid in order to study the more complex effects of mRNA structure and context on translational initiation.  We propose to extend this technique into a tool for the study of any binding site.  We are also studying sequence specific recognition of DNA by proteins.  We have adapted the Shannon measure of information to quantitate the information content of several recognition systems.  This has led to a prediction that the T7 late promoters have overlapping repressor sites, a prediction that we are now testing.

"MULTIMODALITY CARDIAC IMAGE UNDERSTANDING An image understanding system is proposed to analyze cardiac dysfunction found by combining information from multiple, noninvasive imaging modality studies.  The system is a model for intelligent multimodality image understanding in general, but is applied to a very specific problem:  detection and rating of left ventricular (LV) aneurysms.  Key features of the system are:  1) its ability to handle and quantify uncertain or partial image- derived information in a concise way using probabilistic evidential reasoning, 2) its ability to fuse pertinent relative information from independent diagnostic images of the same patient to achieve an algorithm-assembled, consensus, quantitative opinion of cardiac shape and motion, and finally 3) to arrive at a decision- level set of numbers that quantify and localize left ventricular aneurysm formation for each patient.  The availability of data such as described in 3) will enable more precise prognostic or diagnostic risk classification for patients, making therapy alternatives more rational.  Because of the subjective probabilistic reasoning strategy (based on the principle of maximum entropy) the final quantitative results will carry not only the system's assessment of a particular patients' heart, but also the degree of confidence that the automated analysis system has in the result it presents.  This confidence is increased when similar LV motion and shape is perceived by the multiple imaging modalities.  The proposed system design is influenced by current artificial intelligence and image understanding technologies, but remains firmly grounded in more classical mathematical and statistical methodology.  The system will be initially tested using radionuclide angiographic (RNA) and two-dimensional echocardiographic (2DE) semi- quantified (manual tracing of LV borders) and then fully quantified (by the system's own border-finding algorithm) studies and compared with qualitative readings, quantified contrast ventriculograms, and then with surgeon's and pathologist's measurements and reports.  Preliminary studies show that 1) RNA left lateral view qualitative studies correlate well with pathology, 2) that complementary 2DE views help resolve RNA problems with finding the anterior LV wall and 3) quantification of LV motion and shape better defines the spectrum between normal and grossly abnormal.

"MULTIMODALITY CARDIAC IMAGE UNDERSTANDING An image understanding system is proposed to analyze cardiac dysfunction found by combining information from multiple, noninvasive imaging modality studies.  The system is a model for intelligent multimodality image understanding in general, but is applied to a very specific problem:  detection and rating of left ventricular (LV) aneurysms.  Key features of the system are:  1) its ability to handle and quantify uncertain or partial image- derived information in a concise way using probabilistic evidential reasoning, 2) its ability to fuse pertinent relative information from independent diagnostic images of the same patient to achieve an algorithm-assembled, consensus, quantitative opinion of cardiac shape and motion, and finally 3) to arrive at a decision- level set of numbers that quantify and localize left ventricular aneurysm formation for each patient.  The availability of data such as described in 3) will enable more precise prognostic or diagnostic risk classification for patients, making therapy alternatives more rational.  Because of the subjective probabilistic reasoning strategy (based on the principle of maximum entropy) the final quantitative results will carry not only the system's assessment of a particular patients' heart, but also the degree of confidence that the automated analysis system has in the result it presents.  This confidence is increased when similar LV motion and shape is perceived by the multiple imaging modalities.  The proposed system design is influenced by current artificial intelligence and image understanding technologies, but remains firmly grounded in more classical mathematical and statistical methodology.  The system will be initially tested using radionuclide angiographic (RNA) and two-dimensional echocardiographic (2DE) semi- quantified (manual tracing of LV borders) and then fully quantified (by the system's own border-finding algorithm) studies and compared with qualitative readings, quantified contrast ventriculograms, and then with surgeon's and pathologist's measurements and reports.  Preliminary studies show that 1) RNA left lateral view qualitative studies correlate well with pathology, 2) that complementary 2DE views help resolve RNA problems with finding the anterior LV wall and 3) quantification of LV motion and shape better defines the spectrum between normal and grossly abnormal.  Subsequent incorporation of magnetic resonance images (which have improved LV boundary definition) into the evaluation system will test its ability to adapt to and profit from new types of data.

"CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT IN NMR One of the most important applications for 2- and higher dimensional NMR spectroscopy is the determination of accurate 3-dimensional structures of small proteins, nucleic acids, and other important biological molecules in solution.  this new application, based in large part on NOESY data, offers unique promise for structural understanding of complex biomolecular systems.

The goal of this project offers an improved methodology to meet directly the first challenge and to assist meeting the second challenge:  optimization of spectral contrast and resolution enhancement for multi-dimensional NMR data and improvement of quantification for evaluation of molecular structures.  To achieve this goal, non-linear processing methodology based on maximum likelihood spectral reconstruction is combined with selected symmetrization and other mathematical and logical operations, to enhance 2D and 3D NMR spectral contrast, and significantly facilitate identification of all crosspeaks, with subsequent improved quantification for both isolated and overlapped spectral features.  this project will evaluate and extend spectral quantification using these methods, exploring whether the methodology increases the number of usable and quantifiable crosspeaks.  Preliminary investigations suggest that gains of 25-50% or more can be achieved, significantly improving subsequent molecular modeling steps.

"COMPUTER-BASED SEQUENCE ANALYSIS AND RNA VIRUS EVOLUTION The goal of the proposed research is the analysis of biological sequence  data to address the molecular mechanisms of evolution and the origin(s)  of all viruses and related genetic elements. Phylogenetic trees will  provide a framework for the mapping of cell and tissue tropism,  pathogenicity and virulence, modes of transmission and geographical  distributions, and many other higher order characteristics of viruses.  The specific aims of proposed analytical studies are: i) determining  functionally equivalent networks and frequency of exchange among and  between retroid elements, and their potential cellular homologues,  including new studies on 300 retroviral env proteins; 2) inferring  functionally important regions of all proteins of paramyxo-, rhabdo- and  filoviruses, (with privileged access to new Ebola sequences), and Borna  Disease virus, (including potential BDV sequences from schizophrenic  patients); and 3) the analysis of the dUTPase gene, as a model system,  to address issues relevant to the structure, function and evolution of  duplicated sequences, and potential horizontal transfer among and between  host and viral genomes. The specific aims of the technical studies are:  i) evaluation of stochastic production model approaches for generation  of multiple alignments, detection of recombination, and calculation of  evolutionary distances; and 2) development and testing of new and  existing methods for historical reconstruction of functionally equivalent  networks.    RNA viruses (e.g. HIV, or Ebola) are the major causative agents of human,  animal and plant viral diseases world wide. The heterogeneous nature of  RNA populations makes it difficult to develop effective, anti-viral  agents. The sequence database is now large enough to conduct comparative  studies on natural variants versus chemotherapeutically induced mutants  for several retroviral proteins. This model study will provide new  information on the nature of selected mutations which will be useful in  future anti-viral drug development.    Computational analysis of primary sequence data is an area of intense  interest in biology, mathematics, statistics and systems science. In the  last few years new approaches to problem solving and classification, such  as machine learning, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and stochastic  production models or, ""intelligent systems"" as they are referred to  collectively, have become available.

"THEORETICAL STUDIES OF DRUG-NUCLEIC ACID INTERACTIONS The long term goal of this project is to improve computer based simulation  methods that can be applied to study the structures, kinetics and  thermodynamics of nucleic acids and their interaction with ligands.  In the  next period of grant support, we anticipate making major improvements in  the energy function used to describe nucleic acids, and in the methodology  to determine conformational free energies, free energies for mutations, and  absolute free energies of association for nucleic acids and nucleic  acid-ligand complexes using molecular dynamics/free energy approaches.  We  plan to use available X-ray and NMR data to evaluate our models.  Applications to a number of the most interesting physical chemical  phenomena in DNA and RNA structure and thermodynamics will be carried out  including the Z phobicity of AT base pairs, the thermodynamics of RNA  loops, the sequence selectivity and binding of DNA minor groove binding  ligands, and the neighbor exclusion rule for ligand binding to DNA.    Recent advances are allowing a most exciting synergy between computer based  theoretical methods to study intermolecular inter-actions and experiments.  These computer simulations are yielding more accurate insights than ever  before and are often correctly predicting the results of subsequent  experiments. The work proposed here has such a synergistic relationship to  experiments and is aimed at a continued improvement of the predictive power  of these computer based theoretical methods. The long term objective of our  studies is to make the computer based approaches truly reliable and  predictive and to use them in anti-cancer and anti-AIDS drug design.

"RNA STRUCTURE DETERMINATION WITH COMPARATIVE METHODS The ability to elucidate RNA structure has broad significance in the study  of RNA.  Comparative sequence analysis is one method, complementary to  experimental procedures, that has yielded important RNA structural  information.    The sequencing revolution is helping to create larger comparative sequence  databases, which in turn creates an opportunity to decipher more RNA  structural information.  Computationally intensive methods are required to  find this information.    The purpose of this project, is to develop and refine our correlation  analysis, and apply these analysis tools to the question of RNA structure  determination.  Initial studies are very encouraging, suggesting that  continued efforts will result in new structural findings.    The results of this analysis have widespread applications, including but no  limited to antisense research, overall structural considerations of  ribosomal RNAs, and other important RNA molecules, and general RNA structur  prediction.

"DNA PATTERN IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS We will continue our development of methods for recognizing and                  representing functional domains in biological sequences.  This                   includes methods to identify regulatory sites in DNA starting                    from unaligned sequences, and to develop models that will allow                  new sites to be accurately predicted.  This will involve the                     adoption of better statistical models so that the most                           significant alignments can be more readily obtained.  We will                    also develop improved methods for recognizing functional motifs                  in RNA sequences that are composed of both sequence and                          structure.  These methods will be useful for identifying                         regulatory domains that operate post-transcriptionally, and also                 for determining the common motifs in RNAs selected in vitro for                  particular activities.  And we will further enhance methods for                  representing conserved domains in protein families that new                      members of the families can be identified more reliably.  This                   will involve the use of neural network methods that optimize the                 discrimination of protein family members from other sequences in                 the database that are not members of the family.

"DNA PATTERN IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS We will continue our development of methods for recognizing and                  representing functional domains in biological sequences.  This                   includes methods to identify regulatory sites in DNA starting                    from unaligned sequences, and to develop models that will allow                  new sites to be accurately predicted.  This will involve the                     adoption of better statistical models so that the most                           significant alignments can be more readily obtained.  We will                    also develop improved methods for recognizing functional motifs                  in RNA sequences that are composed of both sequence and                          structure.  These methods will be useful for identifying                         regulatory domains that operate post-transcriptionally, and also                 for determining the common motifs in RNAs selected in vitro for                  particular activities.  And we will further enhance methods for                  representing conserved domains in protein families that new                      members of the families can be identified more reliably.  This                   will involve the use of neural network methods that optimize the                 discrimination of protein family members from other sequences in                 the database that are not members of the family.

"COMPUTER BASED SEQUENCE ANALYSIS AND RNA VIRUS EVOLUTION The goal of the proposed research is the analysis of biological sequence         data to address the molecular mechanisms of evolution and the origin(s)          of all viruses and related genetic elements.

Computational analysis of primary sequence data is an area of intense            interest in biology, mathematics, statistics and systems science. In the         last few years new approaches to problem solving and classification, such        as machine learning, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and stochastic         production models or, ""intelligent systems"" as they are referred to              collectively, have become available. Unfortunately most biologists are           unaware of these developments. Application of these methods to real data         remains unexplored. The proposed studies will go a long way in rectifying        this gap in technological utilization. These studies will continue to            define important evolutionary relationships and events, provide                  biologically informative sequence relationships for bench-marking new            software, and contribute new information relevant to the structure and           function of viral proteins suggesting new directions in laboratory               experimentation. Strategies and techniques developed for the analysis of         highly divergent genomes can also be applied to the study of the wealth          of sequence information generated under the auspices of the Human Genome         Project.

"Genomic application of suspension array technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The principle of the proposed project is the application of fluorescent microsphere based suspension array technology (SAT) to the cytometry based simultaneous detection of multi analytes. The proposal consists of four overlapping subprojects: (a) Technological development of biological microbead procedures using cells or microorganisms as substitutes for polymeric microspheres to lower the cost of SAT compared to the cost of methods using microbeads manufactured by polymer chemistry. (b) Development of a test to detect gene translocations and rearragements frequently responsible for malignant transformations. A method based on measuring bead-based hybridization of specific 5' and 3' nucleotide sequences in the vicinity of chromosomal translocation breakpoints would allow large scale screening of leukemias and various types of cancers by the measurement of 5'/3' sequence ratio. (c) Development of a DNA binding protein profiling assay providing easy, reproducible and high throughput technology to determine the expression pattern of transcription factors (TFs) binding to single stranded hexamere oligonucleotide sequences anchored to the solid phase surface of microspheres. This subproject is at the R&D level and needs to be thoroughly tested.

"Structure based prediction of protein modifications  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genomics revolution has uncovered tens of thousands of proteins, nonetheless full exploitation of organismal genome projects will not occur without innovations in proteomics and structural biology. The agencies meeting this challenge, such as the seven NIH protein structure consortia , have targeted 10,000 new protein structures to be solved by 2010. We propose to use this powerfully enabling structural dataset as the basis for a new type of bioinformatic tool which models and compares the surfaces of proteins, instead of their sequence or backbone path, by analogy to sequence comparison methods. An algorithm that searches a protein's sw-lace features for post-translational modification and binding sites will offer a large step forward. The ability to model protein binding sites will allow investigators to predict how they interact, how regulatory networks are organized, and what determines the order of metabolic pathways--each a fundamental goal of much research. Cognia is well positioned to undertake this effort as we are currently building databases and tools designed to identify drug targets and biotherapeutic candidates for use in both basic research and pharmaceutical-biotech discovery. Our use of predictive tools to analyze, organize, and synthesize the content of databases lends direction to this proposal, and its near-term focus will involve the analysis of post-translational modifications such as the ubiquitylation and SUMOylation accomplished by E3 enzymes during the cell cycle. We anticipate that algorithms developed under this proposal will have many applications, including the ability to (I) predict novel binding interactions of structurally defined proteins (ii) identify structural homologs of proteins not apparent by sequence or backbone similarity searches (iii) define an enzyme's potential substrates, (iv) define structural features of binding sites. In Phase I, we will gather the requisite data and structures and carry out a pilot definition of an E3's consensus binding site. This will provide the foundation for Phase II, where we will create a tool that will scan all known structures for consensi, predicting interactions and modifications.

"Discovery of Novel RNA Genes in Genomic DNA Sequences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   To date, post-genomic analysis has focused on identification and annotation of protein-coding genes and their products. In comparison, the identification of DNA sequences encoding functional RNA has been largely neglected. Functional RNAs can encode trans-acting molecules that interact with other RNAs or proteins, such as tRNAs, rRNAs, RNaseP RNA, small nucleolar RNAs and microRNAs; they can also function in cis as untranslated regions that regulate post-transcriptional expression of mRNAs. Recent experimental and computational studies suggest that there may be hundreds of unknown functional RNAs in prokaryotes and thousands in eukaryotes.      The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a computational approach to the identification of novel RNA genes and functional RNA elements in complete DNA genomes. Machine learning techniques will be used to recognize hallmarks of functional RNA coding sequences by comparison with sequences that do not encode RNAs. Several types of signals are useful in discriminating functional RNA including: 1) differences in global sequence composition, 2) calculated RNA secondary structure features, i.e. free energy of folding and 3) specific sequence elements common to RNA structure. These and other parameters can be rapidly tried and tested using machine learning methods. This method will be optimized for individual genomes with respect to input databases, parameterization and machine learning method and architecture. Results will be evaluated computationally by cross-validation testing, comparative genomics, and calculated secondary structure and free energy of folding. Experimental studies of RNA expression and function will be conducted in conjunction with collaborators.      Preliminary studies have demonstrated the power of this approach to predict novel functional RNAs in E. coli, other bacteria and archaea as supported by computational cross-validation and experimental confirmation. We will test and apply this approach to discover new functional RNAs in eukaryotic genomes including S. cervisiae, C. elegans, and humans. RNA prediction for these larger and more complex genomes will require the optimization of computational parameters, as well as the development of appropriate input datasets and training algorithms.      The prediction of novel functional RNAs in the human genome presents an opportunity to understand new regulatory and developmental processes. Known RNAs implicated in human disease, such as telomerase RNA (cancer, aging), XIST RNA (X-chromosome inactivation) and BIC (a proto-oncogene) underscore the importance of developing a method to identify the full complement of human RNA genes.         ",Discovery of Novel RNA Genes in Genomic DNA Sequences,6558575,R01HG002665,"['Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' biotechnology ', ' eukaryote ', ' prokaryote ', ' artificial intelligence ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', ' genetic mapping ', ' genetic library ', ' mathematical model ', ' computer assisted sequence analysis ', ' RNA ', ' nucleic acid structure ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Archaea ', ' technology /technique development ', ' human genetic material tag ', ' animal genetic material tag ', ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection ', ' molecular biology information system ', ' functional /structural genomics ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2003,377162,0.18436714829816897

The work will further involve extending our own approaches to relative free energy calculations through dynamic importance sampling, analysis of non-equilibrium work events, extrapolations from histogram analysis and intelligent stepping algorithms along the alchemical reaction coordinate.

"Discovery of Novel RNA Genes in Genomic DNA Sequences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   To date, post-genomic analysis has focused on identification and annotation of protein-coding genes and their products. In comparison, the identification of DNA sequences encoding functional RNA has been largely neglected. Functional RNAs can encode trans-acting molecules that interact with other RNAs or proteins, such as tRNAs, rRNAs, RNaseP RNA, small nucleolar RNAs and microRNAs; they can also function in cis as untranslated regions that regulate post-transcriptional expression of mRNAs. Recent experimental and computational studies suggest that there may be hundreds of unknown functional RNAs in prokaryotes and thousands in eukaryotes.      The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a computational approach to the identification of novel RNA genes and functional RNA elements in complete DNA genomes. Machine learning techniques will be used to recognize hallmarks of functional RNA coding sequences by comparison with sequences that do not encode RNAs. Several types of signals are useful in discriminating functional RNA including: 1) differences in global sequence composition, 2) calculated RNA secondary structure features, i.e. free energy of folding and 3) specific sequence elements common to RNA structure. These and other parameters can be rapidly tried and tested using machine learning methods. This method will be optimized for individual genomes with respect to input databases, parameterization and machine learning method and architecture. Results will be evaluated computationally by cross-validation testing, comparative genomics, and calculated secondary structure and free energy of folding. Experimental studies of RNA expression and function will be conducted in conjunction with collaborators.      Preliminary studies have demonstrated the power of this approach to predict novel functional RNAs in E. coli, other bacteria and archaea as supported by computational cross-validation and experimental confirmation. We will test and apply this approach to discover new functional RNAs in eukaryotic genomes including S. cervisiae, C. elegans, and humans. RNA prediction for these larger and more complex genomes will require the optimization of computational parameters, as well as the development of appropriate input datasets and training algorithms.      The prediction of novel functional RNAs in the human genome presents an opportunity to understand new regulatory and developmental processes. Known RNAs implicated in human disease, such as telomerase RNA (cancer, aging), XIST RNA (X-chromosome inactivation) and BIC (a proto-oncogene) underscore the importance of developing a method to identify the full complement of human RNA genes.         ",Discovery of Novel RNA Genes in Genomic DNA Sequences,6891680,R01HG002665,"['Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' Escherichia coli ', ' biotechnology ', ' eukaryote ', ' prokaryote ', ' artificial intelligence ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', ' genetic mapping ', ' genetic library ', ' mathematical model ', ' computer assisted sequence analysis ', ' RNA ', ' nucleic acid structure ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Archaea ', ' technology /technique development ', ' human genetic material tag ', ' animal genetic material tag ', ' nucleic acid quantitation /detection ', ' molecular biology information system ', ' functional /structural genomics ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2005,377162,0.18436714829816897

"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases.

"Support Vector Machine modeling software for improving RNAi efficacy prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Title Support vector machines predict sequence ~ activity relationships in RNA interference: Project Summary/Abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a group of algorithms in supervised machine learning that are able to build classification or regression models on training data such that these models can be used to predict information not seen during model construction. RNA interference (RNAi) is the property of small (20 to 23 bases) RNA sequences that with the help of the RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) enable the catalytic cleavage of target RNA sequences and the knockdown of the expression level of the target gene. The steps involved in loading and associating an RNAi sequences into an active RISC are several in addition to the multi-factorial variation in biochemical activities of RNAi sequences once in an active RISC. Finding the relevant biochemical features that associate with these quantifiable measures of RNAi can allow i) better predictive models of RNAi and RNAi-like (e.g. microRNAs) activities and ii) a better understanding of the relevant biochemical properties since presumably less relevant properties should not increase the predictive abilities of models containing those properties. We have developed a novel feature mapping method, referred to as Binary Base mapping, that improves the ability of a SVM to predict RNAi activities when compared to 2 previous methods, refered to as Unit Vector and N-gram mapping. Alone, the Binary Base SVM method has greater predictive accuracy than a recently published neural network machine learning method, on the same training and testing data. Several additional mapping methods can be envisioned, including methods that incorporate RNAi thermodynamics, secondary structure or measures of entropy, and whether alone or in combination these mappings of sequence to vector space for SVM model construction lead to better predictive models or understanding of RNAi biochemistry is unknown. We are requesting funding for the specific aims of: i) testing whether the Binary Base method can be used to further dissect and identify relevant biochemical feature associated with RNAi activity, ii) analyzing what additional vector mapping methods lead to predictive models with increased accuracy or greater understanding of relevant biochemical properties, and iii) investigating the distribution of sites within and among target mRNA genes where predictive SVM models identify high versus low activity. Title Support vector machines predict sequence ~ activity relationships in RNA interference: Project Narrative: Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) have regulatory influence in human development and disease and better understanding how these molecules function involves the development of predictive models. Machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are 1 way to develop predictive models for these small RNA sequences and the incorporation of novel mapping methods in SVMs leads to model improvement. Finding and combining additional sequence mapping methods can lead to better predictive models for RNA interference activity as well as related processes such as microRNA activity, chemical modification of RNAi and RNAi stability or RNAi toxicity; further improving the understanding of how scnRNAs function and how they might be regulated.          ",Support Vector Machine modeling software for improving RNAi efficacy prediction,7157547,R43GM079132,"['biotechnology ', ' thermodynamics ', ' computer system design /evaluation ', ' computer program /software ', ' computer simulation ', ' genetic mapping ', ' molecular genetics ', ' mathematical model ', ' messenger RNA ', ' nucleic acid structure ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' method development ', ' gene targeting ', ' RNA interference ', ' ']",NIGMS,"INTEGRATED DNA TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2006,97773,0.08988635209667714

Despite the importance of the ubiquitination process, precise identification of ubiquitination (Ub) sites (i.e. acceptor lysine residues to which a ubiquitin molecule is attached) within substrates of ubiquitin ligases is still experimentally challenging. The development of computational approaches to predict Ub sites from a protein sequence provides an attractive alternative to the experimental methods. Here, we propose to develop a computational algorithm that could predict Ub sites with high precision. First, we will identify new protein Ub sites using a combination of multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPit) and mass spectrometry. Different environmental perturbations, such as heat shock, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and starvation for nutrients, will be introduced in order to increase the coverage of the ubiquitinated proteome. Second, we will use the dataset of new Ub sites to develop a ubiquitination sites predictor. A novel machine learning approach that includes co-training of two predictors having different data representations, and the usage of the unlabeled dataset to increase performance accuracy will be utilized. To our knowledge, this will be the first ubiquitination sites predictor developed to date. Finally, we will apply the predictor to the datasets of cell signaling and cancer-associated proteins to predict new ubiquitination sites and substrates among them. The prediction of intrinsic disorder (ID) will be carried out on the same datasets in order to test the hypothesis about preferential occurrence of Ub sites within ID regions. Annotated disease-related mutations will be extracted from three public databases (MutDB, SWISS-PROT and OMIM) and correlated with the predicted ubiquitination sites. The discovery of mutations in proximity to Ub sites or even those directly affecting Ub sites would lay the basis for formulating and testing biologically meaningful hypotheses about their role in cancer and other diseases. Proteins undergo a wide range of modifications that regulate their activity. One of such modification, ubiquitination, was shown to be involved in various human diseases including cancer, renal diseases (von Hippel-Lindau disease, Liddle syndrome, ischemic acute renal failure), several neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer, Parkinson, CAG- expansion disorders). The precise ubiquitination sites in proteins are difficult to detect. We propose to develop a computational approach that could identify such sites with high precision. This would help to develop better drugs that are directed either against the ubiquitinated proteins or against specific sites in these proteins.          ",Protein structural disorder and ubiquitination,7256169,R21CA113711,[''],NCI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R21,2007,188000,0.03207634503734726
"Computational discovery of cis-regulatory sequences DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall aim of this research proposal is to combine computational and functional methodologies to develop a set of algorithms with high positive predictive value for identifying and classifying candidate cis-regulatory sequences sites in the vicinity of any gene of interest. The underlying hypothesis is that functional non-coding sequences - particularly those governing a set of tissue-specific genes - will evince common features at the sequence level that can be identified computationally and modeled with sufficient precision to enable accurate de novo predictions. However, it is expected that the overall predictive value of computational approaches alone will be comparatively low. Rather, employed as a screening tool in combination with a high throughput functional validation methodology, computational approaches of even low (10-20%) predictive potential would be of enormous value, enabling rapid culling of tens of thousands of cis-regulatory sequences from the human genome.  The strategy employed will commence with development of a catalogue of functional non-coding sequences for a set of tissue- and lineage-specific human genes. This will be achieved by precise localization of DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) surrounding 100 erythroid-specific and 100 lymphoid lineage -restricted genes. Both tissues represent highly developed experimental systems, and a substantial amount of information has already come to light concerning both cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms operative within these cell types. DNaseI hypersensitivity in vivo is the sine qua non of a diverse cast of transcriptional regulatory elements including enhancers, promoters, insulators, and locus control regions. The utility of the nuclease hypersensitivity assay for identification of in vivo-functional regulatory sequences is unmatched: it is a mature, functionally-based approach validated by a vast literature and decades of highly productive studies encompassing hundreds of human and other eukaryotic genes. A comprehensive catalogue of HSs surrounding any gene would therefore be expected to encompass the majority - if not all - of its cognate transcriptional control elements active in the tissues under study.  Next, a significant data mining effort will be undertaken. This phase will involve (i) structural comparisons among identified functional elements; (ii) identification of candidate transcription factor binding sites within HS sequences using motif analysis methodologies; (iii) identification of correlations with ancillary genomic features such as transcriptional start sites, CpG islands, and certain classes of repetitive sequences; and (iv) structural comparisons between in vivo functional sequences and evolutionarily conserved sequences within the study regions. A major focus will be application of model techniques such as hidden Markov models, technology from gene prediction programs, and classifier kernel methods such as support vector machines. Based on these analyses, initial models for prospective detection of cis-regulatory regions will be developed.  Finally, these models will be tested in and out of sample for sensitivity and specificity. Positive feedback from successfully confirmed sites will be utilized to refine the information collected above, thereby enhancing the basic model. Predictive techniques will then be applied systematically to discover cis-regulatory sequences surrounding erythroid, lymphoid, and diverse other classes of human genes.  The resulting database will be of incalculable value in furthering the study of the regulation of human genes and the computational methodologies employed therein.

"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. First, we will use known 1D sequence motifs as ""seeds"" to create corresponding 3D motifs. Second, we will develop techniques for discovering entirely new motifs using cluster techniques. We will evaluate our models and resulting predictions through analysis of known structural sites, follow-up and dissemination of predictions with the structural genomics community, and large-scale evaluation on decoy and predicted structures. We will make the resulting models available on the Web for real-time structural annotation, and will distribute the software for open source development.

"Comparative genomics of protein structure and function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work aims to develop methods to identify functional sites in protein structures and to characterize protein function on a genomic scale. The approach is predicated on the Evolutionary Trace method (ET) to locate functional sites in structures. Preliminary studies enabled us to automate the basic steps towards a complete, automated functional annotation pipeline, namely, functional site analysis with ET; extraction from ET analysis of SD-templates that describe composition and conformation of key residues involved in binding or catalytic function; the search in other structures for geometric matches to these 3D-templates; and the analysis of which of those matched are most biologically relevant. We now seek to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the annotation pipeline by optimizing the definition of 3-D templates, by adding new template features to better judge whether molecular mimicry underlies functional similarity; and by developing novel strategies that use multiple templates to identify function. The result will reveal which regions of proteins are most biologically relevant, and hence logical targets for protein engineering and drug design, and it will extend to three dimensions a functional annotation strategy traditionally based on one- dimensional pattern matching in protein sequences.

"Comparative genomics of protein structure and function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work aims to develop methods to identify functional sites in protein structures and to characterize protein function on a genomic scale. The approach is predicated on the Evolutionary Trace method (ET) to locate functional sites in structures. Preliminary studies enabled us to automate the basic steps towards a complete, automated functional annotation pipeline, namely, functional site analysis with ET; extraction from ET analysis of SD-templates that describe composition and conformation of key residues involved in binding or catalytic function; the search in other structures for geometric matches to these 3D-templates; and the analysis of which of those matched are most biologically relevant. We now seek to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the annotation pipeline by optimizing the definition of 3-D templates, by adding new template features to better judge whether molecular mimicry underlies functional similarity; and by developing novel strategies that use multiple templates to identify function. The result will reveal which regions of proteins are most biologically relevant, and hence logical targets for protein engineering and drug design, and it will extend to three dimensions a functional annotation strategy traditionally based on one- dimensional pattern matching in protein sequences. In so doing, this work addresses a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in ""post-genomic biology"": linking massive and exponentially growing amounts of raw sequence and structure data to the molecular basis of biological function.           ",Comparative genomics of protein structure and function,7391818,R01GM079656,"['Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' structural genomics ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Enzymes ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Protein Region ', ' Protein Structure Initiative ', ' PSI ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' Source Code ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Au element ', ' Algorithms ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Numbers ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Pliability ', ' pliable ', ' Molecular Mimicry ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Collaborations ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' tool ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Solutions ', ' Solvents ', ' Electrostatics ', ' programs ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3-D ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' PAWR protein ', ' par-4 protein ', ' WT1-Interacting Protein ', ' Transcriptional Repressor PAR4 ', ' Prostate Apoptosis Response Protein 4 ', ' PRKC, Apoptosis, WT1, Regulator ', ' Hypothetical Protein ', ' Apoptosis Response Protein ', ' interest ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biology ', ' Performance ', ' protein structure function ', ' success ', ' heuristics ', ' Structure ', ' Catalysis ', ' Peptide Sequence Determination ', ' Protein Sequencing Molecular Biology ', ' Protein Sequencing ', ' Protein Sequence Determinations ', ' Amino Acid Sequence Determinations ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' mimetics ', ' computer studies ', ' computational studies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' comparative ', ' conformer ', ' ']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2008,281344,0.06599936132525913
"Protein structural disorder and ubiquitination    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Defects in the ubiquitin-proteasome system are implicated in the development of numerous human diseases. Some of the natural substrates for ubiquitination and degradation can induce malignant transformation if not properly removed from the cell. Despite the importance of the ubiquitination process, precise identification of ubiquitination (Ub) sites (i.e. acceptor lysine residues to which a ubiquitin molecule is attached) within substrates of ubiquitin ligases is still experimentally challenging. The development of computational approaches to predict Ub sites from a protein sequence provides an attractive alternative to the experimental methods. Here, we propose to develop a computational algorithm that could predict Ub sites with high precision. First, we will identify new protein Ub sites using a combination of multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPit) and mass spectrometry. Different environmental perturbations, such as heat shock, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and starvation for nutrients, will be introduced in order to increase the coverage of the ubiquitinated proteome. Second, we will use the dataset of new Ub sites to develop a ubiquitination sites predictor. A novel machine learning approach that includes co-training of two predictors having different data representations, and the usage of the unlabeled dataset to increase performance accuracy will be utilized. To our knowledge, this will be the first ubiquitination sites predictor developed to date. Finally, we will apply the predictor to the datasets of cell signaling and cancer-associated proteins to predict new ubiquitination sites and substrates among them. The prediction of intrinsic disorder (ID) will be carried out on the same datasets in order to test the hypothesis about preferential occurrence of Ub sites within ID regions. Annotated disease-related mutations will be extracted from three public databases (MutDB, SWISS-PROT and OMIM) and correlated with the predicted ubiquitination sites. The discovery of mutations in proximity to Ub sites or even those directly affecting Ub sites would lay the basis for formulating and testing biologically meaningful hypotheses about their role in cancer and other diseases. Proteins undergo a wide range of modifications that regulate their activity. One of such modification, ubiquitination, was shown to be involved in various human diseases including cancer, renal diseases (von Hippel-Lindau disease, Liddle syndrome, ischemic acute renal failure), several neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer, Parkinson, CAG- expansion disorders). The precise ubiquitination sites in proteins are difficult to detect. We propose to develop a computational approach that could identify such sites with high precision. This would help to develop better drugs that are directed either against the ubiquitinated proteins or against specific sites in these proteins.          ",Protein structural disorder and ubiquitination,7478711,R21CA113711,"['Structural Protein ', ' Performance ', ' Nutrient ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Peptide Sequence Determination ', ' Protein Sequencing Molecular Biology ', ' Protein Sequencing ', ' Protein Sequence Determinations ', ' Amino Acid Sequence Determinations ', ' Proteome ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cells ', ' Generations ', ' Communities ', ' Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man ', ' OMIM ', ' SwissProt ', ' Swiss Prot ', ' ubiquitin ligase ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' human disease ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Defect ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Protein Region ', ' Range ', ' Ubiquitination ', ' ubiquitin conjugation ', ' ubiquination ', ' Ubiquitinoylation ', ' Ubiquitilation ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome ', ' von Hippel-Lindau Disease ', ' Lindau Disease ', ' Hippel-Lindau Disease ', ' Hippel Lindau syndrome ', ' Familial Cerebelloretinal Angiomatosis ', ' Familial Cerebello-Retinal Angiomatosis ', ' Cerebroretinal Angiomatosis ', ' Site ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Starvation ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Ubiquitin ', ' High Mobility Protein 20 ', ' HMG-20 ', ' ATP-Dependent Proteolysis Factor 1 ', ' APF-1 ', ' Yeasts ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' multicatalytic endopeptidase complex ', ' Proteosome ', ' Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex ', ' Proteasome ', ' Prosome ', ' Multicatalytic Proteinase ', ' Macroxyproteinase ', ' Macropain ', ' 20S Proteosome ', ' 20S Proteasome ', ' 20S Core Proteasome ', ' 20S Catalytic Proteasome ', ' Training ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Acute Kidney Failure ', ' Acute Renal Insufficiency ', ' Acute Renal Failure ', ' Acute Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Numbers ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Lysine ', ' L-Lysine ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Heat-Shock Response ', ' Heat-Shock Reaction ', ' Heat Shock ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Lewy Body Parkinson Disease ', ' Idiopathic Parkinson Disease ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' ']",NCI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,168000,0.03207634503734726
"What Made Us Human?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Comparative genomics promises to shed light on those genetic changes that gave rise to the modern human species. Mounting evidence suggests that the vast majority of functional differences between the human and chimpanzee genomes are in regions that do not code for proteins. Focusing on these non-coding regions, we will investigate lineage-specific evolution in the human genome. Our approach includes developing likelihood ratio tests for identifying changes in either the rate or the pattern of nucleotide substitution in a single lineage. These novel methods will be implemented in open source software that can be used to scan an entire genome. We will apply this evolutionary analysis to multiple sequence alignments of human and other vertebrates, including several closely related species (macaque, chimpanzee, Neanderthal), allowing us to identify recent changes in the human genome. In order to concentrate on functionally relevant changes, evolutionary testing will be limited to sets of candidate regions with specific known or predicted functions (e.g. regulatory regions, RNA genes). Predicted functional regions will be identified using machine learning classification techniques. These classifiers will employ measures of sequence conservation as well as the rapidly expanding collection of experimental and bioinformatic annotations of the human genome, including results of the ENCODE Project and other functional genomic studies. After identifying those regions that were most significantly altered in the human lineage, we will use this functional information to develop testable hypotheses about the effects of the observed changes. Experimental investigations of these genomic regions will lead to new understanding of the evolution of human biology and health.       PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project will vastly expand knowledge of biologically relevant features of the human genome that are unique to our species.

"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          ",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,7445536,R01GM084448,"['insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' chromatin remodeling ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA Repair ', ' Unscheduled DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA Damage Repair ', ' Saccharomycetales ', ' Endomycetales ', ' Budding Yeast ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Defect ', ' Genetic Epistasis ', ' genetic epistases ', ' gene x gene interaction ', ' Interaction Deviation ', ' Epistatic Deviation ', ' Epistasis ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Quantitative Genetics ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analysis ', ' Modification ', ' protein function ', ' Galactose ', ' Galactopyranoside ', ' Galactopyranose ', ' D-Galactose ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Gene Deletion ', ' gene deletion mutation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Screening ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Heart ', ' Alanine ', ' L-Isomer Alanine ', ' L-Alanine ', ' Histone H3 ', ' Histones ', ' Algorithms ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Lysine ', ' L-Lysine ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mycophenolic Acid ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' RNA Polymerase II ', ' RNA Polymerase B ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase II ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' S.

"Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays. We also plan to test 100 lower ranking sites to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our algorithms. We will also develop an oligo competition assay as a new approach to increase the throughput of experimental motif analysis for the rest of the genome.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.

Experimental investigations of these genomic regions will lead to new understanding of the evolution of human biology and health.       PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project will vastly expand knowledge of biologically relevant features of the human genome that are unique to our species.

"Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays. We also plan to test 100 lower ranking sites to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our algorithms. We will also develop an oligo competition assay as a new approach to increase the throughput of experimental motif analysis for the rest of the genome. The data generated in this project will be the first systematic functional analysis of TF binding sites at base-pair resolution.              ",Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters,7684267,U01HG004561,"['Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) ', ' CHIP assay ', ' Elements ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Site ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' Oligo ', ' Antibodies ', ' Promoter Regions (Genetics) ', ' genetic promoter element ', ' Promotor Regions (Genetics) ', ' Promotor Regions ', ' Promoter Regions ', ' Reporter ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transfection ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Base Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Informatics ', ' Base Pairing ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Amino Acid Motifs ', ' Protein Motifs ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cells ', ' Measures ', ' Mutagenesis ', ' Mutagenesis Molecular Biology ', ' Genetics-Mutagenesis ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Chromatin ', ' forest ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Genomics ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Accounting ', ' Transcription Initiation Site ', ' Transcription Start Site ', ' cost ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2009,430878,0.08377653267791406
"Nuclear Receptor Networks in Human Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex disorders typically involve multiple factors and gene loci and are heavily influenced by environmental conditions. This is particularly true for metabolic diseases and diseases affecting mental health. As is often the case with such illnesses, regulators of gene expression, as well as their specific target genes can play a major role in not just the etiology but also the treatment of the disease. Some of the best characterized regulators associated with human disease are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily -- transcription factors that are regulated by the binding of ligands that are often influenced by environmental conditions. However, while a great deal is known about the mechanism by which individual nuclear receptors regulate the expression of individual target genes, what is sorely lacking is a comprehensive view of all their potential target genes in all the tissues in which they are expressed. This is true not only for metabolic organs for which the role of nuclear receptors is fairly well studied, but also the CNS where much less is known about the target genes and the functions of the nuclear receptors. Furthermore, several nuclear receptors are very effective drug targets, for both metabolic and mental disorders, making them among the most clinically relevant of all the transcription factors. Whereas recent advances in whole genome expression profiling and genome-wide location analysis (ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq) have allowed us to begin to define the complete transcriptome for some of these factors, much more remains to be done. Furthermore, these approaches can be technically challenging and costly, and hence very limiting. A complementary approach that has not been fully exploited is a computational one based on the DNA response elements that recruit the nuclear receptors to the regulatory regions of their target genes. However, in order to take full advantage of this approach, one must first have a comprehensive dataset of the binding motifs to which the receptors bind. The goals of this proposal are two-fold: 1) to comprehensively define the DNA binding specificity of a critical group of nuclear receptors using high throughput technology; and 2) to use that data to mine existing datasets in order to associate those nuclear receptors with human disease. These goals will be accomplished by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Use protein binding microarrays (PBMs) to determine the DNA binding specificity of select nuclear receptors on 10's of 1000's of unique sequences; and then use that data to develop high accuracy computational models to predict the entire set of sequences to which a given nuclear receptor binds; 2) use the PBM data and models generated in Aim 1 to computationally identify all the potential binding sites, target genes and related SNPs in the human genome for each nuclear receptor; and cross reference the results with databases linking genes and SNPs to human diseases (i.e., GAD and HapMap); 3) incorporate the results into a network of nuclear receptors and their target genes, with particular emphasis on metabolic diseases and mental health disorders. All of the binding motifs, potential target genes, related SNPs and networks will be catalogued in the on-line resource PAZAR, a public database of transcription factor and regulatory sequence annotation (http://www.pazar.info/cgi-bin/index.pl), and the NIH-funded Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas (NURSA) (http://www.nursa.org/). Many chronic human diseases that arise later in life - such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and mental disorders - are due to multiple factors, both genetic and environmental. The recent sequencing of the human genome has allowed us to identify new genes associated with these diseases at an ever increasing rate. In this study we apply the latest high throughput technology to help identify variations in the genetic sequence that might be related to those (and other) diseases by examining the regulatory regions of genes and the proteins that bind those regions. Our work will help bring us closer to an era of personalized medicine in which prevention, diagnosis and treatment are tailored to the individual patient, making them more effective and less costly.           Project Narrative Many chronic human diseases that arise later in life - such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and mental disorders - are due to multiple factors, both genetic and environmental.

"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          ",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,7629191,R01GM084448,"['histone modification ', ' chromatin remodeling ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA Repair ', ' Unscheduled DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA Damage Repair ', ' Saccharomycetales ', ' Endomycetales ', ' Budding Yeast ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Defect ', ' Genetic Epistasis ', ' genetic epistases ', ' gene x gene interaction ', ' Interaction Deviation ', ' Epistatic Deviation ', ' Epistasis ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Quantitative Genetics ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analysis ', ' Modification ', ' protein function ', ' Galactose ', ' Galactopyranoside ', ' Galactopyranose ', ' D-Galactose ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Gene Deletion ', ' gene deletion mutation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Screening ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Heart ', ' Alanine ', ' L-Isomer Alanine ', ' L-Alanine ', ' Histone H3 ', ' Histones ', ' Algorithms ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Lysine ', ' L-Lysine ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mycophenolic Acid ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' RNA Polymerase II ', ' RNA Polymerase B ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase II ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' S.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community.

"Identification and characterization of non-coding RNAs in diverse bacteria My long-term goal is to become a leading independent investigator heading a truly interdisciplinary group that integrates cutting-edge bioinformatic approaches with innovative wet-bench methodologies to better understand RNA-mediated regulation, particularly in the context of bacterial pathogenesis. In the mentored phase of this award, I created and employed a high-throughput computational program called SIPHT to identify and annotate regulatory RNAs (regRNAs) and utilized data from cDNA deep sequencing experiments to determine a comprehensive profile of the V. cholerae small transcriptome. In the independent phase of the award, I plan to improve upon these computational and experimental approaches and to extend their application to a wider variety of bacterial species. Aim I is to develop an improved version of SIPHT that automatically updates its databases to enable regRNA predictions and annotations in newly sequenced strains and to incorporate newly identified regRNAs into predictive searches. Aim II Is to use Iterative SIPHT searches and machine learning techniques to improve the reliability of regRNA predictions and annotations. The studies proposed in Aim III have two main objectives. The first is to utilize massively parallel sequencing of the M. tuberculosis, V. cholerae, and P. aeruginosa transcriptomes to identify novel regRNAs and to elucidate RNA-mediated regulatory responses to specific environmental stresses and cues. The second is to develop bioinformatic algorithms to identify novel regRNAs from within the large datasets produced by deep sequencing techniques. Finally, Aim IV is to improve upon current predictive algorithms for trans-acting small regRNAs (sRNAs) by determining a consensus motif for the binding sites of the RNA chaperone Hfq and utilizing this motif in the search for previously unknown sRNAencoding genes. The proposed studies will likely lead to the discovery and functional annotation of numerous regRNAs. Moreover, the approaches described will be useful in the study of RNA-mediated regulation in a wide variety of bacterial species. Numerous recent studies have implicated a role for regRNAs in mediating the virulence of bacterial pathogens. Thus, identifying and characterizing regRNAs In a wider variety of species, in addition to providing insights Into myriad basic biological processes, will likely lead to a better understanding of microbial pathogenesis that may ultimately aid in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.

"Comparative genomics of protein structure and function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work aims to develop methods to identify functional sites in protein structures and to characterize protein function on a genomic scale. The approach is predicated on the Evolutionary Trace method (ET) to locate functional sites in structures. Preliminary studies enabled us to automate the basic steps towards a complete, automated functional annotation pipeline, namely, functional site analysis with ET; extraction from ET analysis of SD-templates that describe composition and conformation of key residues involved in binding or catalytic function; the search in other structures for geometric matches to these 3D-templates; and the analysis of which of those matched are most biologically relevant. We now seek to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the annotation pipeline by optimizing the definition of 3-D templates, by adding new template features to better judge whether molecular mimicry underlies functional similarity; and by developing novel strategies that use multiple templates to identify function. The result will reveal which regions of proteins are most biologically relevant, and hence logical targets for protein engineering and drug design, and it will extend to three dimensions a functional annotation strategy traditionally based on one- dimensional pattern matching in protein sequences. In so doing, this work addresses a fundamental NIH roadmap problem in ""post-genomic biology"": linking massive and exponentially growing amounts of raw sequence and structure data to the molecular basis of biological function.           ",Comparative genomics of protein structure and function,7586248,R01GM079656,"['Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' structural genomics ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Enzymes ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Protein Region ', ' Protein Structure Initiative ', ' PSI ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' Source Code ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Au element ', ' Algorithms ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Molecular Mimicry ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Collaborations ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' tool ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Solutions ', ' Solvents ', ' Electrostatics ', ' programs ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3-D ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' PAWR protein ', ' par-4 protein ', ' WT1-Interacting Protein ', ' Transcriptional Repressor PAR4 ', ' Prostate Apoptosis Response Protein 4 ', ' PRKC, Apoptosis, WT1, Regulator ', ' Hypothetical Protein ', ' Apoptosis Response Protein ', ' interest ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biology ', ' Performance ', ' protein structure function ', ' success ', ' heuristics ', ' Structure ', ' Catalysis ', ' Peptide Sequence Determination ', ' Protein Sequencing Molecular Biology ', ' Protein Sequencing ', ' Protein Sequence Determinations ', ' Amino Acid Sequence Determinations ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' mimetics ', ' computer studies ', ' computational studies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' comparative ', ' conformer ', ' database structure ', ' data base structure ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' ']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2009,281344,0.06599936132525913
"Developing Proteogenomic Mapping for Human Genome Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome sequencing efforts are producing ever greater quantities of raw DNA sequence, but the annotation process for locating and determining the function of genetic elements has not kept up. While many aspects of annotation are difficult, it is particularly challenging to determine which parts of a genome sequence encode proteins, and therefore how the processes leading to protein translation are regulated. Not only are technologies for examining proteins more limited than those for studying RNA transcription, in an extensive study of transcription by the Encyclopedia of DNA elements consortium, a picture of great complexity emerged. The project uncovered many novel exons, alternative splice forms, and novel regulatory elements. These results indicate that nearly 9/10ths of human genes undergo alternative splicing, and the average gene produces approximately 6 splice variants. Rather than solidify knowledge regarding the location and function of genes, these results question whether we accurately know what constitutes a gene, and how the products encoded by genes determine the function of cells. The results particularly obfuscate determination of which transcripts are selected for translation to protein, further complicating annotation efforts. To address that gap, our project will determine which transcripts encode proteins, and how these are affected in several tissue types and disease conditions. We will use large tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data sets, mapping the analyzed protein data directly to several available human genome sequences, along with sets of predicted transcripts produced by the N-SCAN and CONTRAST gene finders, to reveal which parts of transcripts are translated into proteins, and in which types of cells this translation occurs. To accomplish this, our project has three specific aims: 1) to develop high-accuracy methods and software for mapping proteomic data from mass spec analyzed proteins directly to the genome locus encoding them; 2) to develop an analysis pipeline software system using a novel rule-based information management approach; and 3) to apply these developments for the high-throughput analysis of large proteomic data sets, identifying the transcripts that encode proteins in distinct tissue types and disease conditions, and placing the results in a publicly accessible track in the UCSC genome browser. We believe this project will yield significant knowledge about the location and timing of protein translation in cells, which will potentiate further investigation of how misregulation of the path from transcription to translation leads to human disease conditions.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Sequencing of the human genome is complete, but figuring out where genes are located, how they function, and how they cause or prevent human diseases like cancer has only just begun.

"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          ",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,7810583,R01GM084448,"['histone modification ', ' chromatin remodeling ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA Repair ', ' Unscheduled DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA Damage Repair ', ' Saccharomycetales ', ' Endomycetales ', ' Budding Yeast ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Defect ', ' Genetic Epistasis ', ' genetic epistases ', ' gene x gene interaction ', ' Interaction Deviation ', ' Epistatic Deviation ', ' Epistasis ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Quantitative Genetics ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analysis ', ' Modification ', ' protein function ', ' Galactose ', ' Galactopyranoside ', ' Galactopyranose ', ' D-Galactose ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Gene Deletion ', ' gene deletion mutation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Screening ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Heart ', ' Alanine ', ' L-Isomer Alanine ', ' L-Alanine ', ' Histone H3 ', ' Histones ', ' Algorithms ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Lysine ', ' L-Lysine ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mycophenolic Acid ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' RNA Polymerase II ', ' RNA Polymerase B ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase II ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' S.

"Identification and characterization of non-coding RNAs in diverse bacteria My long-term goal is to become a leading independent investigator heading a truly interdisciplinary group that integrates cutting-edge bioinformatic approaches with innovative wet-bench methodologies to better understand RNA-mediated regulation, particularly in the context of bacterial pathogenesis. In the mentored phase of this award, I created and employed a high-throughput computational program called SIPHT to identify and annotate regulatory RNAs (regRNAs) and utilized data from cDNA deep sequencing experiments to determine a comprehensive profile of the V. cholerae small transcriptome. In the independent phase of the award, I plan to improve upon these computational and experimental approaches and to extend their application to a wider variety of bacterial species. Aim I is to develop an improved version of SIPHT that automatically updates its databases to enable regRNA predictions and annotations in newly sequenced strains and to incorporate newly identified regRNAs into predictive searches. Aim II Is to use Iterative SIPHT searches and machine learning techniques to improve the reliability of regRNA predictions and annotations. The studies proposed in Aim III have two main objectives. The first is to utilize massively parallel sequencing of the M. tuberculosis, V. cholerae, and P. aeruginosa transcriptomes to identify novel regRNAs and to elucidate RNA-mediated regulatory responses to specific environmental stresses and cues. The second is to develop bioinformatic algorithms to identify novel regRNAs from within the large datasets produced by deep sequencing techniques. Finally, Aim IV is to improve upon current predictive algorithms for trans-acting small regRNAs (sRNAs) by determining a consensus motif for the binding sites of the RNA chaperone Hfq and utilizing this motif in the search for previously unknown sRNAencoding genes. The proposed studies will likely lead to the discovery and functional annotation of numerous regRNAs. Moreover, the approaches described will be useful in the study of RNA-mediated regulation in a wide variety of bacterial species. Numerous recent studies have implicated a role for regRNAs in mediating the virulence of bacterial pathogens. Thus, identifying and characterizing regRNAs In a wider variety of species, in addition to providing insights Into myriad basic biological processes, will likely lead to a better understanding of microbial pathogenesis that may ultimately aid in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.

"Nuclear Receptor Networks in Human Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex disorders typically involve multiple factors and gene loci and are heavily influenced by environmental conditions. This is particularly true for metabolic diseases and diseases affecting mental health. As is often the case with such illnesses, regulators of gene expression, as well as their specific target genes can play a major role in not just the etiology but also the treatment of the disease. Some of the best characterized regulators associated with human disease are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily -- transcription factors that are regulated by the binding of ligands that are often influenced by environmental conditions. However, while a great deal is known about the mechanism by which individual nuclear receptors regulate the expression of individual target genes, what is sorely lacking is a comprehensive view of all their potential target genes in all the tissues in which they are expressed. This is true not only for metabolic organs for which the role of nuclear receptors is fairly well studied, but also the CNS where much less is known about the target genes and the functions of the nuclear receptors. Furthermore, several nuclear receptors are very effective drug targets, for both metabolic and mental disorders, making them among the most clinically relevant of all the transcription factors. Whereas recent advances in whole genome expression profiling and genome-wide location analysis (ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq) have allowed us to begin to define the complete transcriptome for some of these factors, much more remains to be done. Furthermore, these approaches can be technically challenging and costly, and hence very limiting. A complementary approach that has not been fully exploited is a computational one based on the DNA response elements that recruit the nuclear receptors to the regulatory regions of their target genes. However, in order to take full advantage of this approach, one must first have a comprehensive dataset of the binding motifs to which the receptors bind. The goals of this proposal are two-fold: 1) to comprehensively define the DNA binding specificity of a critical group of nuclear receptors using high throughput technology; and 2) to use that data to mine existing datasets in order to associate those nuclear receptors with human disease. These goals will be accomplished by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Use protein binding microarrays (PBMs) to determine the DNA binding specificity of select nuclear receptors on 10's of 1000's of unique sequences; and then use that data to develop high accuracy computational models to predict the entire set of sequences to which a given nuclear receptor binds; 2) use the PBM data and models generated in Aim 1 to computationally identify all the potential binding sites, target genes and related SNPs in the human genome for each nuclear receptor; and cross reference the results with databases linking genes and SNPs to human diseases (i.e., GAD and HapMap); 3) incorporate the results into a network of nuclear receptors and their target genes, with particular emphasis on metabolic diseases and mental health disorders. All of the binding motifs, potential target genes, related SNPs and networks will be catalogued in the on-line resource PAZAR, a public database of transcription factor and regulatory sequence annotation (http://www.pazar.info/cgi-bin/index.pl), and the NIH-funded Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas (NURSA) (http://www.nursa.org/). Many chronic human diseases that arise later in life - such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and mental disorders - are due to multiple factors, both genetic and environmental. The recent sequencing of the human genome has allowed us to identify new genes associated with these diseases at an ever increasing rate. In this study we apply the latest high throughput technology to help identify variations in the genetic sequence that might be related to those (and other) diseases by examining the regulatory regions of genes and the proteins that bind those regions. Our work will help bring us closer to an era of personalized medicine in which prevention, diagnosis and treatment are tailored to the individual patient, making them more effective and less costly.           Project Narrative Many chronic human diseases that arise later in life - such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and mental disorders - are due to multiple factors, both genetic and environmental.

"What Made Us Human?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Comparative genomics promises to shed light on those genetic changes that gave rise to the modern human species. Mounting evidence suggests that the vast majority of functional differences between the human and chimpanzee genomes are in regions that do not code for proteins. Focusing on these non-coding regions, we will investigate lineage-specific evolution in the human genome. Our approach includes developing likelihood ratio tests for identifying changes in either the rate or the pattern of nucleotide substitution in a single lineage. These novel methods will be implemented in open source software that can be used to scan an entire genome. We will apply this evolutionary analysis to multiple sequence alignments of human and other vertebrates, including several closely related species (macaque, chimpanzee, Neanderthal), allowing us to identify recent changes in the human genome. In order to concentrate on functionally relevant changes, evolutionary testing will be limited to sets of candidate regions with specific known or predicted functions (e.g. regulatory regions, RNA genes). Predicted functional regions will be identified using machine learning classification techniques. These classifiers will employ measures of sequence conservation as well as the rapidly expanding collection of experimental and bioinformatic annotations of the human genome, including results of the ENCODE Project and other functional genomic studies. After identifying those regions that were most significantly altered in the human lineage, we will use this functional information to develop testable hypotheses about the effects of the observed changes. Experimental investigations of these genomic regions will lead to new understanding of the evolution of human biology and health.       PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project will vastly expand knowledge of biologically relevant features of the human genome that are unique to our species. Identification and characterization of the genetic changes leading to modern humans is of fundamental interest.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community.

"Data-Driven Approaches for Molecular Docking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are used for predicting ligand binding modes, ligand binding affinities, and for computational screening to identify new specific ligands for biological targets of pharmaceutical relevance. Current approaches are characterized by high inter-target variability and sharp limitations in ability to make accurate predictions for new ligands that are structurally different from known ones. Approaches that model protein flexibility directly or approach simulation-level detail in complex molecular systems have shown some success. However, they are generally applicable only in low throughput and in cases where high-quality experimentally determined protein target structures are available. This is in part why ""me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. Such drugs generally bring much less pharmacological novelty to patient treatment than structurally novel therapeutics. We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our recent work has established an approach to treating protein flexibility in docking that addresses large protein movements by considering multiple experimental structures and small ligand-dependent movements by protein/ligand complex relaxation beginning from many putative ligand dockings. We have also established an approach for de novo protein pocket induction that constructs a binding site based solely on ligand binding data that is capable of making accurate predictions of binding geometry and binding affinity for structurally novel ligands. Our proposed work will combine these approaches. In cases where protein structural information is available, experimentally determined structures will undergo additional sampling, followed by refinement of the binding pockets based on ligand binding data in order to improve the predictions obtained from docking based upon our existing methods developed for de novo pocket construction. In addition to data-driven pocket refinement, the proposed effort requires improvement in our scoring functions for docking, taking into account vastly more data and explicit modeling of protein flexibility and of the unbound states of proteins and ligands. We will also put significant effort into algorithmic improvements that will result in typical run-times on common single-processor hardware of several minutes per ligand to yield predictions of binding geometry and affinity. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed lead optimization and computational screening exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. A shift toward novelty can be brought about if we can show that computational approaches for predicting the biological activity of small-molecules are able to make accurate predictions for structurally novel molecules. This requires significant advances over current methods for cases where a structure of the protein target is known (e.g. HIV pro- tease) and where one is not (e.g. the histamine receptor). We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our proposed combines docking approaches with data-driven approaches that make use of ligand binding data. We will use ligand binding data (which is always available to some degree in drug discovery) to improve the predictions obtained from docking in cases where protein structures are known and can be expanded through sampling. These methods rely on a novel approach to machine learning, developed by our lab. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice.

"Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays. We also plan to test 100 lower ranking sites to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our algorithms. We will also develop an oligo competition assay as a new approach to increase the throughput of experimental motif analysis for the rest of the genome.

"Computational methods for the analysis of RNA-Seq data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Technologies for the measurement of mRNA quantities within cells are key components of a biomedical researcher<s toolbox. The characterization of gene expression is important to both the understanding of the molecular biology of the cell and the diagnosis and treatment of human disease. To be most useful to scientists, RNA measurement technologies should be as accurate and precise as possible since even small perturbations in transcript levels may be significant. A recently developed experimental method, RNA-Seq, is promising to revolutionize gene expression analysis and is enabling new discoveries about the human transcriptome. RNA-Seq data demands a significant amount of computation before it can be used and the current computational methods are still in their infancy. We propose to take RNA-Seq computational methods to the next level, increasing both the accuracy of gene expression estimates and the number of scenarios in which it may be used. Using novel probabilistic models and statistical learning techniques, we will enable the technology to precisely measure alternative splicing events and characterize the transcriptomes of non-model organisms. Our computational methods will be validated with both real and simulated RNA-Seq data and will be made freely available as an open source software package. In addition, we will use the methods we develop to explore differences between the transcriptomes of undifferentiated and differentiated cells. A first application will be the characterization of alternative splicing differences between human embryonic stem cells and differentiated fibroblast cells. A second application will be the estimation of gene expression levels in embryos of the frog Xenopus leaves using the genome sequence of a closely related frog; Xenopus (Silurana) tropical is as a reference.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+ binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high- throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes.

"Developing Proteogenomic Mapping for Human Genome Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome sequencing efforts are producing ever greater quantities of raw DNA sequence, but the annotation process for locating and determining the function of genetic elements has not kept up. While many aspects of annotation are difficult, it is particularly challenging to determine which parts of a genome sequence encode proteins, and therefore how the processes leading to protein translation are regulated. Not only are technologies for examining proteins more limited than those for studying RNA transcription, in an extensive study of transcription by the Encyclopedia of DNA elements consortium, a picture of great complexity emerged. The project uncovered many novel exons, alternative splice forms, and novel regulatory elements. These results indicate that nearly 9/10ths of human genes undergo alternative splicing, and the average gene produces approximately 6 splice variants. Rather than solidify knowledge regarding the location and function of genes, these results question whether we accurately know what constitutes a gene, and how the products encoded by genes determine the function of cells. The results particularly obfuscate determination of which transcripts are selected for translation to protein, further complicating annotation efforts. To address that gap, our project will determine which transcripts encode proteins, and how these are affected in several tissue types and disease conditions. We will use large tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data sets, mapping the analyzed protein data directly to several available human genome sequences, along with sets of predicted transcripts produced by the N-SCAN and CONTRAST gene finders, to reveal which parts of transcripts are translated into proteins, and in which types of cells this translation occurs. To accomplish this, our project has three specific aims: 1) to develop high-accuracy methods and software for mapping proteomic data from mass spec analyzed proteins directly to the genome locus encoding them; 2) to develop an analysis pipeline software system using a novel rule-based information management approach; and 3) to apply these developments for the high-throughput analysis of large proteomic data sets, identifying the transcripts that encode proteins in distinct tissue types and disease conditions, and placing the results in a publicly accessible track in the UCSC genome browser. We believe this project will yield significant knowledge about the location and timing of protein translation in cells, which will potentiate further investigation of how misregulation of the path from transcription to translation leads to human disease conditions.

"Functional RNA elements in the human genome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-mRNA splicing is essential for proper gene expression in higher eukaryotic genomes, as the vast majority of genes contain introns that have to be accurately recognized and removed. Recent studies have revealed that >90% of the genes undergo alternative splicing, which is believed to contribute to the complexity of the proteome in different cell types and tissues in vertebrates and abundant evidence suggests that altered splicing causes a variety of human diseases. Despite extensive knowledge on the splicing mechanism based on biochemical dissection of model minigenes, we know little about how many genes are involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and where the functional RNA elements are embedded in the human genome.  Built on our productive research in the current award period, we now propose a bold plan to systematically attack the critical gap of our knowledge about the regulation of alternative splicing. We will pursue three major lines of research by utilizing the latest and innovative genomics technologies. (1) We will use a new, automated platform recently developed in our lab to profile hundreds of conserved alternative splicing events against every annotated genes in the human genome. This unbiased approach will generate unprecedented information to uncover novel splicing regulators and deduce pathways in regulated splicing. (2) We will focus on RNA binding proteins involved in individual regulatory pathways to elucidate the molecular basis for regulated splicing by mapping their physical interactions with expressed RNA. For this purpose, we will construct a large panel of cell lines based on FLP-In 293 cells to express individual RNA binding proteins as a V5-tagged protein at the C- terminus, which will permit large-scale mapping of RNA-protein interactions by CLIP-seq (CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing) under a similar and optimized set of conditions. (3) Our third goal is to use the information generated from the proposed mapping and functional studies to develop an integrated framework for de novo prediction of splicing regulation by using machine-learning and graphical models. This research has the potential to fundamentally change our view on splicing control and its contribution to human disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This RNA genomics project aims to deduce the splicing code in the human genome by systematic determination of genes involved in regulated splicing, elucidation of regulatory pathways, and RNA-protein interactions.

"Computational methods for the analysis of RNA-Seq data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Technologies for the measurement of mRNA quantities within cells are key components of a biomedical researcher<s toolbox. The characterization of gene expression is important to both the understanding of the molecular biology of the cell and the diagnosis and treatment of human disease. To be most useful to scientists, RNA measurement technologies should be as accurate and precise as possible since even small perturbations in transcript levels may be significant. A recently developed experimental method, RNA-Seq, is promising to revolutionize gene expression analysis and is enabling new discoveries about the human transcriptome. RNA-Seq data demands a significant amount of computation before it can be used and the current computational methods are still in their infancy. We propose to take RNA-Seq computational methods to the next level, increasing both the accuracy of gene expression estimates and the number of scenarios in which it may be used. Using novel probabilistic models and statistical learning techniques, we will enable the technology to precisely measure alternative splicing events and characterize the transcriptomes of non-model organisms. Our computational methods will be validated with both real and simulated RNA-Seq data and will be made freely available as an open source software package. In addition, we will use the methods we develop to explore differences between the transcriptomes of undifferentiated and differentiated cells. A first application will be the characterization of alternative splicing differences between human embryonic stem cells and differentiated fibroblast cells. A second application will be the estimation of gene expression levels in embryos of the frog Xenopus leaves using the genome sequence of a closely related frog; Xenopus (Silurana) tropical is as a reference.

"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          ",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,8063104,R01GM084448,"['N-terminal ', ' NH2-terminal ', ' Saccharomycetales ', ' Endomycetales ', ' Budding Yeast ', ' Tyrosine ', ' para-Tyrosine ', ' L-isomer Tyrosine ', ' L-Tyrosine ', ' histone modification ', ' Chromosomes ', ' chromatin remodeling ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Metric ', ' Arginine ', ' L-Isomer Arginine ', ' L-Arginine ', ' Chromatin ', ' Length ', ' protein function ', ' Resolution ', ' DNA Repair ', ' Unscheduled DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA Damage Repair ', ' member ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' structure function relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' Measurement ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Defect ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Technology ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Heart ', ' Reporting ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Individual ', ' Goals ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Maps ', ' Modification ', ' Scanning ', ' Work ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' insight ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' Generations ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Collaborations ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Pattern ', ' Biological ', ' mutant ', ' Genes ', ' in vivo ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Regulation ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Play ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Address ', ' Complex ', ' gene function ', ' Data ', ' Biology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic ', ' Algorithms ', ' Methods ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analysis ', ' RNA Polymerase II ', ' RNA Polymerase B ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase II ', ' Alanine ', ' L-Isomer Alanine ', ' L-Alanine ', ' Gene Order ', ' Gene Position ', ' Gene Arrangement ', ' Threonine ', ' L-Threonine ', ' Genetic Epistasis ', ' genetic epistases ', ' gene x gene interaction ', ' Interaction Deviation ', ' Epistatic Deviation ', ' Epistasis ', ' Essential Genes ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2 ', ' Chromosome 2 ', ' Glutamic Acid ', ' L-Glutamic Acid ', ' Galactose ', ' Galactopyranoside ', ' Galactopyranose ', ' D-Galactose ', ' Aspartic Acid ', ' L-Aspartic Acid ', ' genetic profiling ', ' Mycophenolic Acid ', ' Serine ', ' L-Serine ', ' Histones ', ' Lysine ', ' L-Lysine ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' Genetic Screening ', ' Histone H3 ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Histone H4 ', ' Quantitative Genetics ', ' Tail ', ' Gene Deletion ', ' gene deletion mutation ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' S.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills.

"What Made Us Human?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Comparative genomics promises to shed light on those genetic changes that gave rise to the modern human species. Mounting evidence suggests that the vast majority of functional differences between the human and chimpanzee genomes are in regions that do not code for proteins. Focusing on these non-coding regions, we will investigate lineage-specific evolution in the human genome. Our approach includes developing likelihood ratio tests for identifying changes in either the rate or the pattern of nucleotide substitution in a single lineage. These novel methods will be implemented in open source software that can be used to scan an entire genome. We will apply this evolutionary analysis to multiple sequence alignments of human and other vertebrates, including several closely related species (macaque, chimpanzee, Neanderthal), allowing us to identify recent changes in the human genome. In order to concentrate on functionally relevant changes, evolutionary testing will be limited to sets of candidate regions with specific known or predicted functions (e.g. regulatory regions, RNA genes). Predicted functional regions will be identified using machine learning classification techniques. These classifiers will employ measures of sequence conservation as well as the rapidly expanding collection of experimental and bioinformatic annotations of the human genome, including results of the ENCODE Project and other functional genomic studies. After identifying those regions that were most significantly altered in the human lineage, we will use this functional information to develop testable hypotheses about the effects of the observed changes. Experimental investigations of these genomic regions will lead to new understanding of the evolution of human biology and health.       PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project will vastly expand knowledge of biologically relevant features of the human genome that are unique to our species. Identification and characterization of the genetic changes leading to modern humans is of fundamental interest.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). This screen will be used to identify therapeutic compounds that can be used to treat DM1.              We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1).

"Wnt Signaling in Colon Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wnt signaling is one of the most common pathways linked to carcinogenesis in the intestine. The transcription factors that mediate Wnt signals are members of the Lymphoid Enhancer Factor/T Cell Factor (LEF/TCF) family. This four-member family is complex in that there are full-length activating forms, truncated dominant negative forms, and alternatively spliced isoforms that modify Wnt target gene recognition. TCF-1 and TCF-4 are the two family members expressed in the epithelial crypt compartment of the intestine. Normally, TCF-1 is expressed as a dominant negative isoform and it counteracts the action of TCF-4 which is expressed as a Wnt-mediating, active isoform. This pattern changes in cancer because TCF-1 expression switches to a full-length, Wnt mediating form. We have discovered a second DNA binding domain in TCF-1 and TCF-4 isoforms called the C-clamp. We have shown that the C-clamp is important for regulating cell proliferation of colon cancer cells. We have also identified Wnts that trigger TCF-1 export in colon cancer cells. Export of TCF-1 leaves the C-clamp form of TCF-4 in the nucleus to mediate aberrant Wnt signaling. Three aims are proposed for this project. First, the extracellular Wnts and intracellular components that direct TCF-1 nuclear export will be defined (Aim1). Second, the biological impact of export will be defined in colon cancer cells and colon cancer initiating 3D cultures (Aim2). Third, the DNA binding specificities and target gene selection of C-clamp forms of TCF-1 and TCF-4 will be defined through genome-wide binding assays (ChIP-Seq), high-throughput protein binding microarrays, and in vitro biochemical analysis (Aim3). The overall goal is to define the mechanisms behind changes in TCF expression in colon carcinogenesis, and to define how extracellular Wnts and DNA binding specificities of TCFs influence aberrant signaling in colon cancer cells with stabilized ?-catenin.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In colon cancer, Wnt signaling is an overactive and strong signal for tumor initiation and progression. Wnt signaling is mediated by the TCF transcription factors and we have discovered their activities and expression to be different in colon cancer versus normal colon tissue. This project investigates basic mechanisms of TCF localization and gene targeting and asks how differences in these attributes contribute to the cancer cell phenotype.              In colon cancer, Wnt signaling is an overactive and strong signal for tumor initiation and progression.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.            Project Narrative The explosion in data related to molecular biology has created great opportunities for new disease diagnostics and therapies.

"Developing Proteogenomic Mapping for Human Genome Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome sequencing efforts are producing ever greater quantities of raw DNA sequence, but the annotation process for locating and determining the function of genetic elements has not kept up. While many aspects of annotation are difficult, it is particularly challenging to determine which parts of a genome sequence encode proteins, and therefore how the processes leading to protein translation are regulated. Not only are technologies for examining proteins more limited than those for studying RNA transcription, in an extensive study of transcription by the Encyclopedia of DNA elements consortium, a picture of great complexity emerged. The project uncovered many novel exons, alternative splice forms, and novel regulatory elements. These results indicate that nearly 9/10ths of human genes undergo alternative splicing, and the average gene produces approximately 6 splice variants. Rather than solidify knowledge regarding the location and function of genes, these results question whether we accurately know what constitutes a gene, and how the products encoded by genes determine the function of cells. The results particularly obfuscate determination of which transcripts are selected for translation to protein, further complicating annotation efforts. To address that gap, our project will determine which transcripts encode proteins, and how these are affected in several tissue types and disease conditions. We will use large tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data sets, mapping the analyzed protein data directly to several available human genome sequences, along with sets of predicted transcripts produced by the N-SCAN and CONTRAST gene finders, to reveal which parts of transcripts are translated into proteins, and in which types of cells this translation occurs. To accomplish this, our project has three specific aims: 1) to develop high-accuracy methods and software for mapping proteomic data from mass spec analyzed proteins directly to the genome locus encoding them; 2) to develop an analysis pipeline software system using a novel rule-based information management approach; and 3) to apply these developments for the high-throughput analysis of large proteomic data sets, identifying the transcripts that encode proteins in distinct tissue types and disease conditions, and placing the results in a publicly accessible track in the UCSC genome browser. We believe this project will yield significant knowledge about the location and timing of protein translation in cells, which will potentiate further investigation of how misregulation of the path from transcription to translation leads to human disease conditions.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Sequencing of the human genome is complete, but figuring out where genes are located, how they function, and how they cause or prevent human diseases like cancer has only just begun.

"Data-Driven Approaches for Molecular Docking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are used for predicting ligand binding modes, ligand binding affinities, and for computational screening to identify new specific ligands for biological targets of pharmaceutical relevance. Current approaches are characterized by high inter-target variability and sharp limitations in ability to make accurate predictions for new ligands that are structurally different from known ones. Approaches that model protein flexibility directly or approach simulation-level detail in complex molecular systems have shown some success. However, they are generally applicable only in low throughput and in cases where high-quality experimentally determined protein target structures are available. This is in part why ""me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. Such drugs generally bring much less pharmacological novelty to patient treatment than structurally novel therapeutics. We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our recent work has established an approach to treating protein flexibility in docking that addresses large protein movements by considering multiple experimental structures and small ligand-dependent movements by protein/ligand complex relaxation beginning from many putative ligand dockings. We have also established an approach for de novo protein pocket induction that constructs a binding site based solely on ligand binding data that is capable of making accurate predictions of binding geometry and binding affinity for structurally novel ligands. Our proposed work will combine these approaches. In cases where protein structural information is available, experimentally determined structures will undergo additional sampling, followed by refinement of the binding pockets based on ligand binding data in order to improve the predictions obtained from docking based upon our existing methods developed for de novo pocket construction. In addition to data-driven pocket refinement, the proposed effort requires improvement in our scoring functions for docking, taking into account vastly more data and explicit modeling of protein flexibility and of the unbound states of proteins and ligands. We will also put significant effort into algorithmic improvements that will result in typical run-times on common single-processor hardware of several minutes per ligand to yield predictions of binding geometry and affinity. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed lead optimization and computational screening exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. A shift toward novelty can be brought about if we can show that computational approaches for predicting the biological activity of small-molecules are able to make accurate predictions for structurally novel molecules. This requires significant advances over current methods for cases where a structure of the protein target is known (e.g. HIV pro- tease) and where one is not (e.g. the histamine receptor). We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our proposed combines docking approaches with data-driven approaches that make use of ligand binding data. We will use ligand binding data (which is always available to some degree in drug discovery) to improve the predictions obtained from docking in cases where protein structures are known and can be expanded through sampling. These methods rely on a novel approach to machine learning, developed by our lab.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+ binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies.

"Computational methods for the analysis of RNA-Seq data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Technologies for the measurement of mRNA quantities within cells are key components of a biomedical researcher<s toolbox. The characterization of gene expression is important to both the understanding of the molecular biology of the cell and the diagnosis and treatment of human disease. To be most useful to scientists, RNA measurement technologies should be as accurate and precise as possible since even small perturbations in transcript levels may be significant. A recently developed experimental method, RNA-Seq, is promising to revolutionize gene expression analysis and is enabling new discoveries about the human transcriptome. RNA-Seq data demands a significant amount of computation before it can be used and the current computational methods are still in their infancy. We propose to take RNA-Seq computational methods to the next level, increasing both the accuracy of gene expression estimates and the number of scenarios in which it may be used. Using novel probabilistic models and statistical learning techniques, we will enable the technology to precisely measure alternative splicing events and characterize the transcriptomes of non-model organisms. Our computational methods will be validated with both real and simulated RNA-Seq data and will be made freely available as an open source software package. In addition, we will use the methods we develop to explore differences between the transcriptomes of undifferentiated and differentiated cells. A first application will be the characterization of alternative splicing differences between human embryonic stem cells and differentiated fibroblast cells. A second application will be the estimation of gene expression levels in embryos of the frog Xenopus leaves using the genome sequence of a closely related frog; Xenopus (Silurana) tropical is as a reference. The results of these experiments are expected to advance our understanding of cellular differentiation in vertebrates and, ultimately, the potential for stem cells to be used in the treatment of human diseases and injuries.

"Data-Driven Approaches for Molecular Docking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are used for predicting ligand binding modes, ligand binding affinities, and for computational screening to identify new specific ligands for biological targets of pharmaceutical relevance. Current approaches are characterized by high inter-target variability and sharp limitations in ability to make accurate predictions for new ligands that are structurally different from known ones. Approaches that model protein flexibility directly or approach simulation-level detail in complex molecular systems have shown some success. However, they are generally applicable only in low throughput and in cases where high-quality experimentally determined protein target structures are available. This is in part why ""me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. Such drugs generally bring much less pharmacological novelty to patient treatment than structurally novel therapeutics. We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our recent work has established an approach to treating protein flexibility in docking that addresses large protein movements by considering multiple experimental structures and small ligand-dependent movements by protein/ligand complex relaxation beginning from many putative ligand dockings. We have also established an approach for de novo protein pocket induction that constructs a binding site based solely on ligand binding data that is capable of making accurate predictions of binding geometry and binding affinity for structurally novel ligands. Our proposed work will combine these approaches. In cases where protein structural information is available, experimentally determined structures will undergo additional sampling, followed by refinement of the binding pockets based on ligand binding data in order to improve the predictions obtained from docking based upon our existing methods developed for de novo pocket construction. In addition to data-driven pocket refinement, the proposed effort requires improvement in our scoring functions for docking, taking into account vastly more data and explicit modeling of protein flexibility and of the unbound states of proteins and ligands. We will also put significant effort into algorithmic improvements that will result in typical run-times on common single-processor hardware of several minutes per ligand to yield predictions of binding geometry and affinity. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed lead optimization and computational screening exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.          We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). This screen will be used to identify therapeutic compounds that can be used to treat DM1.

"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders.

"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need.

"Unlocking transcript diversity via differential analyses of splice graphs Abstract A most basic difference between cells of the same genotype and different phenotype lies in their transcriptome. Understanding the difference between two transcriptomes in terms of the RNA molecules present in each, or changes in abundance of specific molecules, can offer valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of disease, development, and specialization. High throughput sequencing provides a unique view of the transcriptome in the form of millions or even billions of short reads of nucleotide sequences sampled from the RNA molecules. To date, nearly 1000 such RNA-seq datasets have already been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. Beyond measuring differences in overall expression of genes between samples, there is a critical need to measure differences in expression at the transcript level. Computational tools that can extract significant changes in transcript diversity across populations with RNA-seq are in immediate demand. However, reconstructing the full extent of transcript isoforms from this wealth of data is not a solved problem because of fundamental ambiguities between isoforms at the scale of the short read samples.  We propose a novel approach to the differential analysis of transcriptomes that does not depend on the reconstruction of the full-length transcripts, and yet can accurately pinpoint the variation of transcriptomes. Our techniques are data-driven and applicable to any transcriptome, requiring only a reference genome, and do not depend on a priori gene structure annotations. Our research program builds on our highly sensitive and accurate MapSplice alignment algorithm to construct expression weighted splice graphs (ESG) from RNA-seq datasets. ESGs can be three orders of magnitude smaller in size than current RNA-seq datasets, yet fully represent the substantive biological content of such datasets. The ESG representation supports highly efficient analysis techniques that can directly identify and visualize statistically significant differential transcription between samples. Generalizations of the algorithms are proposed to identify co-regulated splicing patterns that are keys for biological pathway analyses and systems biology analyses.  We have established an ongoing interactive and collaborative research environment among the co-PIs and Co-Is which include the biologists, computer scientists and statistician. The proposed computational methods will be tested and refined using RNA-seq data generated from breast cancer cell lines before being further applied to three well curated RNA-seq datasets on lung cancer pathogenesis, stem cells in leukemia, and equine articular cartilage development and repair (a non-model mammalian organism). Experimental validation of differentially expressed transcript isoforms will both improve the accuracy of our methods, as well as propose novel candidates for alternative isoforms associated with lung cancer,and leukemia diseases, and chondrocyte differentiation.  The software will be open-source and will be developed as a set of components that can be used on their own or integrated into RNA-seq processing workflows. In particular we will integrate the components into the Galaxy cloud computing framework hosted on a local server. As such the methods will be available to researchers worldwide. As components mature they may be installed in other servers worldwide to provide a convenient and secure way to analyze transcriptomes.  Unveiling the dynamics of the transcriptome at modest cost will revolutionize cellular diagnostics and biomedical research. Genome-wide measurement of transcription variants offers the potential for detailed molecular information about cellular identity and function that will greatly expand traditional histological assessment. Cloud-based access to the methods can turn individual laboratories into small genome centers and will enable individual scientists to assess differences among RNA transcriptomes in a matter of days. Our suite of algorithms will enable biomedical researchers to prioritize candidate genes or different gene ontology categories to investigate further for differential transcription and mechanistic importance between experimental conditions. Project Narrative  This project will develop new techniques to compare the transcriptome of different cells, sampled using high-throughput sequencing technology. As the transcriptome consists of the RNA ""instructions"" controlling the cell's functions, differential analysis can provide detailed insight into the difference between healthy and diseased cells, or can be used to more clearly discover the functional differences between, say, liver cells and brain cells.",Unlocking transcript diversity via differential analyses of splice

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions PROJECT SUMMARY  Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would  provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular  receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models  will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+- binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction  domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high-  throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity. Relevance  Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes. Knowledge of interactions that occur in healthy vs. diseased tissues, coupled with methods for inhibiting such interactions, would dramatically expand opportunities to treat human disease.

"Functional RNA elements in the human genome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-mRNA splicing is essential for proper gene expression in higher eukaryotic genomes, as the vast majority of genes contain introns that have to be accurately recognized and removed. Recent studies have revealed that >90% of the genes undergo alternative splicing, which is believed to contribute to the complexity of the proteome in different cell types and tissues in vertebrates and abundant evidence suggests that altered splicing causes a variety of human diseases. Despite extensive knowledge on the splicing mechanism based on biochemical dissection of model minigenes, we know little about how many genes are involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and where the functional RNA elements are embedded in the human genome.  Built on our productive research in the current award period, we now propose a bold plan to systematically attack the critical gap of our knowledge about the regulation of alternative splicing. We will pursue three major lines of research by utilizing the latest and innovative genomics technologies. (1) We will use a new, automated platform recently developed in our lab to profile hundreds of conserved alternative splicing events against every annotated genes in the human genome. This unbiased approach will generate unprecedented information to uncover novel splicing regulators and deduce pathways in regulated splicing. (2) We will focus on RNA binding proteins involved in individual regulatory pathways to elucidate the molecular basis for regulated splicing by mapping their physical interactions with expressed RNA. For this purpose, we will construct a large panel of cell lines based on FLP-In 293 cells to express individual RNA binding proteins as a V5-tagged protein at the C- terminus, which will permit large-scale mapping of RNA-protein interactions by CLIP-seq (CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing) under a similar and optimized set of conditions. (3) Our third goal is to use the information generated from the proposed mapping and functional studies to develop an integrated framework for de novo prediction of splicing regulation by using machine-learning and graphical models. This research has the potential to fundamentally change our view on splicing control and its contribution to human disease.       This RNA genomics project aims to deduce the splicing code in the human genome by systematic determination of genes involved in regulated splicing, elucidation of regulatory pathways, and RNA-protein interactions.

"Wnt Signaling in Colon Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wnt signaling is one of the most common pathways linked to carcinogenesis in the intestine. The transcription factors that mediate Wnt signals are members of the Lymphoid Enhancer Factor/T Cell Factor (LEF/TCF) family. This four-member family is complex in that there are full-length activating forms, truncated dominant negative forms, and alternatively spliced isoforms that modify Wnt target gene recognition. TCF-1 and TCF-4 are the two family members expressed in the epithelial crypt compartment of the intestine. Normally, TCF-1 is expressed as a dominant negative isoform and it counteracts the action of TCF-4 which is expressed as a Wnt-mediating, active isoform. This pattern changes in cancer because TCF-1 expression switches to a full-length, Wnt mediating form. We have discovered a second DNA binding domain in TCF-1 and TCF-4 isoforms called the C-clamp. We have shown that the C-clamp is important for regulating cell proliferation of colon cancer cells. We have also identified Wnts that trigger TCF-1 export in colon cancer cells. Export of TCF-1 leaves the C-clamp form of TCF-4 in the nucleus to mediate aberrant Wnt signaling. Three aims are proposed for this project. First, the extracellular Wnts and intracellular components that direct TCF-1 nuclear export will be defined (Aim1). Second, the biological impact of export will be defined in colon cancer cells and colon cancer initiating 3D cultures (Aim2). Third, the DNA binding specificities and target gene selection of C-clamp forms of TCF-1 and TCF-4 will be defined through genome-wide binding assays (ChIP-Seq), high-throughput protein binding microarrays, and in vitro biochemical analysis (Aim3). The overall goal is to define the mechanisms behind changes in TCF expression in colon carcinogenesis, and to define how extracellular Wnts and DNA binding specificities of TCFs influence aberrant signaling in colon cancer cells with stabilized ?-catenin.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In colon cancer, Wnt signaling is an overactive and strong signal for tumor initiation and progression. Wnt signaling is mediated by the TCF transcription factors and we have discovered their activities and expression to be different in colon cancer versus normal colon tissue.

"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach Project Summary/Abstract We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semi- systematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells. Project Narrative/Relevance to Public Health The interplay between the gene expression machinery and the compaction of genetic material into chromatin is now recognized as highly dynamic and complex. These processes must be tightly controlled for normal cellular physiology and to prevent disease states such as cancer. We will use a systems approach to genetically dissect the structural and functional relationships between the highly conserved components of these pathways in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, in order to more easily understand and eventually manipulate the vast complexity of human cells.

"Structure based prediction of the interactome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular interactions play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are of particular interest as they are critical in maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Although high-throughput experimental PPI and PRI data is rapidly accumulating, building complete and confident datasets requires multiple replicates of expensive screens. This proposal aims to develop new methods that will significantly advance our efforts at structure-based approaches to better predict PPIs and RPIs and boost confidence in emerging high-throughput (HTP) data with the goal of comprehensive interactome mapping at lower cost. Taken together, these methods will vastly expand our understanding of macromolecular networks. We will continue to devise structure-based methods for protein-protein interaction prediction and branch out to methods for protein-RNA interaction prediction; this represents a major shift from the purely sequence-based approaches that most bioinformatics approaches utilize to predict  We will also build computational frameworks for boosting confidence in HTP protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction datasets using structure-based approaches; these frameworks will provide a comprehensive assessment of in-house and public HTP data, with potential biomedical applications such as heat shock protein-kinase interactions related to development for cancer therapeutics, MAPK6's role in a cancer-related signaling network, and (long non-coding) RNA-protein binding roles in neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we will computationally screen for PPIs and PRIs at the genome scale and expand our Struct2Net webserver to disseminate tools based on our methods and results to the community. An increasing number of HTP interaction datasets are being determined, thus presenting new opportunities to leverage this data in conjunction with structural insights to map binding sites and to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of cellular functions. molecular interactions and will enhance coverage and accuracy of the complete interactome. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods that will significantly increase our confidence in high-throughput data on protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and will reveal fundamental aspects of their functioning, as well as testable hypotheses for experimental investigations.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community.

"Unlocking transcript diversity via differential analyses of splice graphs Abstract A most basic difference between cells of the same genotype and different phenotype lies in their transcriptome. Understanding the difference between two transcriptomes in terms of the RNA molecules present in each, or changes in abundance of specific molecules, can offer valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of disease, development, and specialization. High throughput sequencing provides a unique view of the transcriptome in the form of millions or even billions of short reads of nucleotide sequences sampled from the RNA molecules. To date, nearly 1000 such RNA-seq datasets have already been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. Beyond measuring differences in overall expression of genes between samples, there is a critical need to measure differences in expression at the transcript level. Computational tools that can extract significant changes in transcript diversity across populations with RNA-seq are in immediate demand. However, reconstructing the full extent of transcript isoforms from this wealth of data is not a solved problem because of fundamental ambiguities between isoforms at the scale of the short read samples.  We propose a novel approach to the differential analysis of transcriptomes that does not depend on the reconstruction of the full-length transcripts, and yet can accurately pinpoint the variation of transcriptomes. Our techniques are data-driven and applicable to any transcriptome, requiring only a reference genome, and do not depend on a priori gene structure annotations. Our research program builds on our highly sensitive and accurate MapSplice alignment algorithm to construct expression weighted splice graphs (ESG) from RNA-seq datasets. ESGs can be three orders of magnitude smaller in size than current RNA-seq datasets, yet fully represent the substantive biological content of such datasets. The ESG representation supports highly efficient analysis techniques that can directly identify and visualize statistically significant differential transcription between samples. Generalizations of the algorithms are proposed to identify co-regulated splicing patterns that are keys for biological pathway analyses and systems biology analyses.  We have established an ongoing interactive and collaborative research environment among the co-PIs and Co-Is which include the biologists, computer scientists and statistician. The proposed computational methods will be tested and refined using RNA-seq data generated from breast cancer cell lines before being further applied to three well curated RNA-seq datasets on lung cancer pathogenesis, stem cells in leukemia, and equine articular cartilage development and repair (a non-model mammalian organism). Experimental validation of differentially expressed transcript isoforms will both improve the accuracy of our methods, as well as propose novel candidates for alternative isoforms associated with lung cancer,and leukemia diseases, and chondrocyte differentiation.  The software will be open-source and will be developed as a set of components that can be used on their own or integrated into RNA-seq processing workflows. In particular we will integrate the components into the Galaxy cloud computing framework hosted on a local server. As such the methods will be available to researchers worldwide. As components mature they may be installed in other servers worldwide to provide a convenient and secure way to analyze transcriptomes.  Unveiling the dynamics of the transcriptome at modest cost will revolutionize cellular diagnostics and biomedical research. Genome-wide measurement of transcription variants offers the potential for detailed molecular information about cellular identity and function that will greatly expand traditional histological assessment. Cloud-based access to the methods can turn individual laboratories into small genome centers and will enable individual scientists to assess differences among RNA transcriptomes in a matter of days. Our suite of algorithms will enable biomedical researchers to prioritize candidate genes or different gene ontology categories to investigate further for differential transcription and mechanistic importance between experimental conditions. Project Narrative  This project will develop new techniques to compare the transcriptome of different cells, sampled using high-throughput sequencing technology. As the transcriptome consists of the RNA ""instructions"" controlling the cell's functions, differential analysis can provide detailed insight into the difference between healthy and diseased cells,

"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain.          Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders. This proposal seeks to establish the interactions among selected RBPs and their functional RNA elements in mammalian neurons. This will be a crucial first step in elucidating the RNA networks regulated by these RBPs in the brain.

"An integrative approach to construct a regulatory network effected by TDZs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic disorders. Obesit typically leads to accumulation of dysfunctional white adipose tissue (WAT), which further causes metabolic dysregulation with elevated circulation of fatty acids and increased secretion of proinflammatory adipokines. The discovery of fat burning brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has raised the exciting possibility of BAT may be targeted as a novel method to treat obesity and metablic diseases. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have a function to convert WAT into a ""brownlike"" state. Beside, TZDs have been used as a remedy for diabetes. But the clinical use of TZDs has been limited because of the safety concerns such as potential cardiovascular risks. Understanding the mechanism will identify efficacious but lower risk drug targets for the metabolic disorders. TZDs act by activatin PPAR? (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ?). However, our understanding about the targets f PPAR? and other cofactors is limited. To understand the role of TZDs and further study the browning effect, we propose to develop a novel algorithm to predict long-range promoter-enhancer interaction and construct a transcriptional network. To predict the long-range interactions, we will employ a machine learning algorithm that uses the enhancer RNA (eRNA) levels and gene transcription levels obtained from global run-on sequencing (GROseq) data. GROseq is a useful dataset to predict long-range interactions, as the eRNA levels highly correlate with the gene transcription level. Applyingthe obtained interactions to the known binding sites of TFs including PPAR?, GR, C/EBP, SMRT, and RXR, we will construct a comprehensive TF-gene network. The predicted interaction provides a useful environment to study gene regulation of TZDs. We will study how the distance, relative position, an the combination of multiple TF binding sites affect gene expression. We will also investigate the browning effects by TZDs by including BAT-specific TF binding data in the network. The transcriptioal rule of the BAT-specific binding information, in combination with other TFs, will be analyzed from he TF-gene network. As a whole, these studies use an innovative and creative approach to integrate various types of data to study gene regulation of TZDs. By reprocessing complex genomic datasets ino a comprehensive regulatory network, the proposed algorithm provides a unique view in analyzing the regulatory rules of the browning effect, which will greatly enhance our understanding about the gen regulation of TZDs and identify potential therapeutic targets for diabetes.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A noble algorithm is developed to reprocess and integrate various types of data in a regulatory network to the study of the browning effect by thiazolidinedione (TZD). We will develop a novel algorithm to predict promoter-enhancer long-range interactions using the glbal run-on sequencing (GROseq) data and construct regulatory network using the known transcription factor binding sites.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks  Project summary It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions PROJECT SUMMARY  Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would  provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular  receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models  will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+- binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction  domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high-  throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity. Relevance  Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes. Knowledge of interactions that occur in healthy vs. diseased tissues, coupled with methods for inhibiting such interactions, would dramatically expand opportunities to treat human disease.

"Wnt Signaling in Colon Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wnt signaling is one of the most common pathways linked to carcinogenesis in the intestine. The transcription factors that mediate Wnt signals are members of the Lymphoid Enhancer Factor/T Cell Factor (LEF/TCF) family. This four-member family is complex in that there are full-length activating forms, truncated dominant negative forms, and alternatively spliced isoforms that modify Wnt target gene recognition. TCF-1 and TCF-4 are the two family members expressed in the epithelial crypt compartment of the intestine. Normally, TCF-1 is expressed as a dominant negative isoform and it counteracts the action of TCF-4 which is expressed as a Wnt-mediating, active isoform. This pattern changes in cancer because TCF-1 expression switches to a full-length, Wnt mediating form. We have discovered a second DNA binding domain in TCF-1 and TCF-4 isoforms called the C-clamp. We have shown that the C-clamp is important for regulating cell proliferation of colon cancer cells. We have also identified Wnts that trigger TCF-1 export in colon cancer cells. Export of TCF-1 leaves the C-clamp form of TCF-4 in the nucleus to mediate aberrant Wnt signaling. Three aims are proposed for this project. First, the extracellular Wnts and intracellular components that direct TCF-1 nuclear export will be defined (Aim1). Second, the biological impact of export will be defined in colon cancer cells and colon cancer initiating 3D cultures (Aim2). Third, the DNA binding specificities and target gene selection of C-clamp forms of TCF-1 and TCF-4 will be defined through genome-wide binding assays (ChIP-Seq), high-throughput protein binding microarrays, and in vitro biochemical analysis (Aim3). The overall goal is to define the mechanisms behind changes in TCF expression in colon carcinogenesis, and to define how extracellular Wnts and DNA binding specificities of TCFs influence aberrant signaling in colon cancer cells with stabilized ?-catenin.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In colon cancer, Wnt signaling is an overactive and strong signal for tumor initiation and progression.

"Data-Driven Approaches for Molecular Docking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are used for predicting ligand binding modes, ligand binding affinities, and for computational screening to identify new specific ligands for biological targets of pharmaceutical relevance. Current approaches are characterized by high inter-target variability and sharp limitations in ability to make accurate predictions for new ligands that are structurally different from known ones. Approaches that model protein flexibility directly or approach simulation-level detail in complex molecular systems have shown some success. However, they are generally applicable only in low throughput and in cases where high-quality experimentally determined protein target structures are available. This is in part why ""me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. Such drugs generally bring much less pharmacological novelty to patient treatment than structurally novel therapeutics. We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our recent work has established an approach to treating protein flexibility in docking that addresses large protein movements by considering multiple experimental structures and small ligand-dependent movements by protein/ligand complex relaxation beginning from many putative ligand dockings. We have also established an approach for de novo protein pocket induction that constructs a binding site based solely on ligand binding data that is capable of making accurate predictions of binding geometry and binding affinity for structurally novel ligands. Our proposed work will combine these approaches. In cases where protein structural information is available, experimentally determined structures will undergo additional sampling, followed by refinement of the binding pockets based on ligand binding data in order to improve the predictions obtained from docking based upon our existing methods developed for de novo pocket construction. In addition to data-driven pocket refinement, the proposed effort requires improvement in our scoring functions for docking, taking into account vastly more data and explicit modeling of protein flexibility and of the unbound states of proteins and ligands. We will also put significant effort into algorithmic improvements that will result in typical run-times on common single-processor hardware of several minutes per ligand to yield predictions of binding geometry and affinity. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed lead optimization and computational screening exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. A shift toward novelty can be brought about if we can show that computational approaches for predicting the biological activity of small-molecules are able to make accurate predictions for structurally novel molecules. This requires significant advances over current methods for cases where a structure of the protein target is known (e.g. HIV pro- tease) and where one is not (e.g. the histamine receptor). We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our proposed combines docking approaches with data-driven approaches that make use of ligand binding data. We will use ligand binding data (which is always available to some degree in drug discovery) to improve the predictions obtained from docking in cases where protein structures are known and can be expanded through sampling. These methods rely on a novel approach to machine learning, developed by our lab. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed drug lead optimization and computational screening exercises.

"Structure based prediction of the interactome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular interactions play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are of particular interest as they are critical in maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Although high-throughput experimental PPI and PRI data is rapidly accumulating, building complete and confident datasets requires multiple replicates of expensive screens. This proposal aims to develop new methods that will significantly advance our efforts at structure-based approaches to better predict PPIs and RPIs and boost confidence in emerging high-throughput (HTP) data with the goal of comprehensive interactome mapping at lower cost. Taken together, these methods will vastly expand our understanding of macromolecular networks. We will continue to devise structure-based methods for protein-protein interaction prediction and branch out to methods for protein-RNA interaction prediction; this represents a major shift from the purely sequence-based approaches that most bioinformatics approaches utilize to predict  We will also build computational frameworks for boosting confidence in HTP protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction datasets using structure-based approaches; these frameworks will provide a comprehensive assessment of in-house and public HTP data, with potential biomedical applications such as heat shock protein-kinase interactions related to development for cancer therapeutics, MAPK6's role in a cancer-related signaling network, and (long non-coding) RNA-protein binding roles in neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we will computationally screen for PPIs and PRIs at the genome scale and expand our Struct2Net webserver to disseminate tools based on our methods and results to the community. An increasing number of HTP interaction datasets are being determined, thus presenting new opportunities to leverage this data in conjunction with structural insights to map binding sites and to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of cellular functions. molecular interactions and will enhance coverage and accuracy of the complete interactome. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods that will significantly increase our confidence in high-throughput data on protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and will reveal fundamental aspects of their functioning, as well as testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. All developed software will be made publicly available.          Biological processes are carried out through thousands of interactions between various types of molecules (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.          We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). This screen will be used to identify therapeutic compounds that can be used to treat DM1.

"Functional RNA elements in the human genome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-mRNA splicing is essential for proper gene expression in higher eukaryotic genomes, as the vast majority of genes contain introns that have to be accurately recognized and removed. Recent studies have revealed that >90% of the genes undergo alternative splicing, which is believed to contribute to the complexity of the proteome in different cell types and tissues in vertebrates and abundant evidence suggests that altered splicing causes a variety of human diseases. Despite extensive knowledge on the splicing mechanism based on biochemical dissection of model minigenes, we know little about how many genes are involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and where the functional RNA elements are embedded in the human genome. Built on our productive research in the current award period, we now propose a bold plan to systematically attack the critical gap of our knowledge about the regulation of alternative splicing. We will pursue three major lines of research by utilizing the latest and innovative genomics technologies. (1) We will use a new, automated platform recently developed in our lab to profile hundreds of conserved alternative splicing events against every annotated genes in the human genome. This unbiased approach will generate unprecedented information to uncover novel splicing regulators and deduce pathways in regulated splicing. (2) We will focus on RNA binding proteins involved in individual regulatory pathways to elucidate the molecular basis for regulated splicing by mapping their physical interactions with expressed RNA. For this purpose, we will construct a large panel of cell lines based on FLP-In 293 cells to express individual RNA binding proteins as a V5-tagged protein at the C- terminus, which will permit large-scale mapping of RNA-protein interactions by CLIP-seq (CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing) under a similar and optimized set of conditions. (3) Our third goal is to use the information generated from the proposed mapping and functional studies to develop an integrated framework for de novo prediction of splicing regulation by using machine-learning and graphical models. This research has the potential to fundamentally change our view on splicing control and its contribution to human disease. This RNA genomics project aims to deduce the splicing code in the human genome by systematic determination of genes involved in regulated splicing, elucidation of regulatory pathways, and RNA-protein interactions.

"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale. First, we will develop a maximum likelihood approach that estimates RNA secondary structure using RNA-seq assays that preferentially sequence single- or double-stranded nucleotides. Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms.

"miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid in CFS ABSTRACT: ""miRNA in CSF of CFS""   Exosomes are membrane-bound microvesicles (Figure 1) Figure 1. Exosome formation.  that are released from cells and mediate cell-to-cell transfer of  short (22-25 nucleotides), noncoding, message inhibitory RNAs  (miRNAs), genomic DNA, proteins and membrane lipids. The  exosome surface has CD9, CD63, CD81 and other ligands that  bind to integrins and other receptors on endothelium and other  target cells. The exosome and target cell membranes fuse and  miRNAs are released into the cytoplasm. Proinflammatory roles  include transport of transforming growth factor-ß, and secretion of  nitric oxide, reactive oxidant species, IL-1ß and IL-18. Exosomes  may act as circulating hormone- or virus-like inflammasomes to  transmit injury signals in organs such as the brain. Pre- and post-  synaptic neurons and glia have active exosome systems that contribute to neural plasticity, but that also  transport amyloid, tau and prion proteins and rabies viruses.   miRNAs are products of short genes that are scattered throughout the genome. They bind to precise  sequences in selected mRNAs. The binding prevents translation of the target mRNA and prevents protein  synthesis. Over 1500 human miRNAs regulate about 50% of known proteins in cell-specific fashion.  Exosome miRNAs may initiate, expand, and maintain dysfunctional phenotypes by preventing the expression  of critical proteins in targeted cells. miRNAs may be biomarkers of aging, mild cognitive impairment,  Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, cardiomyopathy, and other diseases. In human synapses, ten miRNAs regulate  80% of the 242 presynaptic and 304 post-synaptic proteins. Analysis of pooled specimens of cerebrospinal  fluid by next generation RNA sequencing (NGS) identified 133 unique miRNAs. However, NGS is currently  inefficient for studying the patterns of miRNAs from individual subjects. This is because the yield of miRNA is  low so that >2 ml of cerebrospinal fluid per individual subject may be needed, or the samples pooled between  subjects. Therefore, we propose to use quantitative PCR of miRNAs for this cerebrospinal fluid study.   Exosome proteins include RNA-binding heat shock and other cytoplasmic proteins; cell surface  receptors such as CD9, CD63, CD81 and HLA-G; and other transmembrane proteins. These may reveal the  nature of the cell type that secreted the exosome.   Preliminary Data. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Gulf War Illness (GWI) veterans who also met  CFS criteria have demonstrated significant, specific, central nervous system dysfunction. GWI subsets have  been identified. miRNA contributes to these GWI subsets. This suggests objectively defined CFS phenotypes  may also be discovered and discriminated by miRNA patterns (""biosignatures""). Exosome RNA, protein, and  lipid components can be purified from fresh and -80°C frozen CSF. NGS was performed on cerebrospinal fluid  from sedentary control (SC) subjects at rest and two subsets of GWI subjects defined by their magnetic  resonance imaging and responses to exercise. The 3 groups had unique miRNA patterns. MIR22 had  equivalent levels in SC and the Stress Test Associated Reversible Tachycardia (START) and Stress Test  Originated Phantom Perception (STOPP) specimens. Eleven miRNAs were found in only in SC. START had 7  unique miRNAs, and STOPP had 2 unique miRNAs. These patterns may provide insights into mechanisms of  exercise-induced malaise, pain, autonomic and cognitive dysfunction as well as being phenotype - specific  biomarkers. These data from GWI with CFS suggest phenotypes and specific miRNAs biomarkers in CFS.   Objective. Like GWI, CFS is a heterogenous disorder with latent phenotypes that can be identified  from specific combinations of miRNAs expressed in cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. This unique hypothesis  presumes that subsets of CFS have specific patterns of brain cell miRNAs. Distinct patterns of exosome  miRNA and protein expression will discern CFS subjects from SC, and provide biomarkers for diagnosis.  Exosome proteins may identify presynaptic, postsynaptic, microglial, astrocyte, or oligodendrocyte cells of  origin. Drugs that target exosome biology may be beneficial in CFS or selected CFS phenotypes.   SPECIFIC AIM 1: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. Use quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-  PCR) to identify the patterns of 380 miRNAs expressed in individual CFS and SC subjects before and after  exercise. Determine patterns that discriminate CFS from SC, and identify latent phenotypes of CFS subjects.  Characterize the miRNA-regulated proteins and infer the consequences for CFS brain biology.   SPECIFIC AIM 2: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes and purify their proteins. Perform mass  spectrometry for proteomic identification of exosome proteins. Determine the potential sources of the  exosomes based on these proteins, and potential target cells based on the nature of the exosome surface  receptors, transmembrane and intravesicular proteins. PROJECT NARRATIVE  miRNAs (messenger inhibiting RNA) in cerebrospinal fluid from Gulf War Illness subjects who also  met CFS criteria was significantly altered compared to sedentary control subjects. Two GWI/CFS  phenotypes were identified. This suggests miRNA may provide objective insights into CFS  pathophysiology, biomarkers, and potential mechanisms and future treatments. The miRNAs are  contained in lipid-bound vesicles, or exosomes. We will assay the proteins in the exosomes to  identify the cells of origin and potential targets for these enveloped virus-like microvesicles.",miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid in

"Molecular Mechanisms of Telomere Length Homeostasis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Telomere integrity is essential for cell survival and proliferation. Accordingly, dysfunctional telomeres can initiate genomic instability, cellular senescence, and organismal aging. Telomere structure is provided by binding of shelterin to telomeric DNA repeats forming a nucleoprotein complex. Similar to the human shelterin, in fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, shelterin is composed of telomeric sequence-specific double-stranded and single-stranded DNA binding proteins, Taz1 and Pot1, respectively, accompanied by their protein interaction partners, Rap1, Poz1, and Tpz1, which form a ""protein bridge"" connecting Taz1 and Pot1. Shelterin protects telomere integrity as well as regulates telomerase. With the parent grant support, we biochemically identified Tpz1 mutants that can individually but specifically disrupt its interactions with Poz1, Ccq1, or Pot1. Using these separation-of-function mutants of Tpz1, we found that the complete linkage between telomere dsDNA and ssDNA binding proteins within the shelterin complex is required for defining the telomerase-nonextendible state of telomeres. Moreover, epistasis analyses revealed that Tpz1 also participates in the activation of telomeres to the extendible state via its interaction with Ccq1. Our results suggest critical regulatory roles of Tpz1 in the telomere ON/OFF binary switch. Here, we request supplemental funds to use emerging technologies and interdisciplinary teams to further advance our mechanistic understanding of shelterin to a new level. The two aims are: (1) Identify shelterin interactomes and post-translational modifications on shelterin components using chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry analysis (CXMS); (2) Reveal the functional roles of Tpz1 in coordinating shelterin components for telomerase-mediated and recombination-based telomere elongation via analyzing telomere sequences using single molecule, real-time (SMRT) next- generation sequencing technology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Telomeres are closely involved in stem cell differentiation and cancer cell proliferation. The results of this study will lead to new mechanistc models for telomere length regulation and chromosome end protection.

"Epigenomic control of RNA splicing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central objective of this project is to elucidate the roles of epigenetics and chromatin states in RNA splicing regulation. Eukaryotic cells generate astonishing regulatory diversity and as a consequence exceedingly complex phenotypes from a finite set of genes. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing plays an essential role in creating this regulatory diversity by generating multiple RNA isoforms from a single gene. Traditionally, splicing was considered as a ""post-transcriptional"" process, and studies of splicing regulation have largely focused on the roles of cis splicing regulatory elements and their interactions with canonical RNA-binding splicing factors. However, recent studies of eukaryotic epigenomes and transcriptomes have revealed a surprisingly complex picture of splicing regulation shaped by chromatin states and epigenetic marks. Exons are characterized by increased levels of nucleosome positioning, DNA methylation, and certain histone modifications. Many introns are spliced co-transcriptionally when the nascent RNAs are tethered to the chromatin, and changes in the transcription elongation rate or epigenetic marks can influence exon splicing patterns. Despite these exciting findings, many questions about epigenetic regulation of splicing remain unresolved. We propose to systematically investigate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing, by taking advantage of the broad and deep epigenome and transcriptome data generated by the Epigenome Roadmap project. By correlating transcriptome profiles to epigenome profiles across diverse cell types, we aim to address a series of important questions regarding epigenetic regulation of co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional RNA splicing. In three aims, we will investigate epigenome-splicing correlation in diverse tissues and cell types (Aim 1), identify combinatorial chromatin states and long-range interactions associated with splicing (Aim 2), and elucidate how epigenetic determinants affect chromatin-associated splicing (Aim 3). The proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of splicing regulation, and how epigenetic signals influence alternative splicing in normal and diseased cells. In addition, through the proposed work we will develop novel computational methods for linking epigenome signatures to RNA splicing patterns. We anticipate that these tools will be of broad interest and utility to researchers studying epigenome and transcriptome regulation in diverse biological systems.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many human diseases are caused by aberrant pre-mRNA splicing. This project will use extensive epigenome and transcriptome profiles from the Epigenome Roadmap project to elucidate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing.

"Structure based prediction of the interactome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular interactions play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are of particular interest as they are critical in maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Although high-throughput experimental PPI and PRI data is rapidly accumulating, building complete and confident datasets requires multiple replicates of expensive screens. This proposal aims to develop new methods that will significantly advance our efforts at structure-based approaches to better predict PPIs and RPIs and boost confidence in emerging high-throughput (HTP) data with the goal of comprehensive interactome mapping at lower cost. Taken together, these methods will vastly expand our understanding of macromolecular networks. We will continue to devise structure-based methods for protein-protein interaction prediction and branch out to methods for protein-RNA interaction prediction; this represents a major shift from the purely sequence-based approaches that most bioinformatics approaches utilize to predict  We will also build computational frameworks for boosting confidence in HTP protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction datasets using structure-based approaches; these frameworks will provide a comprehensive assessment of in-house and public HTP data, with potential biomedical applications such as heat shock protein-kinase interactions related to development for cancer therapeutics, MAPK6's role in a cancer-related signaling network, and (long non-coding) RNA-protein binding roles in neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we will computationally screen for PPIs and PRIs at the genome scale and expand our Struct2Net webserver to disseminate tools based on our methods and results to the community. An increasing number of HTP interaction datasets are being determined, thus presenting new opportunities to leverage this data in conjunction with structural insights to map binding sites and to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of cellular functions. molecular interactions and will enhance coverage and accuracy of the complete interactome. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods that will significantly increase our confidence in high-throughput data on protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and will reveal fundamental aspects of their functioning, as well as testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. All developed software will be made publicly available.          Biological processes are carried out through thousands of interactions between various types of molecules (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management.

"Wnt Signaling in Colon Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wnt signaling is one of the most common pathways linked to carcinogenesis in the intestine. The transcription factors that mediate Wnt signals are members of the Lymphoid Enhancer Factor/T Cell Factor (LEF/TCF) family. This four-member family is complex in that there are full-length activating forms, truncated dominant negative forms, and alternatively spliced isoforms that modify Wnt target gene recognition. TCF-1 and TCF-4 are the two family members expressed in the epithelial crypt compartment of the intestine. Normally, TCF-1 is expressed as a dominant negative isoform and it counteracts the action of TCF-4 which is expressed as a Wnt-mediating, active isoform. This pattern changes in cancer because TCF-1 expression switches to a full-length, Wnt mediating form. We have discovered a second DNA binding domain in TCF-1 and TCF-4 isoforms called the C-clamp. We have shown that the C-clamp is important for regulating cell proliferation of colon cancer cells. We have also identified Wnts that trigger TCF-1 export in colon cancer cells. Export of TCF-1 leaves the C-clamp form of TCF-4 in the nucleus to mediate aberrant Wnt signaling. Three aims are proposed for this project. First, the extracellular Wnts and intracellular components that direct TCF-1 nuclear export will be defined (Aim1). Second, the biological impact of export will be defined in colon cancer cells and colon cancer initiating 3D cultures (Aim2). Third, the DNA binding specificities and target gene selection of C-clamp forms of TCF-1 and TCF-4 will be defined through genome-wide binding assays (ChIP-Seq), high-throughput protein binding microarrays, and in vitro biochemical analysis (Aim3). The overall goal is to define the mechanisms behind changes in TCF expression in colon carcinogenesis, and to define how extracellular Wnts and DNA binding specificities of TCFs influence aberrant signaling in colon cancer cells with stabilized ?-catenin.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In colon cancer, Wnt signaling is an overactive and strong signal for tumor initiation and progression. Wnt signaling is mediated by the TCF transcription factors and we have discovered their activities and expression to be different in colon cancer versus normal colon tissue. This project investigates basic mechanisms of TCF localization and gene targeting and asks how differences in these attributes contribute to the cancer cell phenotype.

"Unlocking transcript diversity via differential analyses of splice graphs Abstract A most basic difference between cells of the same genotype and different phenotype lies in their transcriptome. Understanding the difference between two transcriptomes in terms of the RNA molecules present in each, or changes in abundance of specific molecules, can offer valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of disease, development, and specialization. High throughput sequencing provides a unique view of the transcriptome in the form of millions or even billions of short reads of nucleotide sequences sampled from the RNA molecules. To date, nearly 1000 such RNA-seq datasets have already been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. Beyond measuring differences in overall expression of genes between samples, there is a critical need to measure differences in expression at the transcript level. Computational tools that can extract significant changes in transcript diversity across populations with RNA-seq are in immediate demand. However, reconstructing the full extent of transcript isoforms from this wealth of data is not a solved problem because of fundamental ambiguities between isoforms at the scale of the short read samples.  We propose a novel approach to the differential analysis of transcriptomes that does not depend on the reconstruction of the full-length transcripts, and yet can accurately pinpoint the variation of transcriptomes. Our techniques are data-driven and applicable to any transcriptome, requiring only a reference genome, and do not depend on a priori gene structure annotations. Our research program builds on our highly sensitive and accurate MapSplice alignment algorithm to construct expression weighted splice graphs (ESG) from RNA-seq datasets. ESGs can be three orders of magnitude smaller in size than current RNA-seq datasets, yet fully represent the substantive biological content of such datasets. The ESG representation supports highly efficient analysis techniques that can directly identify and visualize statistically significant differential transcription between samples. Generalizations of the algorithms are proposed to identify co-regulated splicing patterns that are keys for biological pathway analyses and systems biology analyses.  We have established an ongoing interactive and collaborative research environment among the co-PIs and Co-Is which include the biologists, computer scientists and statistician. The proposed computational methods will be tested and refined using RNA-seq data generated from breast cancer cell lines before being further applied to three well curated RNA-seq datasets on lung cancer pathogenesis, stem cells in leukemia, and equine articular cartilage development and repair (a non-model mammalian organism). Experimental validation of differentially expressed transcript isoforms will both improve the accuracy of our methods, as well as propose novel candidates for alternative isoforms associated with lung cancer,and leukemia diseases, and chondrocyte differentiation.  The software will be open-source and will be developed as a set of components that can be used on their own or integrated into RNA-seq processing workflows. In particular we will integrate the components into the Galaxy cloud computing framework hosted on a local server. As such the methods will be available to researchers worldwide. As components mature they may be installed in other servers worldwide to provide a convenient and secure way to analyze transcriptomes.  Unveiling the dynamics of the transcriptome at modest cost will revolutionize cellular diagnostics and biomedical research. Genome-wide measurement of transcription variants offers the potential for detailed molecular information about cellular identity and function that will greatly expand traditional histological assessment. Cloud-based access to the methods can turn individual laboratories into small genome centers and will enable individual scientists to assess differences among RNA transcriptomes in a matter of days. Our suite of algorithms will enable biomedical researchers to prioritize candidate genes or different gene ontology categories to investigate further for differential transcription and mechanistic importance between experimental conditions. Project Narrative  This project will develop new techniques to compare the transcriptome of different cells, sampled using high-throughput sequencing technology. As the transcriptome consists of the RNA ""instructions"" controlling the cell's functions, differential analysis can provide detailed insight into the difference between healthy and diseased cells, or can be used to more clearly discover the functional differences between, say, liver cells and brain cells.",Unlocking transcript diversity via differential analyses of splice

"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale. First, we will develop a maximum likelihood approach that estimates RNA secondary structure using RNA-seq assays that preferentially sequence single- or double-stranded nucleotides. Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms. In total, our findings will yield tremendous insights into non-coding RNA biology and will substantially impact continued study of these important molecules.           We propose to develop computational methods to study novel non-coding RNA transcripts by leveraging a new duplex RNA sequencing technique.

"An Integrative Approach to Construct a Regulatory Network Effected by TDZs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic disorders. Obesit typically leads to accumulation of dysfunctional white adipose tissue (WAT), which further causes metabolic dysregulation with elevated circulation of fatty acids and increased secretion of proinflammatory adipokines. The discovery of fat burning brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans has raised the exciting possibility of BAT may be targeted as a novel method to treat obesity and metablic diseases. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have a function to convert WAT into a ""brownlike"" state. Beside, TZDs have been used as a remedy for diabetes. But the clinical use of TZDs has been limited because of the safety concerns such as potential cardiovascular risks. Understanding the mechanism will identify efficacious but lower risk drug targets for the metabolic disorders. TZDs act by activatin PPAR? (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ?). However, our understanding about the targets f PPAR? and other cofactors is limited. To understand the role of TZDs and further study the browning effect, we propose to develop a novel algorithm to predict long-range promoter-enhancer interaction and construct a transcriptional network. To predict the long-range interactions, we will employ a machine learning algorithm that uses the enhancer RNA (eRNA) levels and gene transcription levels obtained from global run-on sequencing (GROseq) data. GROseq is a useful dataset to predict long-range interactions, as the eRNA levels highly correlate with the gene transcription level. Applyingthe obtained interactions to the known binding sites of TFs including PPAR?, GR, C/EBP, SMRT, and RXR, we will construct a comprehensive TF-gene network. The predicted interaction provides a useful environment to study gene regulation of TZDs. We will study how the distance, relative position, an the combination of multiple TF binding sites affect gene expression. We will also investigate the browning effects by TZDs by including BAT-specific TF binding data in the network. The transcriptioal rule of the BAT-specific binding information, in combination with other TFs, will be analyzed from he TF-gene network. As a whole, these studies use an innovative and creative approach to integrate various types of data to study gene regulation of TZDs. By reprocessing complex genomic datasets ino a comprehensive regulatory network, the proposed algorithm provides a unique view in analyzing the regulatory rules of the browning effect, which will greatly enhance our understanding about the gen regulation of TZDs and identify potential therapeutic targets for diabetes.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A noble algorithm is developed to reprocess and integrate various types of data in a regulatory network to the study of the browning effect by thiazolidinedione (TZD).

"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR CERVICAL CANCER     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary It is estimated that there will be about 12,340 new cases of cervical cancer and those 4,030 women will die of this disease this year in the United States (American Cancer Society). Worldwide, invasive cervical cancer is an even greater problem and is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. A method to accurately predict cervical cancer outcome prior to standard therapy would be critical for the early identification of patients with high risk of treatment failures. For these high-risk patients modified therapy could potentially be applied for improved patient survival. However, traditional clinic pathologic features, such as tumor grade and stage, have limited prognostic values in cervical cancer. Thus, new methods need to be developed for improved prognostic performance. In this proposed research, we will test the hypothesis that the expression signature of multiple selected microRNAs can reliably predict the outcome of cervical cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a newly discovered family of small non- coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers to predict cancer therapy outcomes. However, the prognostic value of miRNAs in cervical cancer has not been investigated. The major goal of this research is to build a miRNA-based model to robustly predict cervical cancer outcome. Our preliminary analysis has identified two miRNAs that are predictive of cervical cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all cervix-related miRNAs in a large number of cervical tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of cervical cancer.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RELEVANCE Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide, leading to about 300,000 deaths each year.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions PROJECT SUMMARY  Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would  provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular  receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models  will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+- binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction  domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high-  throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity.

"An Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central dogma of molecular biology has undergone a significant revision where RNAs have emerged as important regulators of cell activity. Astonishingly, as much as 80% of human DNA is transcribed into RNA as recently reported by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium. New classes of RNA are being identified including many which are non-protein coding (ncRNA). Nonetheless ncRNAs are involved in regulating cellular activity. Deciphering the structure-function relationship of these RNAs is of immediate importance as ncRNAs have now been implicated in a variety of diseases including myotonic dystrophy type 1, prostate cancer, spinal muscular atrophy, and Huntington's disease-like 2. Traditional approaches to determine high-resolution RNA 3D structures have proven to be prohibitively time consuming and expensive. Nymirum has developed an Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System that is faster, cheaper, and more robust than current approaches. This System will be commercialized for use by the drug industry and academic researchers in their quest to understand and treat human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RNA 3D structure and function information is critical to understanding basic cell function, delineating dysfunctional RNA contribution to human disease, and finding new drugs to treat diseases caused by dysfunctional RNAs.

"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control.

These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks  Project summary It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases.  Public Health Relevance Statement RNA regulation is critical for the diversification of mammalian gene expression, organism complexity, and human diseases. The proposed study is to investigate the fundamentals of neuronal RNA complexity at the systems level, using a combination of high-throughput experimental technologies and novel integrative computational methods.",An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks,8601105,R00GM095713,"['Age ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environment ', ' Exons ', ' Foxes ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' genetically engineered ', ' Recombinant DNA Technology ', ' Genetic Engineering Molecular Biology ', ' Genetic Engineering Biotechnology ', ' Genetic Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Nucleotides ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Null Mouse ', ' Knock-out Mice ', ' Knockout Mice ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' high throughput technology ', ' Genomics ', ' RNA Polyadenylation ', ' Polyadenylation ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' structural genomics ', ' mRNA Stability ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Small RNA ', ' Data ', ' RNA-Protein Interaction ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' mRNA Export ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Knockout ', ' Knock-out ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' computational studies ', ' computer studies ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' biochemical model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' markov model ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' functional outcomes ', ' combinatorial ', ' human disease ', ' comparative ', ' public health relevance ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' RNA-seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' ']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2014,249000,0.12201239244653816

Furthermore, the data will be utilized for subsequent generation of cellular network signatures in the Data Analysis Aim. Sub aim 1.1 will be generate 10 different phenotypic endpoints for 30 cell lines grown on 3,060 MEs.

Each of the 50 ME conditions will be re-tested with the same endpoints at a second site using MEMA technology to provide independent validation of the primary results. At the same time, the cells will be tested using the 50 ME conditions on a second set of arrays designed to model the elastic modulus of human tissues to determine the effects on phenotypes of the matrix stiffness. From the 50 conditions tested in the validation aims, 30 of the most concordant between the primary and validation sites will be selected annually for analysis by Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) aim 1.2.B and RNA expression analysis (aim I.2.C.). The RPPA aim will produce data using 500 validated antibodies against proteins and phosphoproteins in key signaling pathways under each of the ME perturbations. The RNA expression analysis will examine 1000 key genes using Luminex bead technology developed by the LINCS group at the Broad Institute, who will perform the same analysis for us using RNA prepared from each of the cell lines grown under the ME conditions. In total, the RPPA and RNA expression analysis will generate data for 150 different ME conditions under 2 different elastic moduli.

"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale. First, we will develop a maximum likelihood approach that estimates RNA secondary structure using RNA-seq assays that preferentially sequence single- or double-stranded nucleotides. Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms. In total, our findings will yield tremendous insights into non-coding RNA biology and will substantially impact continued study of these important molecules. We propose to develop computational methods to study novel non-coding RNA transcripts by leveraging a new duplex RNA sequencing technique. Our first objective is to develop a maximum likelihood algorithm that estimates secondary structure using double-stranded or single-stranded RNA sequencing.

Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain. Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders. This proposal seeks to establish the interactions among selected RBPs and their functional RNA elements in mammalian neurons. This will be a crucial first step in elucidating the RNA networks regulated by these RBPs in the brain.",Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain,8790775,R01NS075449,"['Affect ', ' Alternative RNA

"Structure based prediction of the interactome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular interactions play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are of particular interest as they are critical in maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Although high-throughput experimental PPI and PRI data is rapidly accumulating, building complete and confident datasets requires multiple replicates of expensive screens. This proposal aims to develop new methods that will significantly advance our efforts at structure-based approaches to better predict PPIs and RPIs and boost confidence in emerging high-throughput (HTP) data with the goal of comprehensive interactome mapping at lower cost. Taken together, these methods will vastly expand our understanding of macromolecular networks. We will continue to devise structure-based methods for protein-protein interaction prediction and branch out to methods for protein-RNA interaction prediction; this represents a major shift from the purely sequence-based approaches that most bioinformatics approaches utilize to predict  We will also build computational frameworks for boosting confidence in HTP protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction datasets using structure-based approaches; these frameworks will provide a comprehensive assessment of in-house and public HTP data, with potential biomedical applications such as heat shock protein-kinase interactions related to development for cancer therapeutics, MAPK6's role in a cancer-related signaling network, and (long non-coding) RNA-protein binding roles in neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we will computationally screen for PPIs and PRIs at the genome scale and expand our Struct2Net webserver to disseminate tools based on our methods and results to the community. An increasing number of HTP interaction datasets are being determined, thus presenting new opportunities to leverage this data in conjunction with structural insights to map binding sites and to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of cellular functions. molecular interactions and will enhance coverage and accuracy of the complete interactome. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods that will significantly increase our confidence in high-throughput data on protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and will reveal fundamental aspects of their functioning, as well as testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. All developed software will be made publicly available. Biological processes are carried out through thousands of interactions between various types of molecules (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management.

"miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid in CFS ABSTRACT: ""miRNA in CSF of CFS""  Exosomes are membrane-bound microvesicles (Figure 1) Figure 1. Exosome formation. that are released from cells and mediate cell-to-cell transfer of short (22-25 nucleotides), noncoding, message inhibitory RNAs (miRNAs), genomic DNA, proteins and membrane lipids. The exosome surface has CD9, CD63, CD81 and other ligands that bind to integrins and other receptors on endothelium and other target cells. The exosome and target cell membranes fuse and miRNAs are released into the cytoplasm. Proinflammatory roles include transport of transforming growth factor-¿, and secretion of nitric oxide, reactive oxidant species, IL-1¿ and IL-18. Exosomes may act as circulating hormone- or virus-like inflammasomes to transmit injury signals in organs such as the brain. Pre- and post- synaptic neurons and glia have active exosome systems that contribute to neural plasticity, but that also transport amyloid, tau and prion proteins and rabies viruses.  miRNAs are products of short genes that are scattered throughout the genome. They bind to precise sequences in selected mRNAs. The binding prevents translation of the target mRNA and prevents protein synthesis. Over 1500 human miRNAs regulate about 50% of known proteins in cell-specific fashion. Exosome miRNAs may initiate, expand, and maintain dysfunctional phenotypes by preventing the expression of critical proteins in targeted cells. miRNAs may be biomarkers of aging, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, cardiomyopathy, and other diseases. In human synapses, ten miRNAs regulate 80% of the 242 presynaptic and 304 post-synaptic proteins. Analysis of pooled specimens of cerebrospinal fluid by next generation RNA sequencing (NGS) identified 133 unique miRNAs. However, NGS is currently inefficient for studying the patterns of miRNAs from individual subjects. This is because the yield of miRNA is low so that >2 ml of cerebrospinal fluid per individual subject may be needed, or the samples pooled between subjects. Therefore, we propose to use quantitative PCR of miRNAs for this cerebrospinal fluid study.  Exosome proteins include RNA-binding heat shock and other cytoplasmic proteins; cell surface receptors such as CD9, CD63, CD81 and HLA-G; and other transmembrane proteins. These may reveal the nature of the cell type that secreted the exosome.  Preliminary Data. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Gulf War Illness (GWI) veterans who also met CFS criteria have demonstrated significant, specific, central nervous system dysfunction. GWI subsets have been identified. miRNA contributes to these GWI subsets. This suggests objectively defined CFS phenotypes may also be discovered and discriminated by miRNA patterns (""biosignatures""). Exosome RNA, protein, and lipid components can be purified from fresh and -80¿C frozen CSF. NGS was performed on cerebrospinal fluid from sedentary control (SC) subjects at rest and two subsets of GWI subjects defined by their magnetic resonance imaging and responses to exercise. The 3 groups had unique miRNA patterns. MIR22 had equivalent levels in SC and the Stress Test Associated Reversible Tachycardia (START) and Stress Test Originated Phantom Perception (STOPP) specimens. Eleven miRNAs were found in only in SC. START had 7 unique miRNAs, and STOPP had 2 unique miRNAs. These patterns may provide insights into mechanisms of exercise-induced malaise, pain, autonomic and cognitive dysfunction as well as being phenotype - specific biomarkers. These data from GWI with CFS suggest phenotypes and specific miRNAs biomarkers in CFS.  Objective. Like GWI, CFS is a heterogenous disorder with latent phenotypes that can be identified from specific combinations of miRNAs expressed in cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. This unique hypothesis presumes that subsets of CFS have specific patterns of brain cell miRNAs. Distinct patterns of exosome miRNA and protein expression will discern CFS subjects from SC, and provide biomarkers for diagnosis. Exosome proteins may identify presynaptic, postsynaptic, microglial, astrocyte, or oligodendrocyte cells of origin. Drugs that target exosome biology may be beneficial in CFS or selected CFS phenotypes.  SPECIFIC AIM 1: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes. Use quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q- PCR) to identify the patterns of 380 miRNAs expressed in individual CFS and SC subjects before and after exercise. Determine patterns that discriminate CFS from SC, and identify latent phenotypes of CFS subjects. Characterize the miRNA-regulated proteins and infer the consequences for CFS brain biology.  SPECIFIC AIM 2: Isolate cerebrospinal fluid exosomes and purify their proteins. Perform mass spectrometry for proteomic identification of exosome proteins. Determine the potential sources of the exosomes based on these proteins, and potential target cells based on the nature of the exosome surface receptors, transmembrane and intravesicular proteins. PROJECT NARRATIVE   miRNAs (messenger inhibiting RNA) in cerebrospinal fluid from Gulf War Illness subjects who also  met CFS criteria was significantly altered compared to sedentary control subjects. Two GWI/CFS  phenotypes were identified. This suggests miRNA may provide objective insights into CFS  pathophysiology, biomarkers, and potential mechanisms and future treatments. The miRNAs are  contained in lipid-bound vesicles, or exosomes. We will assay the proteins in the exosomes to  identify the cells of origin and potential targets for these enveloped virus-like microvesicles.",miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid in

"An Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central dogma of molecular biology has undergone a significant revision where RNAs have emerged as important regulators of cell activity.

"Rational design of small interfering RNA for genome-wide target knockdown ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  RNA interference (RNAi) is a small RNA-guided gene silencing process within living cells. The RNAi technique is widely used in both biological research and clinical applications because it has the ability to knockdown essentially any gene of interest. However, one major unresolved issue in RNAi studies is non-specific gene silencing. It is well known that, in addition to the single intended gene target, many unintended targets are also simultaneously silenced. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new methods for improving RNAi specificity. RNAi specificity and potency are determined by the small interfering RNA (siRNA) in the silencing complex. We propose the hypothesis that gene silencing specificity can be significantly improved with rational siRNA design. We have previously developed a machine learning algorithm for the design of widely-distributed commercial siRNAs. Based on this commercial success, we propose to further develop a new method for genome-wide design of next-generation siRNAs with significantly reduced off-target effects. The new design method will lay a solid foundation for further commercial development of siRNA products that can be used in a variety of RNAi-based applications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  RNA interference (RNAi) is a small RNA-guided gene silencing process within living cells. RNAi has many diverse applications as it can suppress almost any human genes by recognizing the gene sequence.

"Wnt Signaling in Colon Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wnt signaling is one of the most common pathways linked to carcinogenesis in the intestine. The transcription factors that mediate Wnt signals are members of the Lymphoid Enhancer Factor/T Cell Factor (LEF/TCF) family. This four-member family is complex in that there are full-length activating forms, truncated dominant negative forms, and alternatively spliced isoforms that modify Wnt target gene recognition. TCF-1 and TCF-4 are the two family members expressed in the epithelial crypt compartment of the intestine. Normally, TCF-1 is expressed as a dominant negative isoform and it counteracts the action of TCF-4 which is expressed as a Wnt-mediating, active isoform. This pattern changes in cancer because TCF-1 expression switches to a full-length, Wnt mediating form. We have discovered a second DNA binding domain in TCF-1 and TCF-4 isoforms called the C-clamp. We have shown that the C-clamp is important for regulating cell proliferation of colon cancer cells. We have also identified Wnts that trigger TCF-1 export in colon cancer cells. Export of TCF-1 leaves the C-clamp form of TCF-4 in the nucleus to mediate aberrant Wnt signaling. Three aims are proposed for this project. First, the extracellular Wnts and intracellular components that direct TCF-1 nuclear export will be defined (Aim1). Second, the biological impact of export will be defined in colon cancer cells and colon cancer initiating 3D cultures (Aim2). Third, the DNA binding specificities and target gene selection of C-clamp forms of TCF-1 and TCF-4 will be defined through genome-wide binding assays (ChIP-Seq), high-throughput protein binding microarrays, and in vitro biochemical analysis (Aim3). The overall goal is to define the mechanisms behind changes in TCF expression in colon carcinogenesis, and to define how extracellular Wnts and DNA binding specificities of TCFs influence aberrant signaling in colon cancer cells with stabilized ß-catenin. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In colon cancer, Wnt signaling is an overactive and strong signal for tumor initiation and progression. Wnt signaling is mediated by the TCF transcription factors and we have discovered their activities and expression to be different in colon cancer versus normal colon tissue. This project investigates basic mechanisms of TCF localization and gene targeting and asks how differences in these attributes contribute to the cancer cell phenotype.",Wnt Signaling in Colon Cancer,8857373,R01CA108697,"['Affect ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Colon ', ' Elements ', ' Epithelium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Intestines ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Ligands ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Protein Binding ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' matrigel ', ' Consensus Sequence ', ' Family member ', ' Mediating ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' β-catenin ', ' PRO2286 ', ' Cadherin-Associated Protein, Beta 1 (88kD) ', ' CUL-2 ', ' Beta-1 Catenin ', ' Beta Cadherin-Associated Protein ', ' beta catenin ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Epithelial ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' extracellular ', ' Nuclear ', ' Autocrine Systems ', ' autocrine ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Cellular Proliferation ', ' Cell Multiplication ', ' Cell Growth in Number ', ' Cell Proliferation ', ' paracrine ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' tumor initiation ', ' Response Elements ', ' expectation ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' gene expression microarray ', ' GeneChip ', ' Gene Expression Chip ', ' Gene Chips ', ' Nuclear Export ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' DNA Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Normal Cell ', ' TCF7L2 ', ' TCF4 ', ' TCF-4 ', ' TCF7L2 gene ', ' Length ', ' microarray technology ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' DNA-Binding Protein Motifs ', ' DNA Binding Domain ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Dominant-Negative Mutant ', ' Dominant Negative ', ' Antimorphic mutation ', ' Dominant-Negative Mutation ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Cell Cycle Progression ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' T Cell Factor ', ' Lymphoid Enhancer Factor ', ' LEF Transcription Factor ', ' TCF Transcription Factor ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cancer genome ', ' human disease ', ' colon carcinogenesis ', ' colon cancer cell line ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2015,286517,0.05048958660354737
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR CERVICAL CANCER DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary It is estimated that there will be about 12,340 new cases of cervical cancer and those 4,030 women will die of this disease this year in the United States (American Cancer Society). Worldwide, invasive cervical cancer is an even greater problem and is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. A method to accurately predict cervical cancer outcome prior to standard therapy would be critical for the early identification of patients with high risk of treatment failures. For these high-risk patients modified therapy could potentially be applied for improved patient survival. However, traditional clinic pathologic features, such as tumor grade and stage, have limited prognostic values in cervical cancer. Thus, new methods need to be developed for improved prognostic performance. In this proposed research, we will test the hypothesis that the expression signature of multiple selected microRNAs can reliably predict the outcome of cervical cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a newly discovered family of small non- coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers to predict cancer therapy outcomes. However, the prognostic value of miRNAs in cervical cancer has not been investigated. The major goal of this research is to build a miRNA-based model to robustly predict cervical cancer outcome. Our preliminary analysis has identified two miRNAs that are predictive of cervical cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all cervix-related miRNAs in a large number of cervical tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of cervical cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RELEVANCE Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide, leading to about 300,000 deaths each year.

"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks Project summary It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases. Public Health Relevance Statement RNA regulation is critical for the diversification of mammalian gene expression, organism complexity, and human diseases.

"Epigenomic control of RNA splicing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central objective of this project is to elucidate the roles of epigenetics and chromatin states in RNA splicing regulation. Eukaryotic cells generate astonishing regulatory diversity and as a consequence exceedingly complex phenotypes from a finite set of genes. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing plays an essential role in creating this regulatory diversity by generating multiple RNA isoforms from a single gene. Traditionally, splicing was considered as a ""post-transcriptional"" process, and studies of splicing regulation have largely focused on the roles of cis splicing regulatory elements and their interactions with canonical RNA-binding splicing factors. However, recent studies of eukaryotic epigenomes and transcriptomes have revealed a surprisingly complex picture of splicing regulation shaped by chromatin states and epigenetic marks. Exons are characterized by increased levels of nucleosome positioning, DNA methylation, and certain histone modifications. Many introns are spliced co-transcriptionally when the nascent RNAs are tethered to the chromatin, and changes in the transcription elongation rate or epigenetic marks can influence exon splicing patterns. Despite these exciting findings, many questions about epigenetic regulation of splicing remain unresolved. We propose to systematically investigate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing, by taking advantage of the broad and deep epigenome and transcriptome data generated by the Epigenome Roadmap project. By correlating transcriptome profiles to epigenome profiles across diverse cell types, we aim to address a series of important questions regarding epigenetic regulation of co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional RNA splicing. In three aims, we will investigate epigenome-splicing correlation in diverse tissues and cell types (Aim 1), identify combinatorial chromatin states and long-range interactions associated with splicing (Aim 2), and elucidate how epigenetic determinants affect chromatin-associated splicing (Aim 3). The proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of splicing regulation, and how epigenetic signals influence alternative splicing in normal and diseased cells. In addition, through the proposed work we will develop novel computational methods for linking epigenome signatures to RNA splicing patterns. We anticipate that these tools will be of broad interest and utility to researchers studying epigenome and transcriptome regulation in diverse biological systems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many human diseases are caused by aberrant pre-mRNA splicing. This project will use extensive epigenome and transcriptome profiles from the Epigenome Roadmap project to elucidate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing.

"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale. First, we will develop a maximum likelihood approach that estimates RNA secondary structure using RNA-seq assays that preferentially sequence single- or double-stranded nucleotides. Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms. In total, our findings will yield tremendous insights into non-coding RNA biology and will substantially impact continued study of these important molecules. We propose to develop computational methods to study novel non-coding RNA transcripts by leveraging a new duplex RNA sequencing technique.

"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells. Control of cell states, such as in maintenance of pluripotency by stem cells or differentiation into defined cell lineages, holds promise for regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. These cell fate programs are initiated by `pioneer factors' that recognize their genomic target sites and induce hierarchies of gene regulatory programs. We will identify human pioneer factors and characterize their regulatory interactions.",Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA,9206289,R21HG009268,"['Affect ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cataloging ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Thymonuclease ', ' Pancreatic DNase ', ' DNase I ', ' DNA Endonuclease ', ' Deoxyribonuclease I ', ' Engineering ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stem cells ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' Ensure ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' Therapeutic ', ' dsDNA ', ' Double-Stranded DNA ', ' ds-DNA ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' cell type ', ' technology development ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' gatekeeper ', ' Gatekeeping ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' high throughput technology ', ' Genomics ', ' gel shift assay ', ' Mobility Shift Assay ', ' Bandshift Mobility Assay ', ' Band Shift Mobility Assay ', ' Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay ', ' histone modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' DNase-I Footprinting ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vivo ', ' Transcript ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Cancer stem cell ', ' malignant stem cell ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' pluripotency ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2016,221875,0.02730841031782874
"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.            ",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9106490,R01GM051946,"['Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dissection ', ' fruit fly ', ' Drosophila ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Elements ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Developmental Gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Logic ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Repression ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Zinc Fingers ', ' Zinc Finger Motifs ', ' Zinc Finger Domain ', ' Enhancers ', ' Mediating ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Protein Domains ', ' Peptide Domain ', ' Tertiary Protein Structure ', ' base ', ' cofactor ', ' Anterior ', ' Site ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Measurement ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Homeotic Proteins ', ' Homeoproteins ', ' Homeodomain Family Protein ', ' Homeobox Proteins ', ' Homeobox Family Protein ', ' Homeo Domain Proteins ', ' Homeodomain Proteins ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Body Pattern Specification ', ' Body Pattern Formation ', ' Body Patterning ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' transgenic ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' Transact ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Eukaryote ', ' Eukaryota ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' single molecule ', ' Gene Position ', ' Gene Arrangement ', ' Gene Order ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' DNA Binding ', ' Pattern Formation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Defect ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' in vivo ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Flies ', ' fly ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' loss of function mutation ', ' morphogens ', ' public health relevance ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR method ', ' ']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,360706,0.05552747866471618

"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators.

"Rational design of small interfering RNA for genome-wide target knockdown ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  RNA interference (RNAi) is a small RNA-guided gene silencing process within living cells. The RNAi technique is widely used in both biological research and clinical applications because it has the ability to knockdown essentially any gene of interest. However, one major unresolved issue in RNAi studies is non-specific gene silencing. It is well known that, in addition to the single intended gene target, many unintended targets are also simultaneously silenced. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new methods for improving RNAi specificity. RNAi specificity and potency are determined by the small interfering RNA (siRNA) in the silencing complex. We propose the hypothesis that gene silencing specificity can be significantly improved with rational siRNA design. We have previously developed a machine learning algorithm for the design of widely-distributed commercial siRNAs. Based on this commercial success, we propose to further develop a new method for genome-wide design of next-generation siRNAs with significantly reduced off-target effects. The new design method will lay a solid foundation for further commercial development of siRNA products that can be used in a variety of RNAi-based applications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  RNA interference (RNAi) is a small RNA-guided gene silencing process within living cells. RNAi has many diverse applications as it can suppress almost any human genes by recognizing the gene sequence. We propose to remove a major hurdle in RNAi studies by genome-wide design of siRNAs with significantly improved gene silencing specificity.",Rational design of small interfering RNA for genome-wide target knockdown,9146385,R41HG008567,"['Algorithms ', ' Cataloging ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Experimental Models ', ' RNA Sequence Analyses ', ' RNA Sequence Analysis ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Solid ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Therapeutic ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Catalogs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Gene Inactivation ', ' Gene Silencing ', ' Modeling ', ' siRNA ', ' Short interfering RNA ', ' Small Interfering RNA ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNA Interference ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Small RNA ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' biological research ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' public health relevance ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' High-Throughput RNA Sequencing ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' RNA interference screen ', ' RNAi-based screen ', ' RNAi screen ', ' ']",NHGRI,"NAWGEN, LLC",R41,2016,332925,0.08030271948068991
"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9008644,R01GM117325,"['abstracting ', ' Algorithms ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cataloging ', ' Catalysis ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' electron transfer ', ' Electron Transport ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Gases ', ' Ions ', ' Mg element ', ' Magnesium ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Metals ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Names ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' Nucleotides ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Play ', ' Polyphosphates ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Work ', ' Zinc ', ' Zn element ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' protein folding ', ' base ', ' density ', ' macromolecule ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Fe element ', ' Iron ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Heavy Metals ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Catalogs ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' electron density ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' drug discovery ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Metal Ion Binding ', ' Enzymatic Reaction ', ' Biochemical Reaction ', ' biophysical mechanism ', ' Biophysical Process ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Metal Binding Site ', ' Retrieval ', ' Structural Biologist ', ' Collection ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' To specify ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' comparative ', ' database structure ', ' data base structure ', ' model building ', ' support tools ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2016,343124,0.11321787346216809
"Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs as Novel Biomarkers for Heterogeneous Glioblastomas PROJECT SUMMARY  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant form of brain tumors with more than 18,000 newly diagnosed patients and 13,000 deaths annually in the United States. The prognosis for GBM remains dismal with a median survival time of GBM patients of 14 to 16 months after diagnosis. A hallmark of malignant GBM is their high heterogeneity within the tumors. This unique characteristic manifests to molecular subtypes of GBM that display unique patterns of pathogenesis, biology, and prognosis. While specific molecular markers are of value in clinical care (e.g., IDH1/2 mutations, 1p/19q co-deletion), significant improvement in prognostic stratification and targeted therapeutics are urgently needed. With the ultimate goal of realizing the full potential of personalized and precision medicine, we propose to interrogate long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in a cohort of clinical GBM specimens. LncRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that have emerged as critical modulators in various cellular processes through gene regulation. Previous studies including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), though limited by their profiling technique not designed for non-coding RNAs, have suggested that lncRNAs are abundant in human cancers and are highly cancer-type-specific. In particular, lncRNAs have been implicated in brain function and glioma development. Specifically, in this exploratory project, we will apply the Ribo-Zero-based transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) to comprehensively characterize lncRNAs in 100 clinical GBM samples that have been collected at the Northwestern University Brain Tumor Tissue Bank (Aim 1a). In contrast to the oligo(dT)-based RNA-seq that was used by previous studies, including TCGA, the Ribo-Zero-based technique is optimized for non-coding RNA transcripts, thus offering a great advantage for profiling all potentially functional lncRNAs in GBM. Notably, a novel detection algorithm based on machine learning will be developed to provide a more flexible and universal framework of lncRNA detection using RNA-seq. Though restricted to those lncRNAs shared between our GBM data and the oligo(dT)-based TCGA, we will evaluate the tissue-specificity of lncRNAs detected in GBM using TCGA data on several solid tumors (Aim 1b). After characterizing the landscape of lncRNAs in GBM, we will evaluate whether lncRNAs are associated with the clinical outcomes of GBM patients, and evaluate the feasibility of integrating lncRNAs and gene-level transcripts into a prognostic tool (Aim 2a). This proposal will enable us to employ these novel biomarkers for the prognosis of GBM as well as future functional studies. In addition, we will utilize co-expression network analysis to assign functions to the detected lncRNAs in GBM. An integrated, internet-based catalog will be constructed to provide a resource of lncRNAs in GBM that will benefit the general research community in this new area (Aim 2b). Finally, the PIs have assembled an outstanding research team with significant achievements in relevant research areas and complimentary expertise, therefore ensuring the success of this multidisciplinary and highly innovative project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This work seeks to understand whether long non-coding RNAs implicate in the prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a form of malignant brain tumors. By characterizing these novel gene regulatory molecules in GBM, we expect to identify novel biomarkers that can be used as a prognostic tool for patients with GBM.

"An Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central dogma of molecular biology has undergone a significant revision where RNAs have emerged as important regulators of cell activity.

"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain. Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders. This proposal seeks to establish the interactions among selected RBPs and their functional RNA elements in mammalian neurons.

"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach.

"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is entitled “Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning.” A number of in- terrelated computational methods for making predictions about the biological behavior of small molecules have been the subject of development within the Jain Laboratory for over twenty years. These share a common strat- egy that considers molecular interactions at their surface interface, where proteins and ligands actually interact. These methods yield measurements of similarity between small molecules or between protein binding pockets. They also yield measurements of the complementarity of a small molecule to a protein binding site (the molecular docking problem). A generalization of these concepts makes possible the construction of a virtual binding site for quantitative activity prediction purely from data about the biological activities of a set of small molecules.  The goals of the proposed work include further improving the accuracy and breadth of applicability of the binding site modeling approach. The primary application of the approach is to guide optimization of leads within medicinal chemistry projects, and to quantify potential off-target effects during pre-clinical drug discovery.  A critical focus of the work will be in data and software dissemination, in order to accelerate the efficient development of targeted therapies. In addition to methods development, the proposed work will involve broad application of these state-of-the-art predictive modeling methods. The proposed work will proceed with the col- laborative input of our pharmaceutical industry colleagues, who have specialized knowledge and data sets that are vital for cutting-edge work in computer-aided drug design.  The expected results include more efficient lead optimization (fewer compounds to reach desired biological pa- rameters), truly effective scaffold replacement (to move away from a molecular series with biological limitations), and improved computational predictions of off-target effects during pre-clinical drug design. Project Narrative This project seeks to refine an integrated platform for physically realistic prediction of ligand binding affinities using multiple methods that span small molecule molecular similarity, molecular docking, and protein binding site similarity. These tools will provide predictive modeling unrestrained by scaffold congruence between what is known and what is to be predicted. Prediction of bioactive molecular poses and activities to guide lead optimiza- tion and to quantify off-target liability effects are applications of the effort, and data and software will be made widely available to academic and industrial research groups.",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,9309936,R01GM101689,"['Behavior ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Charge ', ' Pharmaceutic Chemistry ', ' Medicinal Chemistry ', ' Pharmaceutical Chemistry ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmaceutical Industry ', ' Pharmaceutic Industry ', ' Drug Industry ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' H-bond ', ' Hydrogen Bonding ', ' Industrialization ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Molecular Probes ', ' Physics ', ' Protein Conformation ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Surface ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Chemicals ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' scaffold ', ' scaffolding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Electrostatics ', ' Knowledge ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' physical model ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' drug discovery ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Industry Collaboration ', ' Industry Collaborators ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Docking ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' virtual ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' treatment charges ', ' charges for treatment ', ' treatment fees ', ' blind ', ' combinatorial ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Formulation ', ' Structural Protein ', ' ']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2017,310202,0.03535836793375995
"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9276695,R01GM051946,"['Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dissection ', ' fruit fly ', ' Drosophila ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Elements ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Logic ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Repression ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Zinc Finger Motifs ', ' Zinc Finger Domain ', ' Zinc Fingers ', ' Enhancers ', ' Mediating ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' Protein Domains ', ' Peptide Domain ', ' Tertiary Protein Structure ', ' GBF protein ', ' GBF bZIP protein ', ' bZIP Protein ', ' base ', ' cofactor ', ' Anterior ', ' Site ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Measurement ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Homeotic Proteins ', ' Homeoproteins ', ' Homeodomain Family Protein ', ' Homeobox Proteins ', ' Homeobox Family Protein ', ' Homeo Domain Proteins ', ' Homeodomain Proteins ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Body Patterning ', ' Body Pattern Specification ', ' Body Pattern Formation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' transgenic ', ' Transact ', ' Eukaryota ', ' Eukaryote ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' single molecule ', ' Gene Order ', ' Gene Position ', ' Gene Arrangement ', ' DNA Binding ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' Pattern Formation ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Defect ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' in vivo ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Flies ', ' fly ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' loss of function mutation ', ' morphogens ', ' public health relevance ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR method ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,356861,0.05552747866471618
"Systematic, Genome-Scale Functional Characterization of Conserved smORFs PROJECT SUMMARY Short peptides (10-100aa) are important regulators of physiology, development and metabolism, however their detection is difficult due to size and abundance. A stunning 30% of annotated human smORF genes include disease-associated variants mapped within exons, compared to 15% of human genes in general. Further, many smORFs are conserved across the entire metazoan phylogeny from invertebrates to vertebrates including man. These ultra-conserved functional smORF genes we call the Conserved smORF Catalog or CSC. These genes have been conserved across more than 500myr of evolution, and yet we know almost nothing at all about their functions. Due to a century of genetic analysis, the genome of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster has the most complete functional annotation among metazoans. Functional annotations derived from Drosophila have been instrumental in hypothesis-based drug development for more than thirty years, and more recently have made possible the biological interpretation of hundreds of SNPs detected in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Hence, functional annotations derived in fly for conserved genes are transferable to human and are of direct clinical relevance. Remarkably, less than 10% of smORFs in Drosophila have been studied functionally, or experimentally verified as generating peptides. A combination of genome engineering, computational, molecular, and functional studies will be used to systematically and comprehensively characterize the CSC, representing the first genome-scale characterization of smORFs in any organism providing a wealth of information on the biological functions of this poorly studied class of proteins. In total, we will characterize and functionally annotate ~400 conserved smORFs using CRISPR knockout followed by phenotyping and rescue assays. We will assess the phenotypes of the mutants, measuring viability, morphology, fecundity and fertility, lifespan, metabolism (sugar and lipid levels), and a number of behavioral phenotypes. For smORFs with robust phenotypes, we will then attempt to rescue a subset of these mutants in three ways: first, by inserting the whole deleted RNA; second, with a version of the RNA with the smORF(s) removed by the addition a stop codon; and lastly, using a micro- construct containing only the smORF and the endogenous promoter. We will generate direct evidence for translation using tagged expression analysis and targeted MS/MS to scan for predicted polypeptides in the whole embryo and tissue dissection samples. In addition to validating the existence of the predicted molecules, this dataset will provide a foundational gold standard for further development of tools for the computational prediction of functional micropeptides. These studies are directed toward the understanding of basic life processes and lay the foundation for promoting better human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE As a public resource, our studies will combine genome-scale phenotyping with detailed functional characterization that will assess the effects of evolutionary conserved small open reading frames (smORFs) on animal viability, development, fecundity, metabolism, longevity and behavior. We will apply state-of-the art methods in Ribosomal profiling, CRISPR genome engineering and targeted mass spectrometry together with the development of new computational tools and analyses to generate a foundational gold standard dataset for the study of smORFs and the prediction of functional smORFs in genome annotation. Many of the genes encoding these molecules have been found to play important roles in human diseases such as neurodegeneration, developmental disorders and cancer.","Systematic, Genome-Scale

"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9381186,R01DE026471,"['driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Methods ', ' Oropharyngeal Neoplasms ', ' oral pharyngeal neoplasm ', ' Oropharynx Tumor ', ' Oropharynx Neoplasms ', ' Oropharyngeal Tumor ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' malignant oropharynx tumor ', ' Oropharynx Carcinoma ', ' Oropharynx Cancer ', ' Oropharyngeal Carcinoma ', ' Oropharyngeal Cancer ', ' Oropharnyx Cancers ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Tumor ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Neoplasm ', ' malignant oropharynx neoplasm ', ' therapy failure ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Oropharyngeal ', ' oral pharyngeal ', ' Oropharynxs ', ' Oropharynx ', ' Reporting ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Institution ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Prognosis ', ' Validation ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' prospective ', ' Oncogenic ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' screening ', ' Patient risk ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' patient biomarkers ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subtypes ', ' microRNA biomarkers ', ' microRNA markers ', ' miRNA markers ', ' miRNA biomarkers ', ' prognostic assays ', ' prognostic test ', ' ']",NIDCR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,362188,0.0411748111565834
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms.

First, it seeks to shift medical practice toward more personalized treatments, by applying innovative methods to analyze and integrate DNA, RNA and protein data generated by a large network of GDAN researchers in a miRNA-centric framework. Analyses will identify cancer subtypes, and individual patients within a subtype, in which alterations in the expression of certain miRNAs influence cancer pathogenesis and drug response. Second, the proposed research seeks to shift cancer genomics research by allowing a diverse group of cancer researchers to flexibly access and use the project’s cancer genomics data, and microRNA-centric results and methods, through a cloud computing framework. The proposed research has three specific aims: 1) Build a computational pipeline for processing and analysis of miRNA data, 2) Elucidate the regulation of and by miRNAs through integrative analysis, and 3) Delineate the role of miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment using predictive modeling. Research design and methods: 1) Processing and analysis of miRNA data. We will process total RNA sequence data to identify expressed miRNAs, and extend the current processing pipeline to identify potentially functional miRNA sequence variants. We will apply our miRNA-centric analyses developed for The Cancer Genome Atlas project to identify: subtypes within a cancer, miRNAs that are associated with survival, miRNA targeting effects on gene and protein expression, and cis-effects of copy number and DNA methylation on miRNA abundances. 2) Regulation of and by miRNAs. Collaborating within the research network, we will extend our analysis methods to take into account additional datatypes and functional contexts that influence how miRNAs are regulated, and how they regulate genes and their products. 3) Predictive modeling. As the research network will have detailed clinical data and multiplatform genomic data, we will apply machine learning algorithms in a novel context to key sets of genes, proteins and miRNAs that predict clinical outcomes like survival and drug response. 4) Cloud computing. We will make our data, analysis methods and results readily available to a broad group of researchers within a cloud computing framework. NARRATIVE MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~22 nt) RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate levels of gene products, including proteins that are drug targets in cancer. In order to shift medical practice towards personalized treatments, the proposed research will apply innovative analysis methods to understand the role of miRNA expression on survival and drug response, within the context of DNA, RNA and protein data generated in a large research network. This will help identify cancer subtypes, and individual patient phenotypes, in which alterations in miRNA expression can lead to particular cancer progression pathways and treatment responses, in order to inform disease management.",Integrative miRNA data analysis for clinical cancer genomics,9352805,U24CA210952,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Biogenesis ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methods ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' RNA Sequences ', ' RNA, Messenger, Editing ', ' RNA Editing ', ' base ', ' Gene Copy Number ', ' Gene Dosage ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Untranslated Regions ', ' UTRs ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' Regulation ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' protein expression ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' therapy outcome ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' oncogenomics ', ' cancer genomics ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' individual patient ', ' gene product ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' genomic data ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' Genome Data Analysis Network ', ' Genomic Data Analysis Network ', ' Genome Data Analysis Center ', ' Genomic Data Analysis Center ', ' Genomic Data Commons ', ' ']",NCI,BRITISH COLUMBIA CANCER AGENCY,U24,2017,398402,0.047202338705668576
"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs).

"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient.

"Identification of Long Non-coding RNAs as Novel Biomarkers for Heterogeneous Glioblastomas PROJECT SUMMARY  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant form of brain tumors with more than 18,000 newly diagnosed patients and 13,000 deaths annually in the United States. The prognosis for GBM remains dismal with a median survival time of GBM patients of 14 to 16 months after diagnosis. A hallmark of malignant GBM is their high heterogeneity within the tumors. This unique characteristic manifests to molecular subtypes of GBM that display unique patterns of pathogenesis, biology, and prognosis. While specific molecular markers are of value in clinical care (e.g., IDH1/2 mutations, 1p/19q co-deletion), significant improvement in prognostic stratification and targeted therapeutics are urgently needed. With the ultimate goal of realizing the full potential of personalized and precision medicine, we propose to interrogate long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in a cohort of clinical GBM specimens. LncRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that have emerged as critical modulators in various cellular processes through gene regulation. Previous studies including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), though limited by their profiling technique not designed for non-coding RNAs, have suggested that lncRNAs are abundant in human cancers and are highly cancer-type-specific. In particular, lncRNAs have been implicated in brain function and glioma development. Specifically, in this exploratory project, we will apply the Ribo-Zero-based transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) to comprehensively characterize lncRNAs in 100 clinical GBM samples that have been collected at the Northwestern University Brain Tumor Tissue Bank (Aim 1a). In contrast to the oligo(dT)-based RNA-seq that was used by previous studies, including TCGA, the Ribo-Zero-based technique is optimized for non-coding RNA transcripts, thus offering a great advantage for profiling all potentially functional lncRNAs in GBM. Notably, a novel detection algorithm based on machine learning will be developed to provide a more flexible and universal framework of lncRNA detection using RNA-seq. Though restricted to those lncRNAs shared between our GBM data and the oligo(dT)-based TCGA, we will evaluate the tissue-specificity of lncRNAs detected in GBM using TCGA data on several solid tumors (Aim 1b). After characterizing the landscape of lncRNAs in GBM, we will evaluate whether lncRNAs are associated with the clinical outcomes of GBM patients, and evaluate the feasibility of integrating lncRNAs and gene-level transcripts into a prognostic tool (Aim 2a). This proposal will enable us to employ these novel biomarkers for the prognosis of GBM as well as future functional studies. In addition, we will utilize co-expression network analysis to assign functions to the detected lncRNAs in GBM. An integrated, internet-based catalog will be constructed to provide a resource of lncRNAs in GBM that will benefit the general research community in this new area (Aim 2b). Finally, the PIs have assembled an outstanding research team with significant achievements in relevant research areas and complimentary expertise, therefore ensuring the success of this multidisciplinary and highly innovative project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This work seeks to understand whether long non-coding RNAs implicate in the prognosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a form of malignant brain tumors. By characterizing these novel gene regulatory molecules in GBM, we expect to identify novel biomarkers that can be used as a prognostic tool for patients with GBM.

"Administrative Supplement: Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states.

This approach will significantly enhance the LINCS data matrix by providing phenotypic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data for cell lines under unique ME conditions. Furthermore, the data will be utilized for subsequent generation of cellular network signatures in the Data Analysis Aim. Sub aim 1.1 will be generate 10 different phenotypic endpoints for 30 cell lines grown on 3,060 MEs. We will utilize Microenvironment    Microarrays (MEMA) to assess the effects of the ME on proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation state, cell binding, and motility in each cell line. Statistical analysis will identify 50 significnt MEs for validation each year in years 2-6 in sub aim 1.2.A (total of 250 conditions). Each of the 50 ME conditions will be re-tested with the same endpoints at a second site using MEMA technology to provide independent validation of the primary results. At the same time, the cells will be tested using the 50 ME conditions on a second set of arrays designed to model the elastic modulus of human tissues to determine the effects on phenotypes of the matrix stiffness. From the 50 conditions tested in the validation aims, 30 of the most concordant between the primary and validation sites will be selected annually for analysis by Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) aim 1.2.B and RNA expression analysis (aim I.2.C.). The RPPA aim will produce data using 500 validated antibodies against proteins and phosphoproteins in key signaling pathways under each of the ME perturbations. The RNA expression analysis will examine 1000 key genes using Luminex bead technology developed by the LINCS group at the Broad Institute, who will perform the same analysis for us using RNA prepared from each of the cell lines grown under the ME conditions. In total, the RPPA and RNA expression analysis will generate data for 150 different ME conditions under 2 different elastic moduli. All data will be carefully curated, with extensive metadata collected, and provided to the LINCS community for populating the data matrix.         Public Health Relevance: The main goals of the data generation aim will be to populate the LINCS data matrix with unique information that is currently not present in the matrix, and to provide data for generation of cellular network signatures.

"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9320692,R35GM118070,"['Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biology ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Biophysics ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Development ', ' Infection ', ' Learning ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' viral RNA ', ' virus RNA ', ' Travel ', ' virology ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' macromolecule ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' Protein Biosynthesis ', ' protein synthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Synthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Biosynthesis ', ' Ribosomal Peptide Biosynthesis ', ' structural biology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Molecular ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' Outcome ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' biological systems ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2017,552994,0.1842665286905121

"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9237919,R01GM118851,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' Darkness ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Environment ', ' Fingers ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Hybrids ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Libraries ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Zinc Finger Motifs ', ' Zinc Finger Domain ', ' Zinc Fingers ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' slug ', ' Reporter ', ' scaffold ', ' scaffolding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' exhaustion ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' WT1 gene ', ' Wilms tumor suppressor WT1 ', ' Wilms Tumor 1 ', ' WT33 ', ' WT1 ', ' WAGR ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' model design ', ' DNA Binding ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' DNA Binding Domain ', ' DNA-Binding Protein Motifs ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' user-friendly ', ' loss of function ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' screening ', ' Geometry ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,410714,0.037679616556468815
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to classify multiple sclerosis Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) rests on clinical symptoms and examinations as  outlined in the revised McDonald’s criteria supported by appropriate magnetic resonance imaging findings and  other laboratory tests. The need for early diagnosis is clearly emphasized in a position paper produced in 2015  by MS Brain Health organization called “Brain health, Time matters in multiple sclerosis’ which is endorsed by  the major organizations and foundations that advocate for MS research, providers and patients including  Accelerated Cure Project (ACP), Americans Committed for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis  (ACTRIMS), The Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), European Brain Council (EBC), European  Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), European Multiple Sclerosis Platform  (EMSP), International Society of Neuroimmunology (ISNI), International Organization of Multiple Sclerosis  Nurses (IOMSN), National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), and Multiple Sclerosis Trust (MS). To cite from  their executive summary page: (1) “A therapeutic strategy that offers the best chance of preserving brain  and spinal cord tissue early in the disease course needs to be widely accepted – and urgently adopted.”  (2) “Significant delays often occur before a person with symptoms suggestive of MS sees a neurologist  for diagnosis and treatment.” (3) “Early intervention is vital.” (bold type face is theirs, not ours).   The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be  built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for  several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not  code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic  complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases  that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that  disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In  this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease  than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on MS as a disease category and have identified and validated MS associated  differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and  exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose  to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include  1) subjects with RRMS, 2) healthy controls, 3) neurologic disease controls including both inflammatory and non- inflammatory disorders, and 4) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S.  and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to  distinguish the MS cohorts from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) is a subjective diagnosis based largely on clinical  symptoms and MRI findings disseminated in time and space. Biomarkers to aid and accelerate this diagnosis  is an area of active investigation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs  with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test, and supported by our phase 1 studies, is that  classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess  greater accuracy to identify presence of MS in a subject earlier than is currently available leading to  preservation of ‘brain health’.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to classify multiple sclerosis,9405679,R44AI124766,"['Organism ', ' Paper ', ' United States ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Nurses ', ' Tissues ', ' Healthcare ', ' Genes ', ' Work ', ' Europe ', ' Exhibits ', ' Face ', ' Fibromyalgia ', ' Foundations ', ' Human ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Northern Africa ', ' Inflammation ', ' Proteins ', ' Biological Preservation ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' Research ', ' Brain ', ' Laboratories ', ' Blood ', ' Invertebrates ', ' Irritable Bowel Syndrome ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Systemic Scleroderma ', ' Asians ', ' Rest ', ' RNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' Middle East ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Suggestion ', ' Societies ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Research Subjects ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Demyelinations ', ' Persons ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Provider ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' neuroimmunology ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Hour ', ' cohort ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Biological Process ', ' Geographic Distribution ', ' Categories ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Code ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Neurologic ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Peripheral ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Whole Blood ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Inflammatory ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' disorder control ', ' health organization ', ' infancy ', ' Neurologist ', ' Trust ', ' European ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' auto-immune disease ', ' auto-immune disorder ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Advocate ', ' cost ', ' differential expression ', ' Disorder ', ' International ', ' Data ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' vertebrata ', ' Neurological ', ' human disease ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Address ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' brain health ', ' Latin American ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' French-Speaking Africa ', ' Maghreb ', ' North Africa ', ' Phase I Study ', ' living system ', ' oriental ', ' Diffuse Myofascial Pain Syndrome ', ' Fibromyositis-Fibromyalgia Syndrome ', ' Fibrositis ', ' MPD syndrome ', ' Muscular Rheumatism ', ' fibromyalgia syndrome ', ' myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Biological Markers ', ' health care ', ' Symptoms ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' phase 1 study ', ' kernel methods ', ' statistical learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' infantile ', ' Position ', ' Modern Man ', ' Biologic Preservation ', ' preservation ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Biological Function ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' early detection ', ' Coding System ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' immunoneurology ', ' Invertebrata ', ' Irritable Colon ', ' Mucous Colitis ', ' spastic colon ', ' disease control ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' mRNA ', ' Systemic Sclerosis ', ' progressive systemic sclerosis ', ' ']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2017,471900,0.07775257357878923
"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9233159,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Catalysis ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Crystallization ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' electron transfer ', ' Electron Transport ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Gases ', ' Ions ', ' Magnesium ', ' Mg element ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Metals ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Names ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Play ', ' Polyphosphates ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Standardization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Toxicology ', ' Work ', ' Zn element ', ' Zinc ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' protein folding ', ' base ', ' density ', ' macromolecule ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Intuition ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Iron ', ' Fe element ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' tool ', ' Heavy Metals ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Catalogs ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' electron density ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' drug discovery ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Metal Ion Binding ', ' Biochemical Reaction ', ' Enzymatic Reaction ', ' Biophysical Process ', ' biophysical mechanism ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Metal Binding Site ', ' Retrieval ', ' Structural Biologist ', ' Collection ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' To specify ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' protein structure prediction ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' comparative ', ' database structure ', ' data base structure ', ' model building ', ' support tools ', ' web-based tool ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2017,329119,0.11321787346216809
"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood. This proposal aims to simulate the binding process of TNF ligands with their receptors on cell surfaces by multi-scale computational methods. TNF receptors are the common drug targets for autoimmune diseases.

"Assay Classifier Engine (ACE) for enhancing splice sensor assay performance SUMMARY:  The goal of this proposal is to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the Spinach-based splice sensor platform by developing a novel multiprobe (MP) assay design and a companion machine learning-based classification algorithm called assay classifier engine (ACE). Improvement in sensitivity and specificity of the splice sensor platform enables its application to detect endogenous RNA isoforms with low copy number and distinguish alternative RNA isoforms that share high degree of sequence similarities.  The aim of any assay development effort is to achieve excellent assay specificity and sensitivity. However, this is often a futile endeavor since specificity and sensitivity are two inversely correlated factors. The underlying reason for poor sensitivity or specificity is due to the off-target signals generated by competing molecules present in the sample. In the field of diagnostics, one of the ways these issues are addressed is to perform multiple single probe testing instead of one single probe testing. While individual singe probe assays might have poor specificity and sensitivity, when combined, these assays synergistically improve the sensitivity and specificity of the ultimate diagnostic determination. In the field of research and drug discovery, researchers have employed a multitude of strategies (e.g. signal amplification, reaction cascades, or sample enrichment) to improve sensitivity and MP design or strand displacement strategies to improve specificity. Some of the PCR- based methods have combined both enzyme-based signal amplification and MP strategies to improve assay determination. However, when it comes to detecting targets that are highly similar to their competitors, such as detecting single nucleotide polymorphism, DNA methylation, RNA modification and alternative splicing, there is still an unmet need for more sensitive and specific analytical methods.  In the past few years, Lucerna has developed Spinach-based sensors to detect intractable metabolites and biomolecules. One such sensor is the splice sensor, which is a Spinach-based sensor that can generate fluorescence signal based on the alternative RNA isoform of interest. One of the challenges encountered during splice sensor assay development is the lack of sensitivity toward low copy number RNA isoforms and low specificity when distinguishing two splice isoforms that share a high sequence similarity. To overcome this challenge in this proposal, we will develop a MP assay panel comprised of splice sensor variants that recognize the target RNA and the competitor with varying binding affinities and differing signal responses. We will use data sets generated from the MP assay to train a ML-based ACE algorithm to make target determination in test samples. Further, we will develop a quantitative MP data set and re-train the ACE algorithm to classify the assay signals into various categories based on target concentrations in the test sample. This new ACE algorithm will then be tested against conventional single probe assays to determine specificity and sensitivity improvement of the MP assay platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Improved specificity and sensitivity are highly sought-after features in assays where there are high similarity between the target and its competitors or when the target exists naturally in very low abundance. To address this unmet need, we will develop a fluorescence sensor-based multiprobe assay approach and a companion machine learning-based assay classifier engine (ACE). The ACE algorithm will integrate the multiprobe assay data and classify them based on trained machine learning models to make sample determination with enhanced specificity, sensitivity, and dynamic range than possible with conventional single probe assays.",Assay Classifier Engine (ACE) for enhancing splice sensor assay performance,9622514,R43GM130258,"['Algorithms ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' ELISA ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nucleotides ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' Titrations ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' spinach ', ' Spinach - dietary ', ' Reporter ', ' Companions ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Side ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Isoforms ', ' aptamer ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' assay development ', ' drug discovery ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' targeted biomarker ', ' ']",NIGMS,"LUCERNA, INC.",R43,2018,210210,0.029651909126477003
"UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The simplest conceptual model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. In this “independent action model”, if the TF has an activation domain, it activates the genes whose promoters it binds; if it has a repression domain, it represses the genes whose promoters it binds. It is remarkable then, that in existing, comprehensive data sets, that the vast majority of genes whose promoters are bound by a TF show no change in expression when the TF is knocked down or knocked out. In yeast data where all TFs have been analyzed, only 3-5% of bound genes respond when the TF is knocked out; in more recent, but less comprehensive human data it is rarely more than 15%. Furthermore, nearly every TF appears to activate some of the genes it binds while repressing others. These data show that we do not have a credible rough draft map of the regulatory logic of any eukaryote, as most of the genes bound by a TF in existing data are not regulated by that TF and we do not know how to predict which ones are. Our preliminary results show that some, but clearly not all, of the problem can be explained by technical issues inherent to the existing datasets. We there propose to generate new, comprehensive data sets that are ideally suited to studying the relationship between binding and functional regulation (Aim 1). We will use these datasets to quantify the predictive power of the independent action model. In Aim 2, we will collect genome- wide data focused understanding the interactions between TF binding and local chromatin state to see we can use the information to extend the independent action model to increase its predictive power. Finally, we will collect genome-wide data to identify TF-TF interactions that affect the gene expression response to perturbation. We will assess the predictive power of this information using computational models. This project will produce the first consistent data set that is well suited to studying the relationship between TF binding and regulation as well as the first credible overview of regulatory logic for any eukaryote. At the conclusion, we will know why perturbation of a TF apparently activates some of the genes it binds, represses other genes it binds, and does nothing at all to most of the genes it binds. Is it just the limitations of existing high-throughput data sets, or do interactions dominate independent action? What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The textbook model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. But the reality is that existing, large genomic data sets do not support this model. The proposed project will generate new genomic data sets to directly address this problem, and will investigate to what extent TF-chromatin and TF-TF interactions affect the relationship between TF binding and gene expression.",UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION,9578803,R01GM129126,"['Affect ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Chromatin ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Histones ', ' Logic ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Proteins ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Repression ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' S cerevisiae ', "" Brewer's Yeast "", "" Baker's Yeast "", ' Testing ', ' Textbooks ', ' Thermodynamics ', ' Thermodynamic ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Writing ', ' Yeasts ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Location ', ' human data ', ' success ', ' Eukaryota ', ' Eukaryote ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' ChIP assay ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Knockout ', ' Knock-out ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predicting response ', ' genomic data ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' ']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,311500,0.020505443072372825
"Novel Nanopore-based RNA Sequencing using Nucleobase-specific Tags Project Summary Cost-effective, and accurate sequencing of RNA, composed of both canonical and modified bases, of any length, without conversion to cDNA, and without amplification are the objectives of this project, and the ultimate goal is to sequence the transcriptome, and determine in a time-sensitive manner relative distribution of its components. Such accomplishment will directly impact prevention, diagnosis, and cure of disease and materialize the promise of personalized medicine. Current methods, such as Illumina's RNA-Seq, and the single molecule approaches of Pacific Biosciences and of Oxford Nanopore Technologies, still lag behind in many of the critical attributes mentioned above. The unresolved issue with nanopore-based sequencing is the observation that ion current vs. time recording does not refer to a single nucleobase, but to a short sequence of 4 or more bases. The problem, partially resolved with the use of sophisticated algorithms and learning machines, appears intractable for RNA that includes numerous post-transcriptional base modifications. As an illustration, if a nanopore reads a sequence of 4 bases and the specific RNA to be sequenced has a total of 8 different nucleobases (4 canonical and 4 modified), then 48 = 65,536 signals need to be discriminated from within an ion current range of 20 to 40 pA with a standard deviation of ±1 pA; this is an impossible computational task. However, if the nanopore could sense one base at a time and yield distinct ion current for each base, there will be only 8 different recordings to distinguish from, a much simpler task. Our own published results indicate that oligodeoxynucleotides conjugated with a pyrimidine-specific tag (Osmium tetroxide 2,2'-bipyrimidine or OsBp) yield enzyme-free, slow/readable translocation via α- Hemolysin, and distinct ion current levels for intact, T(OsBp), and C(OsBp) bases, suggesting that a single tag can yield sequencing information on purine, T, and C. The latter leads to the conjecture that the presence of a second, purine-specific, label would allow identification of all four canonical bases. Furthermore each tag has intrinsic selectivity for one base over another, and this will provide a handle for additional discrimination among the modified bases. In this phase I proposal we aim to demonstrate (i) near 100% labeling (true positives) with 0% internucleotide bond cleavage, and 0% false positives for RNA(OsBp), as we have already shown for DNA(OsBp), (ii) comparable labeling attributes for a purine-specific tag, and (iii) readable translocation with single pyrimidine base discrimination for RNA(OsBp). Success in these efforts will lead to single base discrimination and sequencing of RNA, including a number of post-transcriptionally modified bases, and pave the road for sequencing the transcriptome. ! PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in personalized medicine for diagnosis and treatment of disease require sequencing the RNA transcriptome with technologies that are currently unavailable.

Each of the 50 ME conditions will be re-tested with the same endpoints at a second site using MEMA technology to provide independent validation of the primary results. At the same time, the cells will be tested using the 50 ME conditions on a second set of arrays designed to model the elastic modulus of human tissues to determine the effects on phenotypes of the matrix stiffness. From the 50 conditions tested in the validation aims, 30 of the most concordant between the primary and validation sites will be selected annually for analysis by Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) aim 1.2.B and RNA expression analysis (aim I.2.C.). The RPPA aim will produce data using 500 validated antibodies against proteins and phosphoproteins in key signaling pathways under each of the ME perturbations. The RNA expression analysis will examine 1000 key genes using Luminex bead technology developed by the LINCS group at the Broad Institute, who will perform the same analysis for us using RNA prepared from each of the cell lines grown under the ME conditions. In total, the RPPA and RNA expression analysis will generate data for 150 different ME conditions under 2 different elastic moduli. All data will be carefully curated, with extensive metadata collected, and provided to the LINCS community for populating the data matrix.         Public Health Relevance: The main goals of the data generation aim will be to populate the LINCS data matrix with unique information that is currently not present in the matrix, and to provide data for generation of cellular network signatures. Our proposal to use MEMA technology will identify unique combinatorial MEs that perturb various phenotypic endpoints, providing novel data to fill in the LINCS data matrix.            ",Extrinsic Perturbations of Cell Physiology and Associated Regulatory Networks,9538214,U54HG008100,"['Adhesions ', ' Antibodies ', ' Archives ', ' Behavior ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' cell motility ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' ECM ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' Genes ', ' Glycoproteins ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Institutes ', ' Methods ', ' Peptides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phosphoproteins ', ' Proteins ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Standardization ', ' Synapses ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Apoptosis ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Data Quality ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Tern ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' human tissue ', ' System ', ' novel ', ' genetic regulatory protein ', ' regulatory gene product ', ' Regulatory Protein ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' Protein Array ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' microarray technology ', ' microarray analyses ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' transcriptomics ', ' combinatorial ', ' cell behavior ', ' fluorescent imaging ', ' fluorescence imaging ', ' senescent ', ' senescence ', ' public health relevance ', ' internet portal ', ' web portal ', ' phospho-proteomics ', ' phosphoproteomics ', ' Modulus ', ' high resolution imaging ', ' ']",NHGRI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U54,2018,1821037,0.11729001209541591
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to classify multiple sclerosis Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) rests on clinical symptoms and examinations as  outlined in the revised McDonald’s criteria supported by appropriate magnetic resonance imaging findings and  other laboratory tests. The need for early diagnosis is clearly emphasized in a position paper produced in 2015  by MS Brain Health organization called “Brain health, Time matters in multiple sclerosis’ which is endorsed by  the major organizations and foundations that advocate for MS research, providers and patients including  Accelerated Cure Project (ACP), Americans Committed for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis  (ACTRIMS), The Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), European Brain Council (EBC), European  Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), European Multiple Sclerosis Platform  (EMSP), International Society of Neuroimmunology (ISNI), International Organization of Multiple Sclerosis  Nurses (IOMSN), National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), and Multiple Sclerosis Trust (MS). To cite from  their executive summary page: (1) “A therapeutic strategy that offers the best chance of preserving brain  and spinal cord tissue early in the disease course needs to be widely accepted – and urgently adopted.”  (2) “Significant delays often occur before a person with symptoms suggestive of MS sees a neurologist  for diagnosis and treatment.” (3) “Early intervention is vital.” (bold type face is theirs, not ours).   The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be  built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for  several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not  code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic  complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases  that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that  disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In  this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease  than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on MS as a disease category and have identified and validated MS associated  differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and  exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose  to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include  1) subjects with RRMS, 2) healthy controls, 3) neurologic disease controls including both inflammatory and non- inflammatory disorders, and 4) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S.  and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to  distinguish the MS cohorts from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) is a subjective diagnosis based largely on clinical  symptoms and MRI findings disseminated in time and space. Biomarkers to aid and accelerate this diagnosis  is an area of active investigation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs  with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test, and supported by our phase 1 studies, is that  classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess  greater accuracy to identify presence of MS in a subject earlier than is currently available leading to  preservation of ‘brain health’.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to classify multiple sclerosis,9501679,R44AI124766,"['Northern Africa ', ' North Africa ', ' Maghreb ', ' French-Speaking Africa ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Demyelinations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Europe ', ' Exhibits ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Fibromyalgia ', ' myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome ', ' fibromyalgia syndrome ', ' Muscular Rheumatism ', ' MPD syndrome ', ' Fibrositis ', ' Fibromyositis-Fibromyalgia Syndrome ', ' Diffuse Myofascial Pain Syndrome ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Invertebrates ', ' Invertebrata ', ' Irritable Bowel Syndrome ', ' spastic colon ', ' Mucous Colitis ', ' Irritable Colon ', ' Laboratories ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Middle East ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' Persons ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Systemic Scleroderma ', ' progressive systemic sclerosis ', ' Systemic Sclerosis ', ' Societies ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Suggestion ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Vertebrates ', ' vertebrata ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' Work ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Research Subjects ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' Peripheral ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Neurologist ', ' Trust ', ' European ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Whole Blood ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' neuroimmunology ', ' immunoneurology ', ' cohort ', ' Geographic Distribution ', ' Categories ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' health organization ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' cost ', ' human disease ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' differential expression ', ' brain health ', ' Latin American ', ' preservation ', ' ']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2018,762169,0.07775257357878923
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,9486119,R35GM127040,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Goals ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Specificity ', ' Work ', ' Protein Domains ', ' Peptide Domain ', ' Tertiary Protein Structure ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Biological ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Molecular Models ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' drug development ', ' drug discovery ', ' mimetics ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' small molecule ', ' Length ', ' Affinity ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' multi-task ', ' multitask ', ' therapeutic target ', ' screening ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' ']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2018,297553,0.05545355635883443
"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases.

"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood. This proposal aims to simulate the binding process of TNF ligands with their receptors on cell surfaces by multi-scale computational methods. TNF receptors are the common drug targets for autoimmune diseases. Understand their cellular mechanism of binding therefore is highly relevant to public health.",Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces,9567985,R01GM122804,"['Affect ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cadherins ', ' Cell Adhesion ', ' Cellular Adhesion ', ' Cell membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chimera organism ', ' Chimera ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Environment ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Goals ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leukocytes ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Ligands ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Fluorescence Microscopy ', ' Fluorescence Light Microscopy ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Swelling ', ' Testing ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factors ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Family Protein ', ' TNF Receptor Ligands ', ' Weight ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Family ', ' TNFR ', ' TNF Receptors ', ' TNF Receptor Superfamily ', ' TNF Receptor Family Protein ', ' Cachectin Receptors ', ' cytokine ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Cell Surface Proteins ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Host Defense ', ' extracellular ', ' interest ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' physical process ', ' Physical Phenomena or Properties ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor binding ', ' receptor bound ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' simulation ', ' Cell surface ', ' TNF gene ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor ', ' TNFα ', ' TNFA ', ' TNF-α ', ' TNF Alpha ', ' TNF A ', ' TNF ', ' Monocyte-Derived TNF ', ' Macrophage-Derived TNF ', ' Cachectin ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Protein Databases ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' protein complex ', ' Homo ', ' tumor necrosis factor receptor binding ', ' Affinity ', ' Avidity ', ' Mutate ', ' Resolution ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Tumor Process ', ' Tumor-Associated Process ', ' Validation ', ' Whole Organism ', ' Molecular ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' injured ', ' multiscale modeling ', ' multi-scale modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' pathogen ', ' NH2-terminal ', ' N-terminal ', ' large-scale data base ', ' large-scale database ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' Innate Immune System ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIGMS,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2018,142621,0.05461592269701534
"Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines Peptides bound to class I HLA molecules (HLA-A, -B and –C) arise from endogenous or foreign proteins that are cleaved by the proteasome and peptidases of the endoplasmic reticulum prior to loading and display by surface HLA class I proteins. Each HLA allele is estimated to bind and present ~1,000-10,000 unique peptides to T cells. Given such diversity in HLA binding, an important question is whether we can predict whether a particular peptide is likely to bind to a specific HLA allele. Indeed, peptide-binding rules have been long-studied extensively for a subset of HLA alleles and encoded in advanced neural network-based algorithms that predict binding. Historically, little attention has been paid to HLA-C because of its perceived lower surface expression and hence predictive algorithms of HLA-C are very much lacking, as only a few thousand peptides epitopes have been reported in databases. New studies, however, suggests that important epitopes can arise from HLA-C, and have been detected for HIV, EBV, CMV and influenza. Our hypothesis is that large-scale datasets of endogenous HLA bound peptides can improve prediction of binding, and that through applying such an approach to HLA-C, a substantial increase in numbers of actionable immunogenic targets on tumor cells can be gained. Recently, I spearheaded a successful effort to integrate my expertise in experimental workflows for the isolation of HLA-bound peptides with newly available innovations in analysis and instrumentation for mass spectrometry (MS) to create a high throughput MS-based approach for the physical detection of peptides directly displayed by HLA molecules. This workflow and analytic framework now provides an exciting opportunity to generate high-quality data to directly address these challenges. In Aim 1, to systematically identify HLA-C binding peptides, we will use MS to provide experimentally-derived datasets of peptides from 21 HLA-C alleles to provide 99.9% global population coverage. In Aim 2, to define the rules of processing and presentation across HLA-C de novo, we will discover the binding motifs of the HLA-C peptides and use this information to develop predictive algorithms, which we will validate using independent datasets. In Aim 3, we seek to determine if predicted tumor neoepitopes are physically detected on patient tumor cells. We will perform experimental validation of HLA-C prediction algorithms directly on tumor samples available from study subjects enrolled on high-priority clinical trials of personalized neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccines at DFCI using a new nano-scale MS-based analysis. We will confirm the immunogenicity of the detected HLA-C epitopes through in vitro T cell assays using banked peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from study subjects. We anticipate the proposed studies to enable fuller understanding HLA-C epitope presentation, more robust prediction of HLA-C peptide epitopes, and expansion of the spectrum of actionable immune targets. Immune recognition of short peptides representative of proteins within a cell in conjunction with a group of surface molecules called HLA is essential for the process of immune reactivity but characterization of the properties of how these peptides bind to HLA molecules has been constrained by the limited available information about these peptides. We have developed a new high-throughput approach to rapidly isolate thousands of HLA-bound peptides directly from informative cell lines and tumor samples (from patients with melanoma, glioblastoma and renal cell cancer) and to use this information to develop novel algorithms to predict binding of peptides to HLA. We anticipate the proposed studies t o enable fuller understanding of how a subset of understudied HLA molecules (i.e. HLA-C) interact with their binding peptides, to improve prediction of HLA-C bound peptides, and to expand the spectrum of actionable immune targets.",Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer

"Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases No other group of diseases encompasses a greater pathophysiology than do the rheumatic diseases. Spanning multiple organ systems, clinical decisions often rely on coordinated efforts from primary care providers and rheumatologists to rule in or rule out differential diagnoses when treating inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). RA is a symmetric, inflammatory, peripheral polyarthritis leading to deformity of joints via erosion of bone and surrounding cartilage. SLE can affect virtually any organ leading to fatigue, fever, myalgia, weight change and complications associated with renal, central nervous system, and hematologic systems can be life-threatening. RA and SLE are diagnosed through clinical judgment after excluding alternative diagnoses. In the case of both diseases, individual laboratory tests are effective only in a portion of the disease population. Across these analyses, the sensitivity and specificity for these laboratory measurements may have high specificity to rule in SLE but lack sensitivity as these diagnostic markers can be found in other disorders. As a physician colleague pointed out, “it is difficult to diagnose a negative”. Diagnostic approaches for both RA and SLE often rely on multiple, independent laboratory tests combined with clinical observation. Distinguishing between these diseases is important since treatment procedures for these diseases are different. Time is a factor in diagnosis of these diseases and tools are required to facilitate earlier diagnosis as treatment for autoimmune diseases are highly effective and early initiation of therapy leads to the best outcomes. Misdiagnosis of these conditions is not uncommon. Another common disease seen by rheumatologists is fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). FMS is a common cause of widespread musculoskeletal pain that affects tendons, ligaments, and muscle. FMS is difficult to diagnose and treat and a critical clinical point is that FMS is not explained by another rheumatic or systemic disorder. Thus, FMS is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies have been considered and excluded. RA and SLE are two diseases that must be eliminated from the differential diagnosis. Given the complicated diagnostic process these patients are often forced to endure, recent studies have also suggested that healthcare dollars are saved post-diagnosis and patient outcomes improve. To date, there is no laboratory test that can determine presence or absence of these three conditions from a single blood sample.  The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on FMS and the rheumatic diseases as disease categories and have identified and validated FMS and rheumatic disease-associated associated differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include 1) subjects with fibromyalgia syndrome, 2) healthy controls, 3) rheumatoid arthritis, 4) systemic lupus erythematosus, and 5) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S. and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic diseases from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome and other rheumatic diseases can be a difficult, long and costly process and misdiagnosis of these diseases is not uncommon. Biomarkers to aid and accelerate diagnosis is an area of active investigation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test, and supported by our phase 1 studies, is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess greater accuracy to identify fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic disease and provide meaningful clinical information to health- care providers faced with these diagnostic dilemmas.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases,9555179,R44AI129147,"['Affect ', ' Rheumatoid Arthritis ', ' rheumatic arthritis ', ' Atrophic Arthritis ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Cartilage ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Europe ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fever ', ' febris ', ' febrile ', ' Pyrexia ', ' Fibromyalgia ', ' myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome ', ' fibromyalgia syndrome ', ' Muscular Rheumatism ', ' MPD syndrome ', ' Fibrositis ', ' Fibromyositis-Fibromyalgia Syndrome ', ' Diffuse Myofascial Pain Syndrome ', ' Genes ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Invertebrates ', ' Invertebrata ', ' Joints ', ' Judgment ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Laboratories ', ' Ligaments ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE - Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' SLE ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' Mixed Connective Tissue Disease ', ' Sharp Syndrome ', ' Muscle ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Rheumatism ', ' Rheumatologic Disorder ', ' Rheumatic Diseases ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain Disorder ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Tendon structure ', ' Tendons ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vertebrates ', ' vertebrata ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' Work ', ' Research Subjects ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' polyarthritis ', ' Polyarthritides ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Procedures ', ' Peripheral ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Myosalgia ', ' Myoneuralgia ', ' Myodynia ', ' Myalgic ', ' Muscle sorenesss ', ' Muscle pain/fibrositis ', ' Muscle pain ', ' Muscle discomfort ', ' Aching muscles ', ' Myalgia ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Deformity ', ' Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Whole Blood ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' body system ', ' Organ System ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' cohort ', ' Exclusion ', ' Geographic Distribution ', ' Categories ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Sjögren Syndrome ', ' Sjogrens ', "" Sjogren's Syndrome "", ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' human disease ', ' rheumatologist ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' Phase I Study ', ' phase 1 study ', ' bone erosion ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' differential expression ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' improved outcome ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' ']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2018,465662,0.053070921413887334
"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Although MDS is used as the prototype of disease for this proposal, the system developed will be applicable to multiple diseases with complex phenotypes.",Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions,9565604,R01GM123037,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22 ', ' Chromosome 22 ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Environment ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Genome ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Hematopoietic stem cells ', ' hematopoietic stem progenitor cell ', ' hematopoietic progenitor ', ' Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells ', ' Blood Precursor Cell ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes ', ' myelodysplasia ', ' Smoldering Leukemia ', ' Refractory anaemia with excess blasts ', ' Refractory Anemia with an Excess of Blasts ', ' Myelodysplastic Syndromes ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Proteins ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Triplet Multiple Birth ', ' Triplets ', ' Work ', ' X Chromosome ', ' base ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,9693353,R01GM123314,"['Algorithms ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Exons ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Maps ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Ribonucleoproteins ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' protein profiling ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' K562 Cells ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' RNA Binding ', ' RNA bound ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' protein expression ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Protein Binding Domain ', ' Protein-Protein Interaction Domain ', ' Protein Binding Motif ', ' RNA-Protein Interaction ', ' Computational Technique ', ' K562 blasts ', ' K562 ', ' K-562 ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' RNP-1 Signature ', ' RNP Motif ', ' RNP Domain ', ' RNA Binding Domain ', ' Putative RNA-Binding Region ', ' RNA Recognition Motif ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' deep sequencing ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' computational studies ', ' computer studies ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' user-friendly ', ' human disease ', ' comparative ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 ', ' MALAT1 ', ' MALAT1 gene ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' differential expression ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' Hep G2 ', ' HepG2 ', ' High-throughput sequencing of CLIP cDNA library ', ' HITS-CLIP ', ' CLIP-Seq ', ' crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing ', ' predictive tools ', ' web-based resource ', ' web resource ', ' online compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' internet resource ', ' online resource ', ' ']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2018,137386,0.13268414676822698
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9648208,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Methods ', ' Oropharyngeal Neoplasms ', ' oral pharyngeal neoplasm ', ' Oropharynx Tumor ', ' Oropharynx Neoplasms ', ' Oropharyngeal Tumor ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' malignant oropharynx tumor ', ' Oropharynx Carcinoma ', ' Oropharynx Cancer ', ' Oropharyngeal Carcinoma ', ' Oropharyngeal Cancer ', ' Oropharnyx Cancers ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Tumor ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Neoplasm ', ' malignant oropharynx neoplasm ', ' therapy failure ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Oropharyngeal ', ' oral pharyngeal ', ' Oropharynxs ', ' Oropharynx ', ' Reporting ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Institution ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' Data ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Prognosis ', ' Validation ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' prospective ', ' Oncogenic ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' Patient risk ', ' microRNA sequencing ', ' micro RNA expression profiling ', ' miRNA-seq ', ' miRNA sequencing ', ' global miRNA profiling ', ' MicroRNA Expression Profiling ', ' miRNA expression profiling ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' patient biomarkers ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subsets ', ' microRNA markers ', ' miRNA markers ', ' miRNA biomarkers ', ' microRNA biomarkers ', ' prognostic test ', ' prognostic assays ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' ']",NIDCR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,34680,0.0411748111565834
"The next generation of RNA-Seq simulators for benchmarking analyses Abstract: RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) has established itself as the primary method for studying transcription in basic research, with an emerging role in the clinic – currently upwards of 5,000 publications using the technology are indexed in PubMed. However, the interpretation of RNA-Seq requires several complex operations including alignment, quantification, normalization and statistical analyses of various types. Since its inception a large number of algorithms have appeared for each step, creating a very confusing landscape for investigators. In order to determine the best analysis practices, numerous benchmarking studies have emerged which leverage real RNA-Seq data made from well-studied RNA samples, such as the Genetic European Variation in Health and Disease (GEUVADIS) consortium data. These valuable RNA-Seq datasets contain the biases and errors introduced by sequencing biochemistry—factors that any analysis method must account for and overcome. However, the utility of such datasets for benchmarking analysis methods is limited by the fact that we do not know the underlying truth (e.g. the true number of RNA molecules from each transcript in the original sample). Therefore researchers tend to rely heavily on simulated data, since we know everything about the true composition of these samples. There are dozens of DNA simulators aimed at benchmarking applications such as variant calling. And while the need for simulators is just as strong in RNA analysis, there are only a scant few RNA-Seq simulators available. Furthermore, the available RNA- Seq simulators are based on simplifying assumptions that greatly restrict their utility for benchmarking anything but the most upstream steps in the analysis pipeline (e.g. alignment). The further downstream the analysis method is, the more accurately the true nature of real data and its technical biases need to be modeled in order to draw meaningful conclusions. For example, no simulator generates data from a diploid genome, which would be necessary to evaluate allele specific quantification. Given our extensive experience with RNA-Seq analysis and transcriptomics in general, and our success at building the BEERS simulator, and our track record of authorship on all comprehensive RNA-Seq aligner benchmarking studies published to date, we are ideally situated to develop the next generation of open-source RNA-Seq simulator which aims to model all sources of technical variability. Furthermore, the simulator will model biological variability with an empirical approach based on using real data to configure the simulator’s parameters, which is a natural problem for machine learning. There are eleven steps in RNA-Seq library preparation which introduce bias, all of which will be modeled by the software in an object-oriented modular framework. Project Narrative: There have been many algorithms developed for every step of the RNA-Seq analysis pipeline with no easy way to compare between them. Simulated data are useful for this purpose, but to date there are very few RNA-Seq simulators available and all make too many simplifying assumptions to be used for anything but the most upstream steps in the pipeline, e.g. alignment.

"Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq. PROJECT ABSTRACT Deciphering how complex programs of gene expression and regulation contribute to human disease is one of the major challenges facing the field of genomics. Over the past decade, a wealth of new high-throughput genomics tools have revolutionized how we identify active genomic regions and appear poised to make great strides in understanding the mechanisms of disease. Yet the application of most of these technologies has been limited to established cell lines. Currently, approaches being developed to comprehensively map functional elements across the genome involve combining data from several different genome-wide experimental assays, making them expensive and impractical to use in clinical isolates of limited quantity or even to analyze new cell lines. Compounding these technical difficulties, gene expression is a complex and highly tissue dependent biological process, and many important applications will require the direct interrogation of clinical isolates or other similarly limited sources of sample. Thus, efficient new tools that map the repertoire of functional elements across the genome are likely to transform the biomedical and clinical sciences.  We propose to develop Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing (ChRO-seq) and a suite of computational tools for mapping transcription directly in limited tissue samples. Our approach uses a single genome-wide molecular assay to efficiently identify the location of promoters and enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, gene and lincRNA boundaries, transcription levels, and impute certain histone modifications. Preliminary ChRO-seq data reveals patterns of transcription that are virtually identical to those using Precision Run on and Sequencing in cultured cells, but can easily be applied in solid tissue samples. We applied our preliminary ChRO-seq technology to several primary tumors, revealing new insights into how transcriptional regulation underlies cancer development and progression, and providing a key proof-of-concept motivating further technology development. We anticipate that ChRO-seq and the computational methods proposed will enable the efficient discovery of functional elements in virtually any cell sample. In addition, ChRO-seq has the unique advantage that it can be applied in limited tissue samples and clinical isolates even after the degradation of mRNA. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a suite of molecular and computational technologies that allow researchers to directly measure transcriptional regulation of genes, enhancers, and lincRNAs in limited clinical isolates.

"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs. RNA structure is detrimental to RNA function and regulatory element activity. Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops. This will allow him to learn innovative and effective ways to teach biology and progress to become a well- rounded scientist and mentor. Dr. Beaudoin existing expertise and the scientific and training plans of this proposal will allow him to reaching his long-term career goal: to establish a research program to understand the role of RNA structures and RNA helicases in vertebrate development. Defective RNA helicases have been associated to dozens of human diseases (e.g. infertility, neurological disorders, cancers and aging). Therefore, their molecular characterization in a relevant vertebrate model will provide invaluable insights to develop new human therapeutic approaches. Dr. Beaudoin is fully committed to obtain an appointment as a tenure track junior faculty in academia. It is fully expected that Dr. Beaudoin will be competitive for such group leader appointments at the completion of his K99/R00 Award tailored to enhance his scientific and mentoring skills. NARRATIVE  Every animal's life starts by a drastic and controlled remodeling of gene expression following the fertilization of the egg by the sperm.

"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,9563289,R01GM123314,"['Algorithms ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Exons ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Maps ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Ribonucleoproteins ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' protein profiling ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' K562 Cells ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' RNA Binding ', ' RNA bound ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' protein expression ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Protein Binding Domain ', ' Protein-Protein Interaction Domain ', ' Protein Binding Motif ', ' RNA-Protein Interaction ', ' Computational Technique ', ' K562 blasts ', ' K562 ', ' K-562 ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' RNP-1 Signature ', ' RNP Motif ', ' RNP Domain ', ' RNA Binding Domain ', ' Putative RNA-Binding Region ', ' RNA Recognition Motif ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' deep sequencing ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' computational studies ', ' computer studies ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' user-friendly ', ' human disease ', ' comparative ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 ', ' MALAT1 ', ' MALAT1 gene ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' differential expression ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' Hep G2 ', ' HepG2 ', ' High-throughput sequencing of CLIP cDNA library ', ' HITS-CLIP ', ' CLIP-Seq ', ' crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing ', ' predictive tools ', ' web-based resource ', ' web resource ', ' online compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' internet resource ', ' online resource ', ' ']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2018,303474,0.13268414676822698
"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease.

"Systematic, Genome-Scale Functional Characterization of Conserved smORFs PROJECT SUMMARY Short peptides (10-100aa) are important regulators of physiology, development and metabolism, however their detection is difficult due to size and abundance. A stunning 30% of annotated human smORF genes include disease-associated variants mapped within exons, compared to 15% of human genes in general. Further, many smORFs are conserved across the entire metazoan phylogeny from invertebrates to vertebrates including man. These ultra-conserved functional smORF genes we call the Conserved smORF Catalog or CSC. These genes have been conserved across more than 500myr of evolution, and yet we know almost nothing at all about their functions. Due to a century of genetic analysis, the genome of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster has the most complete functional annotation among metazoans. Functional annotations derived from Drosophila have been instrumental in hypothesis-based drug development for more than thirty years, and more recently have made possible the biological interpretation of hundreds of SNPs detected in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Hence, functional annotations derived in fly for conserved genes are transferable to human and are of direct clinical relevance. Remarkably, less than 10% of smORFs in Drosophila have been studied functionally, or experimentally verified as generating peptides. A combination of genome engineering, computational, molecular, and functional studies will be used to systematically and comprehensively characterize the CSC, representing the first genome-scale characterization of smORFs in any organism providing a wealth of information on the biological functions of this poorly studied class of proteins. In total, we will characterize and functionally annotate ~400 conserved smORFs using CRISPR knockout followed by phenotyping and rescue assays. We will assess the phenotypes of the mutants, measuring viability, morphology, fecundity and fertility, lifespan, metabolism (sugar and lipid levels), and a number of behavioral phenotypes. For smORFs with robust phenotypes, we will then attempt to rescue a subset of these mutants in three ways: first, by inserting the whole deleted RNA; second, with a version of the RNA with the smORF(s) removed by the addition a stop codon; and lastly, using a micro- construct containing only the smORF and the endogenous promoter. We will generate direct evidence for translation using tagged expression analysis and targeted MS/MS to scan for predicted polypeptides in the whole embryo and tissue dissection samples. In addition to validating the existence of the predicted molecules, this dataset will provide a foundational gold standard for further development of tools for the computational prediction of functional micropeptides. These studies are directed toward the understanding of basic life processes and lay the foundation for promoting better human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE As a public resource, our studies will combine genome-scale phenotyping with detailed functional characterization that will assess the effects of evolutionary conserved small open reading frames (smORFs) on animal viability, development, fecundity, metabolism, longevity and behavior. We will apply state-of-the art methods in Ribosomal profiling, CRISPR genome engineering and targeted mass spectrometry together with the development of new computational tools and analyses to generate a foundational gold standard dataset for the study of smORFs and the prediction of functional smORFs in genome annotation. Many of the genes encoding these molecules have been found to play important roles in human diseases such as neurodegeneration, developmental disorders and cancer.","Systematic, Genome-Scale

"Integrative miRNA data analysis for clinical cancer genomics PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed research has two broad, long-term objectives. First, it seeks to shift medical practice toward more personalized treatments, by applying innovative methods to analyze and integrate DNA, RNA and protein data generated by a large network of GDAN researchers in a miRNA-centric framework. Analyses will identify cancer subtypes, and individual patients within a subtype, in which alterations in the expression of certain miRNAs influence cancer pathogenesis and drug response. Second, the proposed research seeks to shift cancer genomics research by allowing a diverse group of cancer researchers to flexibly access and use the project’s cancer genomics data, and microRNA-centric results and methods, through a cloud computing framework. The proposed research has three specific aims: 1) Build a computational pipeline for processing and analysis of miRNA data, 2) Elucidate the regulation of and by miRNAs through integrative analysis, and 3) Delineate the role of miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment using predictive modeling. Research design and methods: 1) Processing and analysis of miRNA data. We will process total RNA sequence data to identify expressed miRNAs, and extend the current processing pipeline to identify potentially functional miRNA sequence variants. We will apply our miRNA-centric analyses developed for The Cancer Genome Atlas project to identify: subtypes within a cancer, miRNAs that are associated with survival, miRNA targeting effects on gene and protein expression, and cis-effects of copy number and DNA methylation on miRNA abundances. 2) Regulation of and by miRNAs. Collaborating within the research network, we will extend our analysis methods to take into account additional datatypes and functional contexts that influence how miRNAs are regulated, and how they regulate genes and their products. 3) Predictive modeling. As the research network will have detailed clinical data and multiplatform genomic data, we will apply machine learning algorithms in a novel context to key sets of genes, proteins and miRNAs that predict clinical outcomes like survival and drug response. 4) Cloud computing. We will make our data, analysis methods and results readily available to a broad group of researchers within a cloud computing framework. NARRATIVE MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~22 nt) RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate levels of gene products, including proteins that are drug targets in cancer. In order to shift medical practice towards personalized treatments, the proposed research will apply innovative analysis methods to understand the role of miRNA expression on survival and drug response, within the context of DNA, RNA and protein data generated in a large research network.

"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9535392,R35GM118070,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biology ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Learning ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' viral RNA ', ' virus RNA ', ' Travel ', ' virology ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' macromolecule ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' Protein Biosynthesis ', ' protein synthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Synthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Biosynthesis ', ' Ribosomal Peptide Biosynthesis ', ' structural biology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Molecular ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' Outcome ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biological systems ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2018,552994,0.1842665286905121

"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Our goals are to carry out the deepest analysis of gene activation by a single CRE in higher eukaryotes, and to understand how multiple CREs integrates activation and repression to pattern the embryo.",Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation,9450518,R01GM051946,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Algorithms ', ' Animals ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' fruit fly ', ' Drosophila ', ' Elements ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Logic ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Repression ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Zinc Fingers ', ' Zinc Finger Motifs ', ' Zinc Finger Domain ', ' Enhancers ', ' Mediating ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' Protein Domains ', ' Peptide Domain ', ' Tertiary Protein Structure ', ' GBF protein ', ' GBF bZIP protein ', ' bZIP Protein ', ' base ', ' cofactor ', ' Anterior ', ' Site ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Measurement ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Homeotic Proteins ', ' Homeoproteins ', ' Homeodomain Family Protein ', ' Homeobox Proteins ', ' Homeobox Family Protein ', ' Homeo Domain Proteins ', ' Homeodomain Proteins ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Body Patterning ', ' Body Pattern Specification ', ' Body Pattern Formation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' transgenic ', ' Transact ', ' Eukaryota ', ' Eukaryote ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' single molecule ', ' Gene Order ', ' Gene Position ', ' Gene Arrangement ', ' DNA Binding ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' Pattern Formation ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Defect ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vitro Assay ', ' in vivo ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Flies ', ' fly ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' loss of function mutation ', ' morphogens ', ' public health relevance ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,362333,0.05552747866471618
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is entitled “Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning.” A number of in- terrelated computational methods for making predictions about the biological behavior of small molecules have been the subject of development within the Jain Laboratory for over twenty years. These share a common strat- egy that considers molecular interactions at their surface interface, where proteins and ligands actually interact. These methods yield measurements of similarity between small molecules or between protein binding pockets. They also yield measurements of the complementarity of a small molecule to a protein binding site (the molecular docking problem). A generalization of these concepts makes possible the construction of a virtual binding site for quantitative activity prediction purely from data about the biological activities of a set of small molecules.  The goals of the proposed work include further improving the accuracy and breadth of applicability of the binding site modeling approach. The primary application of the approach is to guide optimization of leads within medicinal chemistry projects, and to quantify potential off-target effects during pre-clinical drug discovery.  A critical focus of the work will be in data and software dissemination, in order to accelerate the efficient development of targeted therapies. In addition to methods development, the proposed work will involve broad application of these state-of-the-art predictive modeling methods. The proposed work will proceed with the col- laborative input of our pharmaceutical industry colleagues, who have specialized knowledge and data sets that are vital for cutting-edge work in computer-aided drug design.  The expected results include more efficient lead optimization (fewer compounds to reach desired biological pa- rameters), truly effective scaffold replacement (to move away from a molecular series with biological limitations), and improved computational predictions of off-target effects during pre-clinical drug design. Project Narrative This project seeks to refine an integrated platform for physically realistic prediction of ligand binding affinities using multiple methods that span small molecule molecular similarity, molecular docking, and protein binding site similarity. These tools will provide predictive modeling unrestrained by scaffold congruence between what is known and what is to be predicted.

"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9522076,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Methods ', ' Oropharyngeal Neoplasms ', ' oral pharyngeal neoplasm ', ' Oropharynx Tumor ', ' Oropharynx Neoplasms ', ' Oropharyngeal Tumor ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' malignant oropharynx tumor ', ' Oropharynx Carcinoma ', ' Oropharynx Cancer ', ' Oropharyngeal Carcinoma ', ' Oropharyngeal Cancer ', ' Oropharnyx Cancers ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Tumor ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Neoplasm ', ' malignant oropharynx neoplasm ', ' therapy failure ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Oropharyngeal ', ' oral pharyngeal ', ' Oropharynxs ', ' Oropharynx ', ' Reporting ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Institution ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' Data ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Prognosis ', ' Validation ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' prospective ', ' Oncogenic ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' Patient risk ', ' microRNA sequencing ', ' micro RNA expression profiling ', ' miRNA-seq ', ' miRNA sequencing ', ' global miRNA profiling ', ' MicroRNA Expression Profiling ', ' miRNA expression profiling ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' patient biomarkers ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subsets ', ' microRNA markers ', ' miRNA markers ', ' miRNA biomarkers ', ' microRNA biomarkers ', ' prognostic test ', ' prognostic assays ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' ']",NIDCR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,466230,0.0411748111565834
"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population.

"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells. Control of cell states, such as in maintenance of pluripotency by stem cells or differentiation into defined cell lineages, holds promise for regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. These cell fate programs are initiated by `pioneer factors' that recognize their genomic target sites and induce hierarchies of gene regulatory programs. We will identify human pioneer factors and characterize their regulatory interactions.",Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA,9550852,R21HG009268,"['Affect ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cataloging ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Deoxyribonuclease I ', ' Thymonuclease ', ' Pancreatic DNase ', ' DNase I ', ' DNA Endonuclease ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Engineering ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Allergy ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maintenance ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' Therapeutic ', ' ds-DNA ', ' dsDNA ', ' Double-Stranded DNA ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' cell type ', ' technology development ', ' tech development ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Reporting ', ' Gatekeeping ', ' gatekeeper ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' high throughput technology ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay ', ' gel shift assay ', ' Mobility Shift Assay ', ' Bandshift Mobility Assay ', ' Band Shift Mobility Assay ', ' histone modification ', ' DNA Modification Process ', ' DNA Modification ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' DNase-I Footprinting ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vivo ', ' Transcript ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' malignant stem cell ', ' cancer stem cell ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' pluripotency ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,266250,0.02730841031782874
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9435146,R01GM118851,"['Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Environment ', ' Fingers ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Libraries ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Zinc Fingers ', ' Zinc Finger Motifs ', ' Zinc Finger Domain ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' slug ', ' Exposure to ', ' Reporter ', ' scaffold ', ' scaffolding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' exhaustion ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' WT1 gene ', ' Wilms tumor suppressor WT1 ', ' Wilms Tumor 1 ', ' WT33 ', ' WT1 ', ' WAGR ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' model design ', ' DNA Binding ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' DNA Binding Domain ', ' DNA-Binding Protein Motifs ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' user-friendly ', ' loss of function ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' screening ', ' Geometry ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' ']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,393339,0.037679616556468815

"Nascent Adhesion-Based Mechano-transmission for Extracellular Matrix Stiffness Sensing Project Summary Tissue stiffness varies along organs and tissue types, from very soft (e.g. brain) to intermediate (e.g. digestive organs) and to very stiff (e.g. bone). Sensing this stiffness by cells determines differentiation, proliferation, migration and survival, which are all important for development. Local tissue stiffening is a hallmark of cancer, sensing of which by cancer cells causes further tumor progression and metastasis. Understanding stiffness sensing mechanism is thus essential for designing appropriate treatment strategy against developmental disorders and cancer. The prominent “sensor” for mechanical stiffness of tissue environment is a molecular complex located between the cell and the environment, referred to as a focal adhesion. The first step in stiffness sensing is thought to involve transmission of increased level of a force across molecules in the focal adhesion against higher tissue stiffness, but the underlying biomechanical/molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The challenge in investigating this mechanism is in the dynamic nature of its structure, molecular interaction and mechanical forces affecting its assembly. The goal of this work is to understand whether, how and when the focal adhesion during dynamic assembly from their birth starts to be able to transmit the differential forces against varying tissue stiffness levels. Toward this goal, we have developed a set of experimental, microscopic and computational techniques to measure a small force from the adhesions, to profile heterogeneous dynamics of entire adhesion population, and to link molecular activity to force transmission in statistically confident manner. Specifically, we focus on a tiny dot-like complex called “a nascent adhesion”, an early form of the focal adhesion, and involvement of the mechanical linker protein talin, given its ability to be stretched and expose binding sites for other molecules like a vinculin, another mechanical linker protein. The overall objective of this proposal is to use these techniques to test a novel conceptual model of stiffness sensing in which nascent adhesions are sensitive to the tissue stiffness by talin-mediated transmission of force, which promotes further maturation of them to focal adhesions. We will determine if 1) nascent adhesions can transmits differential levels of force in response to varying ECM stiffness, 2) the main source of force actin cytoskeleton- driven and myosin-independent, 3) there is concurrent recruitment of talin and vinculin as a pre-assembled complex and whether it affects force-transmission in response to the ECM stiffness, and 4) competition for talin binding of talin-binding proteins against actin-binding decreases force transmission by nascent adhesion and impair the ECM stiffness sensing. An enhanced mechanistic understanding of these processes would increase our fundamental knowledge of how cells sense and respond to tissue mechanics. Thus, the proposed studies are relevant to the NIH's mission, as they will lead to new insights in physiology and pathophysiology including tissue development, regeneration and cancer progression. Project Narrative Cells’ ability to sense tissue stiffness has a fundamental impact on tissue development and disease progression such as cancer metastasis. The sensing takes place at the interface between the cells and the extracellular matrix via integrin-based adhesions, but our understanding has been limited to sensing by big, mature adhesions. This proposal seeks to test whether tiny, newly-born adhesions can sense tissue stiffness by accurate measurement of mechanical force transmitted through them and recruitment of early adhesion proteins.",Nascent Adhesion-Based Mechano-transmission for Extracellular Matrix Stiffness Sensing,9880640,R15GM135806,"['Actins ', ' Adhesions ', ' Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' bone ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chimera ', ' Chimera organism ', ' intracellular skeleton ', ' Cytoskeletal System ', ' Cellular Matrix ', ' Cytoskeleton ', ' Environment ', ' ECM ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Integrins Extracellular Matrix ', ' Integrins ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mission ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Myosins ', ' Myosin Adenosinetriphosphatase ', ' Myosin Adenosine Triphosphatase ', ' Actin-Activated ATPase ', ' Myosin ATPase ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Physiology ', ' Proteins ', ' regenerate ', ' Regeneration ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Research ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Traction ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' metavinculin ', ' Vinculin ', ' Band 2 Protein ', ' Talin ', ' Mediating ', ' rho GTP-Binding Proteins ', ' rho Small GTP-Binding Proteins ', ' rho Protein P21 ', ' rho GTPases ', ' rho G-Proteins ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' tumor progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' sensor ', ' Microscopic ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' polymerization ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' particle ', ' Stretching ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' cellular engineering ', ' cell engineering ', ' Focal Adhesions ', ' Focal Contacts ', ' Cell-Matrix Adherens Junctions ', ' Adhesion Plaques ', ' developmental disease ', ' developmental disorder ', ' Integrin Binding ', ' integrin bound ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Filamentous Actin ', ' F-Actin ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Subgroup ', ' Computational Technique ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' treatment strategy ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' mechanical force ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' recruit ', ' Traction\xa0Force Microscopy ', ' ']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,414802,0.008551057193876986
"Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We have recently developed novel framework for next-generation quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) designed to meet the challenges of biomolecular simulations and drug discovery applications. QMFFs have tremendous computational advantages relative to their fully QM counterparts, being inherently parallelizable and linearly scaling, offering tremendous computational speedup, and promising quantitative accuracy potentially superior to full QM methods. QMFFs accurately model multipolar electrostatics, charge penetration effects, and non-linear polarization response. QMFFs thus offer a transformative technology for drug discovery applications, in particular, for advancing the predictive capability of free energy simulations in lead reﬁnement. These are critically important for the diverse chemical space of drug molecules, including halogen bonding, cation-  and metal-ligand interactions. Further, QMFFs offer a mechanism for modeling covalent inhibitors. Speciﬁcally, we propose to: I. Develop new QMFFs for drug discovery. QMFFs will be developed based on both semiempirical and ab initio density-functional methods in the following stages: 1) determination of multipolar mapping parameters enhancing the DFTB electrostatic potential to reach greater accuracy, 2) augmentation of electronic response terms using chemical potential equalization (CPE) corrections using an orthogonal perturbation-response approach to solve the under-polarization problem of DFTB methods, 3) parameterization of non-electrostatic non-bonded interac- tion parameters using realistic potentials that capture many-body exchange and dispersion interactions, and 4) exploration of statistical potentials, using machine learning approaches applied to quantum data sets, to correct internal conformational energies and short-range interactions. II. Develop new free energy methods to enable protein-ligand binding predictions using QMFFs. We will develop a novel integrated free energy pipeline to pre- dict alchemical binding free energies for ligands and inhibitors. This will include new GPU-accelerated methods for  -space self-adaptive mixture sampling ( -SAMS) and 2D-vFEP analysis, coupled with conformational space enhanced sampling methods for alchemical steps of the thermodynamic cycle, and advancements in free en- ergy “book-ending” methods (BBQm) to efﬁciently connect molecular mechanical force ﬁeld and QMFF model representations. III. Test and validate QMFFs and free energy methods, and apply to MIF inhibitor binding. The methods will be broadly tested against established data sets for solvation free energies, and a drug discovery data set. More in-depth validation studies will be conducted by examining the relative binding free energies of inhibitors of the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF). Finally, exploratory applications will examine mechanisms, characterize transition states and predict rates for covalent inhibition for a series of MIF inhibitors.

"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites.

"Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology Summary Technological advances such as next-generation sequencing and single-cell analysis have opened the flood gates for RNA analysis, revealing that the transcriptome is significantly more complex than previously thought, both with respect to the diversity of RNA transcripts, their temporal expression dynamics, and their cellular location. Moreover, thousands of dysregulated RNAs have been observed in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These observations underscore the dire need for new molecular tools to precisely dissect RNA function in health and disease. The goal of my research program is to harness the unprecedented power of CRISPR-Cas systems to create a versatile range of methods to precisely manipulate virtually any RNA, and to use these tools to explore fundamental knowledge gaps in RNA biology. This proposal specifically focuses on addressing the following knowledge gaps: 1) Despite the technological advances in harnessing RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzymes Cas9 and Cas13 for research and clinical applications, we still do not understand the principles of gRNA selection for efficient and tunable RNA-targeting. This problem precludes the facile development of a number of RNA-targeting applications and underscores the need for a thorough interrogation of gRNA selection. Our goal here is to develop a model to predict highly-active gRNAs for Cas9/Cas13 RNA- targeting in human cells. We will use a combination of high-throughput RNA:protein interactome methods, flow- cytometry based gRNA screens and machine learning to precisely define features of highly active RNA-targeting gRNAs for RNA-binding and knockdown for Cas9 and Cas13. 2) The vast majority of human RNAs are alternatively spliced, and RNA splicing defects are common in cancers and neurological diseases. However, our understanding of the downstream functional effects of splicing in a majority of cases is rudimentary. To address this issue, we will develop a toolbox of robust, multiplexable Cas-based splicing factors to offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the functional consequences of alternative splicing. that can determine in a single step both the identity of proteins bound to a And 3) There is a paucity of methods specific RNA and their location on that RNA. The development of such an approach will enable us to determine the spatial arrangement of proteins on specific RNAs to dissect their dynamic deposition in range of RNA processes such as transcription, 3ʹ-end and micro-RNA processing, and lncRNA function. To address this issue, we propose to develop a genetically encodable Cas-based RNA proximity-labeling strategy to precisely identify proteins that bind in close proximity to a specific RNA sequence. We will then use this approach to identify protein factors involved in regulating microprocessor (Drosha/DGCR8) activity at specific primary micro-RNA loci. These research goals fully align with the NIGMS 5 Year Strategic Plan, through the development of essential research tools to study and RNA function for biomedical research. Project Narrative RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas proteins offer an unprecedented opportunity to precisely manipulate RNA biology in ways not currently possible. We propose several innovative approaches to address critical knowledge gaps in CRISPR-Cas tool development and chart a path to use these tools to interrogate several fundamental questions in RNA biology. Our approaches will help us define the gRNA design rules for RNA-targeting Cas proteins, and develop robust new RNA-targeting Cas tools to manipulate RNA splicing and dissect protein- RNA interaction networks, and ultimately, the tools developed here will transform the way we study RNA and will broadly impact the fields of molecular and cell biology.",Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology,9796943,R35GM133462,"['BCAR1 ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' NIGMS ', ' RNA-Protein Interaction ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Transcript ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' tool development ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Flooding ', ' Floods ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Methods ', ' Microprocessor ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' gRNA ', ' Guide RNA ', ' RNA Sequences ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' single cell analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' RNA analysis ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' RNA Binding ', ' RNA bound ', ' RNA Processing ', ' BCAR1 gene ', ' p130CAS ', ' p130 cas protein ', ' Cas protein ', ' CRKAS ', ' CRK-Associated Substrate ', ' CKRAS protein ', ' Breast Cancer Anti-Estrogen Resistance 1 Protein ', ' BCAR1 Protein ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R35,2019,385000,0.19092726241230593
"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes Project Summary RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular “hijackers”. For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease. Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9980064,R35GM118070,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biology ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Infection ', ' Learning ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Research ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' virus RNA ', ' viral RNA ', ' Travel ', ' virology ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' macromolecule ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cell Components ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' Protein Biosynthesis ', ' protein synthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Synthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Biosynthesis ', ' Ribosomal Peptide Biosynthesis ', ' structural biology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Molecular ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' Outcome ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' biological systems ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2019,250000,0.1842665286905121
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases No other group of diseases encompasses a greater pathophysiology than do the rheumatic diseases. Spanning multiple organ systems, clinical decisions often rely on coordinated efforts from primary care providers and rheumatologists to rule in or rule out differential diagnoses when treating inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). RA is a symmetric, inflammatory, peripheral polyarthritis leading to deformity of joints via erosion of bone and surrounding cartilage. SLE can affect virtually any organ leading to fatigue, fever, myalgia, weight change and complications associated with renal, central nervous system, and hematologic systems can be life-threatening. RA and SLE are diagnosed through clinical judgment after excluding alternative diagnoses. In the case of both diseases, individual laboratory tests are effective only in a portion of the disease population. Across these analyses, the sensitivity and specificity for these laboratory measurements may have high specificity to rule in SLE but lack sensitivity as these diagnostic markers can be found in other disorders. As a physician colleague pointed out, “it is difficult to diagnose a negative”. Diagnostic approaches for both RA and SLE often rely on multiple, independent laboratory tests combined with clinical observation. Distinguishing between these diseases is important since treatment procedures for these diseases are different. Time is a factor in diagnosis of these diseases and tools are required to facilitate earlier diagnosis as treatment for autoimmune diseases are highly effective and early initiation of therapy leads to the best outcomes. Misdiagnosis of these conditions is not uncommon. Another common disease seen by rheumatologists is fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). FMS is a common cause of widespread musculoskeletal pain that affects tendons, ligaments, and muscle. FMS is difficult to diagnose and treat and a critical clinical point is that FMS is not explained by another rheumatic or systemic disorder. Thus, FMS is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies have been considered and excluded. RA and SLE are two diseases that must be eliminated from the differential diagnosis. Given the complicated diagnostic process these patients are often forced to endure, recent studies have also suggested that healthcare dollars are saved post-diagnosis and patient outcomes improve. To date, there is no laboratory test that can determine presence or absence of these three conditions from a single blood sample.  The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on FMS and the rheumatic diseases as disease categories and have identified and validated FMS and rheumatic disease-associated associated differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include 1) subjects with fibromyalgia syndrome, 2) healthy controls, 3) rheumatoid arthritis, 4) systemic lupus erythematosus, and 5) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S. and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic diseases from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome and other rheumatic diseases can be a difficult, long and costly process and misdiagnosis of these diseases is not uncommon. Biomarkers to aid and accelerate diagnosis is an area of active investigation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test, and supported by our phase 1 studies, is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess greater accuracy to identify fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic disease and provide meaningful clinical information to health- care providers faced with these diagnostic dilemmas.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases,9640388,R44AI129147,"['Affect ', ' Rheumatoid Arthritis ', ' rheumatic arthritis ', ' Atrophic Arthritis ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Cartilaginous Tissue ', ' Cartilage ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Europe ', ' Exhibits ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' febris ', ' febrile ', ' Pyrexia ', ' Fever ', ' myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome ', ' fibromyalgia syndrome ', ' Muscular Rheumatism ', ' MPD syndrome ', ' Fibrositis ', ' Fibromyositis-Fibromyalgia Syndrome ', ' Diffuse Myofascial Pain Syndrome ', ' Fibromyalgia ', ' Genes ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Hematology ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Invertebrata ', ' Invertebrates ', ' Joints ', ' Judgment ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' Laboratories ', ' Ligaments ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE - Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' SLE ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Sharp Syndrome ', ' Mixed Connective Tissue Disease ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Rheumatologic Disorder ', ' Rheumatic Diseases ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain Disorder ', ' Rheumatism ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Tendons ', ' Tendon structure ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' vertebrata ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Work ', ' Research Subjects ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Polyarthritides ', ' polyarthritis ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Procedures ', ' Peripheral ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Myalgia ', ' Myosalgia ', ' Myoneuralgia ', ' Myodynia ', ' Myalgic ', ' Muscle sorenesss ', ' Muscle pain/fibrositis ', ' Muscle pain ', ' Muscle discomfort ', ' Aching muscles ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Deformity ', ' Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Whole Blood ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' body system ', ' Organ System ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' cohort ', ' Exclusion ', ' Geographic Distribution ', ' Categories ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Process ', "" Sjogren's Syndrome "", ' Sjögren Syndrome ', ' Sjogrens ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' human disease ', ' rheumatologist ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' bone erosion ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' improved outcome ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' ']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2019,464162,0.053070921413887334
"Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries Our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and structure-based design of drugs for treatment, rely on experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins and other macromolecules complexed with small molecule ligands. Many of these structures have direct relevance to public health, especially complexes of drug targets with drugs, inhibitors, substrates, or allosteric effectors. Yet, structure-based drug discovery is severely complicated and hindered by experimental bias and the shortcomings of current methods of experimental ligand identification, which often result in misidentified, missing, or misplaced ligands. The propagation of erroneous structures combined with an increased accessibility to structural data not only thwarts reproducibility in biomedical research and drug discovery, but also diverts valuable resources down doomed research avenues. We will leverage our extensive experience validating and refining ligand binding sites to generate ligand reference libraries that will be made publically available on a new web resource dedicated to the interaction of small molecules and macromolecules. These libraries can be used in many downstream applications, such as drug design, computational chemistry, biology, and bioinformatics. We will utilize recent technological advances in machine learning in conjunction with existing tools to create a standardized protocol for density interpretation and unbiased, reproducible ligand identification. This pipeline will not only be able identify and model ligands in unassigned density fragments, but also be able to detect and correct suboptimally refined ligands in existing structures. As the proposed AI will be free from cognitive bias, it should alleviate the most severe problems in structure-based drug design. Because improperly interpreted structures can have a significant deleterious ripple effect, we will experimentally verify select biomedically important structures with dubious experimental support for critical small molecules using use X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy. This proposal addresses current shortcomings of ligand identification in experimentally determined structures through a combination of novel machine learning algorithms and existing validation mechanisms. The main deliverables are 1) curated libraries of validated ligand binding sites and the tools used to produce the libraries and 2) a machine learning assisted pipeline for the interpretation of density fragments corresponding to small molecules within macromolecular structures.

"The next generation of RNA-Seq simulators for benchmarking analyses Abstract: RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) has established itself as the primary method for studying transcription in basic research, with an emerging role in the clinic – currently upwards of 5,000 publications using the technology are indexed in PubMed. However, the interpretation of RNA-Seq requires several complex operations including alignment, quantification, normalization and statistical analyses of various types. Since its inception a large number of algorithms have appeared for each step, creating a very confusing landscape for investigators. In order to determine the best analysis practices, numerous benchmarking studies have emerged which leverage real RNA-Seq data made from well-studied RNA samples, such as the Genetic European Variation in Health and Disease (GEUVADIS) consortium data. These valuable RNA-Seq datasets contain the biases and errors introduced by sequencing biochemistry—factors that any analysis method must account for and overcome. However, the utility of such datasets for benchmarking analysis methods is limited by the fact that we do not know the underlying truth (e.g. the true number of RNA molecules from each transcript in the original sample). Therefore researchers tend to rely heavily on simulated data, since we know everything about the true composition of these samples. There are dozens of DNA simulators aimed at benchmarking applications such as variant calling. And while the need for simulators is just as strong in RNA analysis, there are only a scant few RNA-Seq simulators available. Furthermore, the available RNA- Seq simulators are based on simplifying assumptions that greatly restrict their utility for benchmarking anything but the most upstream steps in the analysis pipeline (e.g. alignment). The further downstream the analysis method is, the more accurately the true nature of real data and its technical biases need to be modeled in order to draw meaningful conclusions. For example, no simulator generates data from a diploid genome, which would be necessary to evaluate allele specific quantification. Given our extensive experience with RNA-Seq analysis and transcriptomics in general, and our success at building the BEERS simulator, and our track record of authorship on all comprehensive RNA-Seq aligner benchmarking studies published to date, we are ideally situated to develop the next generation of open-source RNA-Seq simulator which aims to model all sources of technical variability. Furthermore, the simulator will model biological variability with an empirical approach based on using real data to configure the simulator’s parameters, which is a natural problem for machine learning. There are eleven steps in RNA-Seq library preparation which introduce bias, all of which will be modeled by the software in an object-oriented modular framework. Project Narrative: There have been many algorithms developed for every step of the RNA-Seq analysis pipeline with no easy way to compare between them. Simulated data are useful for this purpose, but to date there are very few RNA-Seq simulators available and all make too many simplifying assumptions to be used for anything but the most upstream steps in the pipeline, e.g. alignment. We propose to develop the next generation of open-source RNA-Seq simulator, which will capture all of the biochemical processes in a modular fashion and model all of the sources of technical variation.",The next generation of RNA-Seq simulators for benchmarking analyses,9730605,R21LM012763,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Authorship ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Diploid ', ' Diploidy ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' DNA-Dependent DNA Polymerases ', ' DNA Polymerases ', ' DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' In Vitro ', ' indexing ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Artifacts ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' European ', ' analog ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Source ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' experience ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Isoforms ', ' success ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' RNA analysis ', ' Guanine + Cytosine Composition ', ' Guanine + Cytosine Content ', ' GC Content ', ' GC Composition ', ' G+C Content ', ' G+C Compositions ', ' PubMed ', ' Biochemical Process ', ' Biochemical Reaction ', ' Enzymatic Reaction ', ' Data ', ' Sequencing Biochemistry ', ' Transcript ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' digital ', ' biochemical model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' open source ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' operation ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' power analysis ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,181125,0.032931584958980444
"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9753272,R35GM118070,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biology ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Infection ', ' Learning ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Research ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' virus RNA ', ' viral RNA ', ' Travel ', ' virology ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' macromolecule ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cell Components ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' Protein Biosynthesis ', ' protein synthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Synthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Biosynthesis ', ' Ribosomal Peptide Biosynthesis ', ' structural biology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Molecular ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' Outcome ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' biological systems ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2019,618108,0.1842665286905121
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,9774233,R01GM123314,"['Algorithms ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Exons ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Maps ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Ribonucleoproteins ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Running ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' protein profiling ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' K562 Cells ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' RNA Binding ', ' RNA bound ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' protein expression ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Protein Binding Domain ', ' Protein-Protein Interaction Domain ', ' Protein Binding Motif ', ' RNA-Protein Interaction ', ' Computational Technique ', ' K-562 ', ' K562 blasts ', ' K562 ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' RNA Recognition Motif ', ' RNP-1 Signature ', ' RNP Motif ', ' RNP Domain ', ' RNA Binding Domain ', ' Putative RNA-Binding Region ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' deep sequencing ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' computer studies ', ' computational studies ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' user-friendly ', ' human disease ', ' comparative ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' MALAT1 gene ', ' metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 ', ' MALAT1 ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' HepG2 ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' Hep G2 ', ' crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing ', ' High-throughput sequencing of CLIP cDNA library ', ' HITS-CLIP ', ' CLIP-Seq ', ' predictive tools ', ' online resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' web resource ', ' online compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' internet resource ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' ']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2019,303137,0.13268414676822698
"Probing transcriptional activation at the molecular level Project abstract Much of the assembly process of the transcription machinery is governed by transient and dynamic protein‐ protein interactions (PPIs) that defy standard characterization strategies. Transcriptional coactivators are the hubs of this process, interacting with transcriptional activators, epigenetic modulators, the polymerase, and other coactivators to assemble the transcriptional machine. Coactivators also represent a central molecular recognition conundrum, as the mechanisms by which they interact with such a diverse array with binding partners and the influence of local binding interactions on longer‐range structural and functional trajectories. In the previous funding period, we developed a molecular recognition model that addresses the first part of the conundrum. Here will build on this model to discover allosteric modulators of coactivators previously labelled undruggable despite their central functional roles. Additionally, we will answer the latter half of the conundrum to develop a comprehensive model of molecular recognition in transcriptional coactivator function. Project narrative Transcription is dysregulated in every human disease as either a cause or an effect and as such represents a potentially powerful intervention point for therapeutics; a significant impediment to progress are the many questions regarding the complex network of protein‐protein interactions that regulates this process.

"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature.

"Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins Project Summary Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to the precision treatment of disease. When high resolution structures of a protein are available, and many isoforms of the protein have been connected to dif- fering binding preferences, it is possible in principle to model the structures of all isoforms and discover the mechanisms that cause variations in binding preferences. Unfortunately, this discovery process depends on human expertise for examining molecular structure, and given that hundreds of isoforms may exist, a human would be overwhelmed to objectively examine many similar isoforms. To fill this gap, this project will (A1) de- velop software that identifies structural mechanisms that cause differential binding preferences, categorizes similar structural mechanisms, and explains the mechanisms in English. The second aim of this project (A2) is to validate the software at a large scale on families of proteins that exhibit a variety of well-examined binding preferences, and through blind predictions with experimental collaborators. Our approach involves creating software that mimics the visual reasoning techniques employed by structural biologists when examining molecular structures. Not only are these techniques responsible for most major dis- coveries in structural biology, but they are also straightforward to understand by non-computational research- ers. This property will enable our software to immediately integrate into existing workflows at labs that do not focus on computational methods. This property also contrasts from existing methods, which generally output structural models, potential energies, p-values and structural scores which are difficult for non-experts to un- derstand or incorporate into their research. Often, an expert in biophysics is required to interpret the outputs so that they can be operationalized in laboratory environments. In preliminary results, our methods have already identified molecular mechanisms that govern specificity in several families of proteins. Verification against peer-reviewed experimentation has proven the preliminary results correct in almost all cases. Our methods have also been applied to make a blind prediction of binding mechanisms in the ricin toxin, which binds to and damages the human ribosome. With experimental collabo- rators, we showed that our methods correctly identified and predicted the roles of several amino acids with a hitherto unknown role in recognizing the ribosome. Using our methodological approach and our rigorous valida- tion strategy, this project will produce a highly validated, usable software package that will bridge a critical gap in the development of precision therapies and diagnostics. Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to precision medicine and precise diagnostics. We will develop software that will identify and categorize molecular mechanisms that cause these variations.

"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood.

"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases.

"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs).

"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is entitled “Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning.” A number of in- terrelated computational methods for making predictions about the biological behavior of small molecules have been the subject of development within the Jain Laboratory for over twenty years. These share a common strat- egy that considers molecular interactions at their surface interface, where proteins and ligands actually interact. These methods yield measurements of similarity between small molecules or between protein binding pockets. They also yield measurements of the complementarity of a small molecule to a protein binding site (the molecular docking problem). A generalization of these concepts makes possible the construction of a virtual binding site for quantitative activity prediction purely from data about the biological activities of a set of small molecules.  The goals of the proposed work include further improving the accuracy and breadth of applicability of the binding site modeling approach. The primary application of the approach is to guide optimization of leads within medicinal chemistry projects, and to quantify potential off-target effects during pre-clinical drug discovery.  A critical focus of the work will be in data and software dissemination, in order to accelerate the efficient development of targeted therapies. In addition to methods development, the proposed work will involve broad application of these state-of-the-art predictive modeling methods. The proposed work will proceed with the col- laborative input of our pharmaceutical industry colleagues, who have specialized knowledge and data sets that are vital for cutting-edge work in computer-aided drug design.  The expected results include more efficient lead optimization (fewer compounds to reach desired biological pa- rameters), truly effective scaffold replacement (to move away from a molecular series with biological limitations), and improved computational predictions of off-target effects during pre-clinical drug design. Project Narrative This project seeks to refine an integrated platform for physically realistic prediction of ligand binding affinities using multiple methods that span small molecule molecular similarity, molecular docking, and protein binding site similarity. These tools will provide predictive modeling unrestrained by scaffold congruence between what is known and what is to be predicted. Prediction of bioactive molecular poses and activities to guide lead optimiza- tion and to quantify off-target liability effects are applications of the effort, and data and software will be made widely available to academic and industrial research groups.",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,9670817,R01GM101689,"['Behavior ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Charge ', ' Pharmaceutic Chemistry ', ' Medicinal Chemistry ', ' Pharmaceutical Chemistry ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmaceutical Industry ', ' Pharmaceutic Industry ', ' Drug Industry ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' H-bond ', ' Hydrogen Bonding ', ' Industrialization ', ' Laboratories ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Molecular Probes ', ' Physics ', ' Protein Conformation ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Surface ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Chemicals ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' scaffold ', ' scaffolding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Electrostatics ', ' Knowledge ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' physical model ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' drug discovery ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' protein structure ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Industry Collaboration ', ' Industry Collaborators ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Docking ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' virtual ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' treatment fees ', ' treatment charges ', ' charges for treatment ', ' blind ', ' combinatorial ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Formulation ', ' Structural Protein ', ' lead optimization ', ' ']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,310202,0.03535836793375995
"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease.

"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer.

"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases. When transcription factors function they produce eRNAs.

"Integrative miRNA data analysis for clinical cancer genomics PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed research has two broad, long-term objectives. First, it seeks to shift medical practice toward more personalized treatments, by applying innovative methods to analyze and integrate DNA, RNA and protein data generated by a large network of GDAN researchers in a miRNA-centric framework. Analyses will identify cancer subtypes, and individual patients within a subtype, in which alterations in the expression of certain miRNAs influence cancer pathogenesis and drug response. Second, the proposed research seeks to shift cancer genomics research by allowing a diverse group of cancer researchers to flexibly access and use the project’s cancer genomics data, and microRNA-centric results and methods, through a cloud computing framework. The proposed research has three specific aims: 1) Build a computational pipeline for processing and analysis of miRNA data, 2) Elucidate the regulation of and by miRNAs through integrative analysis, and 3) Delineate the role of miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment using predictive modeling. Research design and methods: 1) Processing and analysis of miRNA data. We will process total RNA sequence data to identify expressed miRNAs, and extend the current processing pipeline to identify potentially functional miRNA sequence variants. We will apply our miRNA-centric analyses developed for The Cancer Genome Atlas project to identify: subtypes within a cancer, miRNAs that are associated with survival, miRNA targeting effects on gene and protein expression, and cis-effects of copy number and DNA methylation on miRNA abundances. 2) Regulation of and by miRNAs. Collaborating within the research network, we will extend our analysis methods to take into account additional datatypes and functional contexts that influence how miRNAs are regulated, and how they regulate genes and their products. 3) Predictive modeling. As the research network will have detailed clinical data and multiplatform genomic data, we will apply machine learning algorithms in a novel context to key sets of genes, proteins and miRNAs that predict clinical outcomes like survival and drug response. 4) Cloud computing. We will make our data, analysis methods and results readily available to a broad group of researchers within a cloud computing framework.

"Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation PROJECT SUMMARY  Studies are proposed to dissect one of the fundamental, binary development decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. The nematode C. elegans determines sex with remarkable precision by tallying X- chromosome number relative to the sets of autosomes (X:A signal): ratios of 1X:2A (0.5) and 2X:3A (0.67) signal male fate, while ratios of 3X:4A (0.75) and 2X:2A (1.0) signal hermaphrodite fate. We have discovered much about the nature and action of the X:A signal and its direct target, a master sex-determination-switch gene that also controls X-chromosome dosage compensation. However, a fundamental question remains: how is the signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? We pioneer new methods using machine learning neural networks to address this question with single-molecule and single-cell resolution. We also propose to dissect the functional interplay between chromatin modification and chromosome structure in regulating gene expression over vast chromosomal territories. X-chromosome dosage compensation in C. elegans is exemplary for this analysis: we found recently that dosage-compensated X chromosomes have (i) elevated levels of modified histone H4K20me1 compared to autosomes and (ii) a unique three-dimensional architecture. Both are imposed by the dosage compensation complex (DCC). Loss of H4K20me1 disrupts 3D architecture and elevates X gene expression. In the nematode DCC, one subunit is an H4K20me2 demethylase and five subunits are homologs of condensin subunits, which compact and resolve mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. All DCC subunits are recruited specifically to hermaphrodite X chromosomes by an XX-specific subunit that triggers binding to cis- acting regulatory elements on X (rex) to reduce gene expression by half. The DCC remodels the structure of X into topologically associating domains (TADs) using its highest affinity rex sites to establish domain boundaries. Despite this knowledge, important questions underlying the mechanisms of dosage compensation remain. What DCC subunits recognize the X-enriched motifs in rex sites to bind X directly? How does the DCC regulate RNA polymerase II to repress gene expression? What mechanisms underlie H4K20me1's control of chromosome structure, and how does DCC-mediated higher-order structure affect gene expression? Our findings should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state. Lastly, we will exploit our unexpected finding that rex sites have diverged across Caenorhabditis species separated by 30 MYR, retaining no functional overlap despite strong conservation of the core DCC machinery. This divergence provides an unusual opportunity to study the path for a concerted co- evolutionary change in hundreds of target sites across X chromosomes and the protein complexes that bind them. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our work dissects one of the fundamental, binary developmental decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. While we have discovered detailed molecular mechanisms about the nature and action of the signal that determines sex in the nematode C. elegans and its direct target, a critical question remains that we address: how is the sex signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? Our work also explores the functional interplay between chromosome structure, chromatin modification, and long-distance regulation of gene expression by studying X- chromosome dosage compensation. The nematode dosage compensation complex, a condensin complex, equalizes X-chromosome gene expression between the sexes by imposing a unique three-dimensional architecture onto hermaphrodite X chromosomes and by catalyzing enrichment of the modified histone H4K20me1 through a subunit that is a H4K20me2 histone demethylase. Results from exploring the connection between higher-order chromosome structure and chromatin modification should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state.",Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation,9699752,R35GM131845,"['Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Bacteria ', ' Caenorhabditis ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Dosage Compensation ', ' Dosage Compensation (Genetics) ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Switch Genes ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Intersexuality ', ' Hermaphroditism ', ' Histones ', ' male ', ' Mammalia ', ' Mammals ', ' meiotic ', ' Meiosis ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' roundworm ', ' Nematodes ', ' Nematoda ', ' RNA Polymerase B ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase II ', ' RNA Polymerase II ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Work ', ' X Chromosome ', ' X-Chromosome Inactivation ', ' Lyonization ', ' X Inactivation ', ' Mediating ', ' Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' C.elegans ', ' C. elegans ', ' C elegans ', ' dosage ', ' tumor progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' autosome ', ' Structure ', ' Chromosome Structures ', ' Chromosome Organization ', ' Chromosomal Structure ', ' Chromosomal Organization ', ' single molecule ', ' condensin ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' protein complex ', ' sex determination ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Structure ', ' Higher Order Structure ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Folding ', ' Mitotic ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Chromosome Territory ', ' Chromosomal Territory ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' histone demethylase ', ' recruit ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R35,2019,466290,0.014761783909813201
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,9684634,R35GM127040,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Goals ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Work ', ' Tertiary Protein Structure ', ' Protein Domains ', ' Peptide Domain ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Biological ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Molecular Models ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' drug development ', ' drug discovery ', ' mimetics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' small molecule ', ' Length ', ' Affinity ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' therapeutic target ', ' screening ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2019,297553,0.05545355635883443
"Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq. PROJECT ABSTRACT Deciphering how complex programs of gene expression and regulation contribute to human disease is one of the major challenges facing the field of genomics. Over the past decade, a wealth of new high-throughput genomics tools have revolutionized how we identify active genomic regions and appear poised to make great strides in understanding the mechanisms of disease. Yet the application of most of these technologies has been limited to established cell lines. Currently, approaches being developed to comprehensively map functional elements across the genome involve combining data from several different genome-wide experimental assays, making them expensive and impractical to use in clinical isolates of limited quantity or even to analyze new cell lines. Compounding these technical difficulties, gene expression is a complex and highly tissue dependent biological process, and many important applications will require the direct interrogation of clinical isolates or other similarly limited sources of sample. Thus, efficient new tools that map the repertoire of functional elements across the genome are likely to transform the biomedical and clinical sciences.  We propose to develop Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing (ChRO-seq) and a suite of computational tools for mapping transcription directly in limited tissue samples. Our approach uses a single genome-wide molecular assay to efficiently identify the location of promoters and enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, gene and lincRNA boundaries, transcription levels, and impute certain histone modifications. Preliminary ChRO-seq data reveals patterns of transcription that are virtually identical to those using Precision Run on and Sequencing in cultured cells, but can easily be applied in solid tissue samples. We applied our preliminary ChRO-seq technology to several primary tumors, revealing new insights into how transcriptional regulation underlies cancer development and progression, and providing a key proof-of-concept motivating further technology development. We anticipate that ChRO-seq and the computational methods proposed will enable the efficient discovery of functional elements in virtually any cell sample. In addition, ChRO-seq has the unique advantage that it can be applied in limited tissue samples and clinical isolates even after the degradation of mRNA. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a suite of molecular and computational technologies that allow researchers to directly measure transcriptional regulation of genes, enhancers, and lincRNAs in limited clinical isolates.

"Enhancer-mediated mechanisms of pattern formation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene regulatory networks establish the body plans of complex multicellular animals. The main components of these networks are transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that contain unique combinations of transcription factor binding sites. Transgenic experiments have shown that CREs control spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression, but how binding events at the CRE level are converted into these patterns is still poorly understood. In humans, mutations that disrupt transcription factor activit or CRE DNA sequences can cause birth defects and disease states, including cancer. Here we propose to study CRE- mediated embryo patterning in the early Drosophila embryo, with a specific focus on CREs that respond to the maternal transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd). In previous work, we identified 66 Bcd-dependent CREs, which were validated by reporter genes in transgenic embryos. All 66 are directly activated by Bcd, but each contains a unique set of transcription factor-binding sites, and drives an expression pattern that appears as a band(s) or stripe(s) at a specific position(s) along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis. Expression pattern boundaries represent positions where genes make on/off decisions, and foreshadow boundaries between cells of different fates later in development. The work proposed here will focus on two major goals. First, we want to perform a deep, quantitative analysis of transcriptional activation by a single ""model"" CRE (hunchback P2E) that is activated by BCD. Two specific questions will be addressed: 1. how do individual binding sites, groups of binding sites, and combinations of sites for different factors contribute to transcriptional activation? We will combine DNA-binding data of different types to better define functional motifs, extensively mutate the CRE, and assay three specific output parameters using live imaging in close collaboration with Thomas Gregor's lab. 2. How does this Bcd-dependent CRE ""choose"" its specific basal promoter? We will use a split reporter system and single molecule FISH to identify basal promoter sequences that allow or prevent activation by Bcd, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to test the importance of promoter choice in vivo. The second major goal will be to gain a conceptually complete understanding of the regulatory network that creates Bcd-dependent gene expression patterns. We have identified three proteins that function in broad activation, and nine candidate repressors expressed in discrete domains that together cover the entire embryonic region where activation can occur. We will use reporter gene manipulations and single molecule FISH to test how repressor gradients shape boundaries of gene expression, and genetics and reporter genes to test the roles of several newly identified repressors that prevent activation in anterior regions. Our hypothesis is that the expression patterns driven by all Bcd-dependent CREs are ""computed"" by specific combinations of binding sites for these twelve factors. These experiments will make significant contributions to our general understanding of how CREs functions in activation and repression events, and how embryos establish body plans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Animal body plans are established by hundreds of DNA-binding factors that bind thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs).

"Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling PROJECT SUMMARY The human body comprises of trillion of cells, which are the building blocks of life. Each cell is highly organized, with various constituents within localizing to specific regions. Location within a cell is a cardinal organizing principle of gene control and function, especially for RNAs that code for proteins or serve regulatory roles as non-coding RNAs. Each cell type has its distinct RNA-species profile, and where these RNAs are located within the cell can dictate their folding, editing, splicing, translation, degradation, binding partners, catalytic activity, and even the fate of the proteins that they encode. Unsurprisingly, perturbations in RNA localization result in disease conditions including cancers and neuropathologies. In spite of the vital importance of subcellular RNA localization in gene expression, investigating such phenomena simultaneously for many RNA species has been challenging. To address these long-standing issues, Dr. Furqan Fazal and others have recently developed a technique called APEX-seq that can track the location of thousands of RNAs in living human cells with high-temporal and nanometer-spatial resolution. APEX-seq has the transformative potential to provide high-resolution snapshots of tens of thousands of endogenous cellular RNA species, free from artifacts of overexpression, cell fixation or recombinant tagging. This proposal outlines a five-year career program for Dr. Fazal as he investigates principles of RNA subcellular localization, and reaches milestone goals that will transition him into an independent investigator. By improving the APEX-seq technique and amalgamating it with a number of cutting-edge tools including massively-parallel reporter assays and deep-learning-based approaches, Dr. Fazal will dissect how sequences within RNAs direct them to different locations, and how cells actively control RNA subcellular localization to regulate gene function. This work will be carried out at Stanford University, where Dr. Fazal will be mentored by Dr. Howard Chang, a pioneer in developing new genomics tools, and Dr. Joanna Wysocka, a leading authority in vertebrate development and non-coding genomic regulatory elements. Both mentors have highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions around the nation and world. Additional support will be available through collaboration with Drs. Shen, Boettiger and Kundaje who will provide training and expertise in genetics, imaging, statistics and computation. An advisory committee comprising of world-leading investigators Drs. Ting, Kool, Li, Bryant and Bassik will also monitor progress and provide expertise. Further acquisition of scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the educational resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. Stanford provides an outstanding intellectually-stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success, and all proposed training will complement Dr. Fazal’s previous knowledge in genomics and biophysics and facilitate his transition into a multidisciplinary RNA biologist in the field of spatial transcriptomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many RNA species within a cell are spatially localized and locally translated into proteins, and previous studies in embryos, neurons and highly-dynamic tissues have demonstrated the vital importance of RNA subcellular location in development and cellular function. However, it has been challenging to study localization transcriptome-wide, which has hampered understanding of the extent and role of such processes in normal and diseased tissues. The proposed work will improve a newly-developed tool for the RNA community to investigate spatial transcriptomics, and use it to provide new insights into RNA biology by determining the regulatory sequences (i.e. the grammar) controlling localization, as well as identifying the associated cellular mechanisms.",Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity

"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs. RNA structure is detrimental to RNA function and regulatory element activity. Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops. This will allow him to learn innovative and effective ways to teach biology and progress to become a well- rounded scientist and mentor. Dr. Beaudoin existing expertise and the scientific and training plans of this proposal will allow him to reaching his long-term career goal: to establish a research program to understand the role of RNA structures and RNA helicases in vertebrate development. Defective RNA helicases have been associated to dozens of human diseases (e.g. infertility, neurological disorders, cancers and aging). Therefore, their molecular characterization in a relevant vertebrate model will provide invaluable insights to develop new human therapeutic approaches. Dr. Beaudoin is fully committed to obtain an appointment as a tenure track junior faculty in academia. It is fully expected that Dr. Beaudoin will be competitive for such group leader appointments at the completion of his K99/R00 Award tailored to enhance his scientific and mentoring skills. NARRATIVE  Every animal's life starts by a drastic and controlled remodeling of gene expression following the fertilization of the egg by the sperm. Interestingly, I have developed new tools to study the controllers mediating this essential transfer of information.

"Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines Peptides bound to class I HLA molecules (HLA-A, -B and –C) arise from endogenous or foreign proteins that are cleaved by the proteasome and peptidases of the endoplasmic reticulum prior to loading and display by surface HLA class I proteins. Each HLA allele is estimated to bind and present ~1,000-10,000 unique peptides to T cells. Given such diversity in HLA binding, an important question is whether we can predict whether a particular peptide is likely to bind to a specific HLA allele. Indeed, peptide-binding rules have been long-studied extensively for a subset of HLA alleles and encoded in advanced neural network-based algorithms that predict binding. Historically, little attention has been paid to HLA-C because of its perceived lower surface expression and hence predictive algorithms of HLA-C are very much lacking, as only a few thousand peptides epitopes have been reported in databases. New studies, however, suggests that important epitopes can arise from HLA-C, and have been detected for HIV, EBV, CMV and influenza. Our hypothesis is that large-scale datasets of endogenous HLA bound peptides can improve prediction of binding, and that through applying such an approach to HLA-C, a substantial increase in numbers of actionable immunogenic targets on tumor cells can be gained. Recently, I spearheaded a successful effort to integrate my expertise in experimental workflows for the isolation of HLA-bound peptides with newly available innovations in analysis and instrumentation for mass spectrometry (MS) to create a high throughput MS-based approach for the physical detection of peptides directly displayed by HLA molecules. This workflow and analytic framework now provides an exciting opportunity to generate high-quality data to directly address these challenges. In Aim 1, to systematically identify HLA-C binding peptides, we will use MS to provide experimentally-derived datasets of peptides from 21 HLA-C alleles to provide 99.9% global population coverage. In Aim 2, to define the rules of processing and presentation across HLA-C de novo, we will discover the binding motifs of the HLA-C peptides and use this information to develop predictive algorithms, which we will validate using independent datasets. In Aim 3, we seek to determine if predicted tumor neoepitopes are physically detected on patient tumor cells. We will perform experimental validation of HLA-C prediction algorithms directly on tumor samples available from study subjects enrolled on high-priority clinical trials of personalized neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccines at DFCI using a new nano-scale MS-based analysis. We will confirm the immunogenicity of the detected HLA-C epitopes through in vitro T cell assays using banked peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from study subjects. We anticipate the proposed studies to enable fuller understanding HLA-C epitope presentation, more robust prediction of HLA-C peptide epitopes, and expansion of the spectrum of actionable immune targets. Immune recognition of short peptides representative of proteins within a cell in conjunction with a group of surface molecules called HLA is essential for the process of immune reactivity but characterization of the properties of how these peptides bind to HLA molecules has been constrained by the limited available information about these peptides. We have developed a new high-throughput approach to rapidly isolate thousands of HLA-bound peptides directly from informative cell lines and tumor samples (from patients with melanoma, glioblastoma and renal cell cancer) and to use this information to develop novel algorithms to predict binding of peptides to HLA. We anticipate the proposed studies t o enable fuller understanding of how a subset of understudied HLA molecules (i.e. HLA-C) interact with their binding peptides, to improve prediction of HLA-C bound peptides, and to expand the spectrum of actionable immune targets.",Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer

Transfer learning approaches for integration of single cell RNA sequencing data from multiple sources Project Summary Neurobiology and Neurooncology are challenging fields of study due to the complexity of the brain as an organ as well as the difficulty in attaining human samples of brain tissue. These challenges have increasingly been addressed by the use of mouse models and molecular profiling that have uncovered complex sets of cell types. Fundamentally all cell types contain the same DNA but can be stratified by their RNA profile. This approach has taken advantage of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) which allows for single cells to be measured individually and for many cell types to be uncovered. In the past 5 years these experiments have become ever more prolific with large numbers of labeled datasets of single cells. These datasets can be used to explore a variety of questions involving the stratification of cell types to the distribution of these cell types in tissue. One of the most promising areas is the use of these cell types to better understand tumor heterogeneity and response to treatment. A promising avenue to leverage these diverse datasets for the study of heterogeneity is Transfer Learning. Transfer Learning is the subfield of Machine Learning that applies information learned from source data to target data to generate more generalizable or accurate models. We will develop methods to combine datasets into more robust models of tissue heterogeneity using transfer learning in both normal and Glioblastoma brain. These models can be used to predict clinical outcomes and study unique cellular relationships between datasets. Project Narrative The brain is a very complex organ with a wide variety of cell types -- the more granular of which have just recently been uncovered. We develop transfer-learning methods to integrate multiple datasets across species and disease states to glean information that will improve our understanding of the brain at the cellular level. We reframe Glioblastoma's genetic associations to survival as mixtures of quantifiable cell types effectively eliminating the “curse of dimensionality” via semi-supervised transfer-learning.,Transfer learning approaches for integration of single cell RNA sequencing data from multiple sources,9683171,F31LM013056,"['Atlases ', ' Systematic Bias ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Environment ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Methods ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Patients ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Research ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Standardization ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' training transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' Measures ', ' Glean ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Brain Glioblastoma ', ' Grade IV Brain Astrocytoma ', ' Grade IV Brain Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Brain Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Brain Glioblastoma Multiforme ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' brain tissue ', ' Outcome Study ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Stratification ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Outcome ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' tumor ', ' neuro-oncology ', ' neurooncology ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' clinically actionable ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' tumor heterogeneity ', ' intratumor heterogeneity ', ' intra-tumoral heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneity in tumors ', ' Intratumoral heterogeneity ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NLM,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,33283,0.02841333448586533
"Systematic, Genome-Scale Functional Characterization of Conserved smORFs PROJECT SUMMARY Short peptides (10-100aa) are important regulators of physiology, development and metabolism, however their detection is difficult due to size and abundance. A stunning 30% of annotated human smORF genes include disease-associated variants mapped within exons, compared to 15% of human genes in general. Further, many smORFs are conserved across the entire metazoan phylogeny from invertebrates to vertebrates including man. These ultra-conserved functional smORF genes we call the Conserved smORF Catalog or CSC. These genes have been conserved across more than 500myr of evolution, and yet we know almost nothing at all about their functions. Due to a century of genetic analysis, the genome of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster has the most complete functional annotation among metazoans. Functional annotations derived from Drosophila have been instrumental in hypothesis-based drug development for more than thirty years, and more recently have made possible the biological interpretation of hundreds of SNPs detected in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Hence, functional annotations derived in fly for conserved genes are transferable to human and are of direct clinical relevance. Remarkably, less than 10% of smORFs in Drosophila have been studied functionally, or experimentally verified as generating peptides. A combination of genome engineering, computational, molecular, and functional studies will be used to systematically and comprehensively characterize the CSC, representing the first genome-scale characterization of smORFs in any organism providing a wealth of information on the biological functions of this poorly studied class of proteins. In total, we will characterize and functionally annotate ~400 conserved smORFs using CRISPR knockout followed by phenotyping and rescue assays. We will assess the phenotypes of the mutants, measuring viability, morphology, fecundity and fertility, lifespan, metabolism (sugar and lipid levels), and a number of behavioral phenotypes. For smORFs with robust phenotypes, we will then attempt to rescue a subset of these mutants in three ways: first, by inserting the whole deleted RNA; second, with a version of the RNA with the smORF(s) removed by the addition a stop codon; and lastly, using a micro- construct containing only the smORF and the endogenous promoter. We will generate direct evidence for translation using tagged expression analysis and targeted MS/MS to scan for predicted polypeptides in the whole embryo and tissue dissection samples. In addition to validating the existence of the predicted molecules, this dataset will provide a foundational gold standard for further development of tools for the computational prediction of functional micropeptides. These studies are directed toward the understanding of basic life processes and lay the foundation for promoting better human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE As a public resource, our studies will combine genome-scale phenotyping with detailed functional characterization that will assess the effects of evolutionary conserved small open reading frames (smORFs) on animal viability, development, fecundity, metabolism, longevity and behavior. We will apply state-of-the art methods in Ribosomal profiling, CRISPR genome engineering and targeted mass spectrometry together with the development of new computational tools and analyses to generate a foundational gold standard dataset for the study of smORFs and the prediction of functional smORFs in genome annotation. Many of the genes encoding these molecules have been found to play important roles in human diseases such as neurodegeneration, developmental disorders and cancer.","Systematic, Genome-Scale

"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes Project Summary RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular “hijackers”. For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease. Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9748722,R35GM118070,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biology ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Infection ', ' Learning ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Research ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' virus RNA ', ' viral RNA ', ' Travel ', ' virology ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' macromolecule ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cell Components ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' Protein Biosynthesis ', ' protein synthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Synthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Biosynthesis ', ' Ribosomal Peptide Biosynthesis ', ' structural biology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Molecular ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' Outcome ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' biological systems ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2019,32558,0.1842665286905121
"UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The simplest conceptual model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. In this “independent action model”, if the TF has an activation domain, it activates the genes whose promoters it binds; if it has a repression domain, it represses the genes whose promoters it binds. It is remarkable then, that in existing, comprehensive data sets, that the vast majority of genes whose promoters are bound by a TF show no change in expression when the TF is knocked down or knocked out. In yeast data where all TFs have been analyzed, only 3-5% of bound genes respond when the TF is knocked out; in more recent, but less comprehensive human data it is rarely more than 15%. Furthermore, nearly every TF appears to activate some of the genes it binds while repressing others. These data show that we do not have a credible rough draft map of the regulatory logic of any eukaryote, as most of the genes bound by a TF in existing data are not regulated by that TF and we do not know how to predict which ones are. Our preliminary results show that some, but clearly not all, of the problem can be explained by technical issues inherent to the existing datasets. We there propose to generate new, comprehensive data sets that are ideally suited to studying the relationship between binding and functional regulation (Aim 1). We will use these datasets to quantify the predictive power of the independent action model. In Aim 2, we will collect genome- wide data focused understanding the interactions between TF binding and local chromatin state to see we can use the information to extend the independent action model to increase its predictive power. Finally, we will collect genome-wide data to identify TF-TF interactions that affect the gene expression response to perturbation. We will assess the predictive power of this information using computational models. This project will produce the first consistent data set that is well suited to studying the relationship between TF binding and regulation as well as the first credible overview of regulatory logic for any eukaryote. At the conclusion, we will know why perturbation of a TF apparently activates some of the genes it binds, represses other genes it binds, and does nothing at all to most of the genes it binds. Is it just the limitations of existing high-throughput data sets, or do interactions dominate independent action? What determines which genes are activated by a transcription factor (TF), which are repressed, and which are not regulated? The textbook model is that a TF directly regulates the genes in whose regulatory regions it binds. But the reality is that existing, large genomic data sets do not support this model. The proposed project will generate new genomic data sets to directly address this problem, and will investigate to what extent TF-chromatin and TF-TF interactions affect the relationship between TF binding and gene expression.",UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TF BINDING AND GENE EXPRESSION,9789336,R01GM129126,"['Affect ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Chromatin ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Histones ', ' Logic ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Proteins ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Repression ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' S cerevisiae ', "" Brewer's Yeast "", "" Baker's Yeast "", ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', ' Testing ', ' Textbooks ', ' Thermodynamic ', ' Thermodynamics ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Writing ', ' Yeasts ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Location ', ' human data ', ' success ', ' Eukaryota ', ' Eukaryote ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' ChIP assay ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' prediction of response ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' ']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,314166,0.020505443072372825
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,9926115,R35GM127040,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Goals ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Work ', ' Peptide Domain ', ' Protein Domains ', ' Tertiary Protein Structure ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Biological ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Molecular Dynamics Simulation ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Models ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' drug development ', ' drug discovery ', ' mimetics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' small molecule ', ' Length ', ' Affinity ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' multi-task ', ' multitask ', ' therapeutic target ', ' screening ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' ']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,491993,0.05545355635883443
"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases. When transcription factors function they produce eRNAs.

"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9940707,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' wart virus ', ' Methods ', ' Oropharyngeal Neoplasms ', ' Oropharyngeal Tumor ', ' Oropharynx Neoplasms ', ' Oropharynx Tumor ', ' oral pharyngeal neoplasm ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oropharyngeal Tumor ', ' Oropharnyx Cancers ', ' Oropharyngeal Cancer ', ' Oropharyngeal Carcinoma ', ' Oropharynx Cancer ', ' Oropharynx Carcinoma ', ' malignant oropharynx tumor ', ' malignant oropharynx neoplasm ', ' therapy failure ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' base ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' head/neck cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Oropharynx ', ' Oropharynxs ', ' oral pharyngeal ', ' Oropharyngeal ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Institution ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Prognosis ', ' Validation ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer type ', ' prospective ', ' Oncogenic ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' MicroRNA Expression Profiling ', ' global miRNA profiling ', ' miRNA sequencing ', ' miRNA-seq ', ' micro RNA expression profiling ', ' microRNA sequencing ', ' miRNA expression profiling ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' patient biomarkers ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' miRNA biomarkers ', ' miRNA markers ', ' microRNA markers ', ' microRNA biomarkers ', ' prognostic test ', ' prognostic assays ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' treatment risk ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,450262,0.0411748111565834
"Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries Our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and structure-based design of drugs for treatment, rely on experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins and other macromolecules complexed with small molecule ligands. Many of these structures have direct relevance to public health, especially complexes of drug targets with drugs, inhibitors, substrates, or allosteric effectors. Yet, structure-based drug discovery is severely complicated and hindered by experimental bias and the shortcomings of current methods of experimental ligand identification, which often result in misidentified, missing, or misplaced ligands. The propagation of erroneous structures combined with an increased accessibility to structural data not only thwarts reproducibility in biomedical research and drug discovery, but also diverts valuable resources down doomed research avenues. We will leverage our extensive experience validating and refining ligand binding sites to generate ligand reference libraries that will be made publically available on a new web resource dedicated to the interaction of small molecules and macromolecules. These libraries can be used in many downstream applications, such as drug design, computational chemistry, biology, and bioinformatics. We will utilize recent technological advances in machine learning in conjunction with existing tools to create a standardized protocol for density interpretation and unbiased, reproducible ligand identification. This pipeline will not only be able identify and model ligands in unassigned density fragments, but also be able to detect and correct suboptimally refined ligands in existing structures. As the proposed AI will be free from cognitive bias, it should alleviate the most severe problems in structure-based drug design. Because improperly interpreted structures can have a significant deleterious ripple effect, we will experimentally verify select biomedically important structures with dubious experimental support for critical small molecules using use X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy. This proposal addresses current shortcomings of ligand identification in experimentally determined structures through a combination of novel machine learning algorithms and existing validation mechanisms. The main deliverables are 1) curated libraries of validated ligand binding sites and the tools used to produce the libraries and 2) a machine learning assisted pipeline for the interpretation of density fragments corresponding to small molecules within macromolecular structures. Some biologically important ligand binding sites with ambiguous, incomplete, or no experimental data will be experimentally verified using X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy.","Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries",10019572,R01GM132595,"['Algorithms ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Crystallization ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Design ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Ions ', ' Libraries ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Electron Microscopy ', ' Structural Models ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Peptides ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Standardization ', ' Teaching Materials ', ' teacher materials ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' X-Ray Radiation ', ' X-ray ', ' Xray ', ' Generations ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' density ', ' macromolecule ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Single Crystal Diffraction ', ' X Ray Crystallographies ', ' X-Ray Diffraction Crystallography ', ' X-Ray/Neutron Crystallography ', ' Xray Crystallography ', ' X-Ray Crystallography ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Descriptor ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' electron density ', ' experience ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' computational chemistry ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' drug discovery ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Nucleic Acid Binding ', ' Effectiveness ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Stratification ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Ontology ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Docking ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' stem ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' Structural Protein ', ' internet resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' online compendium ', ' web resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' online resource ', ' FAIR data ', ' Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable ', ' FAIR principles ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' structured data ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2020,561173,0.008309361219819612
"Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins Project Summary Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to the precision treatment of disease. When high resolution structures of a protein are available, and many isoforms of the protein have been connected to dif- fering binding preferences, it is possible in principle to model the structures of all isoforms and discover the mechanisms that cause variations in binding preferences. Unfortunately, this discovery process depends on human expertise for examining molecular structure, and given that hundreds of isoforms may exist, a human would be overwhelmed to objectively examine many similar isoforms. To fill this gap, this project will (A1) de- velop software that identifies structural mechanisms that cause differential binding preferences, categorizes similar structural mechanisms, and explains the mechanisms in English. The second aim of this project (A2) is to validate the software at a large scale on families of proteins that exhibit a variety of well-examined binding preferences, and through blind predictions with experimental collaborators. Our approach involves creating software that mimics the visual reasoning techniques employed by structural biologists when examining molecular structures. Not only are these techniques responsible for most major dis- coveries in structural biology, but they are also straightforward to understand by non-computational research- ers. This property will enable our software to immediately integrate into existing workflows at labs that do not focus on computational methods. This property also contrasts from existing methods, which generally output structural models, potential energies, p-values and structural scores which are difficult for non-experts to un- derstand or incorporate into their research. Often, an expert in biophysics is required to interpret the outputs so that they can be operationalized in laboratory environments. In preliminary results, our methods have already identified molecular mechanisms that govern specificity in several families of proteins. Verification against peer-reviewed experimentation has proven the preliminary results correct in almost all cases. Our methods have also been applied to make a blind prediction of binding mechanisms in the ricin toxin, which binds to and damages the human ribosome. With experimental collabo- rators, we showed that our methods correctly identified and predicted the roles of several amino acids with a hitherto unknown role in recognizing the ribosome. Using our methodological approach and our rigorous valida- tion strategy, this project will produce a highly validated, usable software package that will bridge a critical gap in the development of precision therapies and diagnostics. Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to precision medicine and precise diagnostics. We will develop software that will identify and categorize molecular mechanisms that cause these variations. The resulting insights will enable clinicians to more precisely select therapies to achieve superior outcomes.",Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins,10164894,R01GM123131,"['Algorithms ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Charge ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feedback ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hydrogen Bonding ', ' H-bond ', ' Influentials ', ' Laboratories ', ' Ligands ', ' Literature ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex ', ' Histocompatibility Complex ', ' Histocompatibility Complices ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complices ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Structural Models ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Peptide Hydrolases ', ' Esteroproteases ', ' Peptidases ', ' Protease Gene ', ' Proteases ', ' Proteinases ', ' Proteolytic Enzymes ', ' Proteins ', ' Nicotinic Receptors ', ' Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors ', ' Research ', ' Ribosomes ', ' Ricin ', ' Castor Bean Lectin ', ' RCA 60 ', ' RCA60 ', ' Ricinus Communis Agglutinin II ', ' Ricinus Lectin ', ' Ricinus Toxin ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Serine Protease ', ' Serine Endopeptidases ', ' Serine Protein Hydrolases ', ' Serine Proteinases ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Toxin ', ' Tweens ', ' Universities ', ' HIV Protease ', ' HIV Proteinase ', ' HTLV-III Protease ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' English Language ', ' Electrostatics ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' preference ', ' hydropathy ', ' mutant ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' structural biology ', ' Hydrophobicity ', ' Potential Energy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Property ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Protein Family ', ' Address ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' biophysical mechanism ', ' Biophysical Process ', ' Resolution ', ' Structural Biologist ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Validation ', ' Hot Spot ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Docking ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' Population ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision therapies ', ' precision treatment ', ' Precision therapeutics ', ' personalized diagnosis ', ' precise diagnostics ', ' precision diagnostics ', ' personalized diagnostics ', ' human-in-the-loop ', ' ']",NIGMS,LEHIGH UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,100356,0.07003682636271545
Transfer learning approaches for integration of single cell RNA sequencing data from multiple sources Project Summary Neurobiology and Neurooncology are challenging fields of study due to the complexity of the brain as an organ as well as the difficulty in attaining human samples of brain tissue. These challenges have increasingly been addressed by the use of mouse models and molecular profiling that have uncovered complex sets of cell types. Fundamentally all cell types contain the same DNA but can be stratified by their RNA profile. This approach has taken advantage of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) which allows for single cells to be measured individually and for many cell types to be uncovered. In the past 5 years these experiments have become ever more prolific with large numbers of labeled datasets of single cells. These datasets can be used to explore a variety of questions involving the stratification of cell types to the distribution of these cell types in tissue. One of the most promising areas is the use of these cell types to better understand tumor heterogeneity and response to treatment. A promising avenue to leverage these diverse datasets for the study of heterogeneity is Transfer Learning. Transfer Learning is the subfield of Machine Learning that applies information learned from source data to target data to generate more generalizable or accurate models. We will develop methods to combine datasets into more robust models of tissue heterogeneity using transfer learning in both normal and Glioblastoma brain. These models can be used to predict clinical outcomes and study unique cellular relationships between datasets. Project Narrative The brain is a very complex organ with a wide variety of cell types -- the more granular of which have just recently been uncovered. We develop transfer-learning methods to integrate multiple datasets across species and disease states to glean information that will improve our understanding of the brain at the cellular level. We reframe Glioblastoma's genetic associations to survival as mixtures of quantifiable cell types effectively eliminating the “curse of dimensionality” via semi-supervised transfer-learning.,Transfer learning approaches for integration of single cell RNA sequencing data from multiple sources,9879629,F31LM013056,"['Atlases ', ' Systematic Bias ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Environment ', ' Glioblastoma ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Grade IV Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Astrocytoma ', ' glioblastoma multiforme ', ' spongioblastoma multiforme ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Patients ', ' Reproducibility of Results ', ' Reproducibility of Findings ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Standardization ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Measures ', ' Glean ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Brain Glioblastoma Multiforme ', ' Grade IV Brain Astrocytic Neoplasm ', ' Grade IV Brain Astrocytic Tumor ', ' Grade IV Brain Astrocytoma ', ' Brain Glioblastoma ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' brain tissue ', ' Outcome Study ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Stratification ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Outcome ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' tumor ', ' neurooncology ', ' neuro-oncology ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' clinically actionable ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' Intratumoral heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneity in tumors ', ' intra-tumoral heterogeneity ', ' intratumor heterogeneity ', ' tumor heterogeneity ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' neural network ', ' multiple data sets ', ' multiple datasets ', ' multiple data sources ', ' multiple data types ', ' ']",NLM,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,12953,0.02841333448586533
"Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo. ABSTRACT: “Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo”  microRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small regulatory RNAs involved in repression of gene expression. They recognize their target mRNAs though base pairing and upon binding, trigger translational repression, deadenylation and decay of the target mRNAs. Given that each miRNA has the potential to regulate hundreds of genes, and several dozens of miRNAs are expressed in each cell type, miRNAs are one of the master regulators of gene expression at post-transcriptional level in animals, plants and virus. Thus, the elucidation of the miRNA complement is essential to understand gene regulation and mRNA turnover. The goal of this project is to develop a high-throughput method for miRNA discovery and experimental validation in vivo.  Current miRNA discovery methods heavily rely on providing sequencing evidence of a small RNA that fits into a hairpin-like structure predicted bioinformatically. The problem is that sample availability or the abundance of a specific cell type in a tissue may be limited and hamper the number of miRNAs that can be backed-up with sequencing support. In these situations, the current solution is to sequence deeper, increasing overall costs. On the other hand, the presence of a small RNA of ~22-nt does not guarantee the belonging to the miRNA family, as random degradation of cellular RNAs also will produce small RNAs of this size and only tedious experimental validation of their processing into intermediate species and mature miRNA can confirm their identity.  A recent curation work found that of the over ~7,000 metazoan miRNAs in miRBase, the reference miRNA database, only 1,175 fulfilled the features necessary to pass as miRNAs, directly rejected 3,470 as false positives and lacked enough sequencing evidence to call another 2,105 miRNAs. Therefore, there is an unmet technological need to develop a miRNA validation method that boosts the access to the miRNA candidates even from limited samples and that allows rigorous multiplexed experimental validation of their processing.  With the synergy of an interdisciplinary team that combines expertise in microRNAs and zebrafish manipulation (Dr. Cifuentes, PI) and bioinformatics (Dr. Moxon, co-I), we will develop miRAGe (miRNA Analysis Genome wide), a high-throughput method to integrate miRNA prediction and their experimental validation in vivo. The fundamental concept behind miRAGe is the use of living cells as “organic computers” to analyze miRNA processing. We will use massively parallel oligo pool synthesis to prepare the miRNA candidate precursors and test their processing in injected zebrafish embryos. Small RNA sequencing will determine which candidates are true microRNA by detecting their ~22-nucleotide mature product and their stereotypic intermediates.  Overall, the results from this project will transform the access of the scientific community to high quality, experimentally validated miRNA data from any organism with genomic data available, thus enhancing future transversal studies on post-transcriptional regulation. NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a high-throughput method to integrate microRNA prediction and their experimental validation in vivo. We will take advantage of oligo pool synthesis to prepare the microRNA candidate precursors and test their processing after injection in zebrafish embryos.

"Characterization and modeling of m6A RNA methylation in cancer ABSTRACT The most abundant internal mRNA modification is N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and growing evidence has suggested its critical roles in cancer. However, the global patterns of m6A RNA modification and its regulators over large patient cohorts are not available. It remains unclear how m6A RNA modification contributes to cancer initiation/progression and how it may be used in cancer therapy. The objective is to systematically characterize the genome-wide patterns of m6A RNA modification and its regulators using well-characterized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patient cohorts, elucidate their interactions with other molecular aberrations, and assess their potential clinical utility. The working hypothesis is that the dysregulation of m6A RNA methylation plays critical roles in cancer development and may represent potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We will pursue three specific aims: Aim #1. Generate the genome-wide profiles of m6A RNA methylation using TCGA sample cohorts. As part of an NCI Functional Proteomic Center, our team has unique access to these samples. We have developed a sensitive, robust m6A-seq protocol, and will apply it to ~1,000 patient samples from diverse cancer types, and generate high-quality, standardized m6A genome-wide profile data. Aim #2. Generate the protein expression profiles of m6A regulators using TCGA sample cohorts. Using the MD Anderson reverse-phase protein array platform, we will characterize the expression levels of ~30 protein markers (including both total and phosphorylated proteins) of 15 m6A regulators (five writers, two readers, and eight erasers) over ~8,000 samples of 31 cancer types as well as ~400 common cancer cell lines. Aim #3. Perform the integrative analysis and modeling of m6A RNA methylation data in a rich TCGA context. Using TCGA multi-dimensional molecular data, we will develop predictive models that quantify the effects of various factors involved in m6A RNA modification by deep learning. We will perform analyses to define m6A-based tumor subtypes, assess the clinical utility of m6A-related markers, and study the interactions of m6A with other molecular aberrations in diverse tumor contexts. Finally, we will build a publicly available, user-friendly database that will contain comprehensive information of the m6A data generated through Aim #1 and Aim #2. The expected outcome of this project is (i) the establishment of an integrated resource of m6A-related genomic and proteomic data based on the most widely used cancer patient cohorts, so that further investigation of such data can be conducted by the cancer research community fluently; and (ii) assessment of the biological and clinical utility of m6A RNA methylation for cancer therapy in a comprehensive way. This project is innovative because it will systematically assess the clinical relevance and functions of a key class of RNA modifications that are currently understudied in cancer research. These results will have an important positive impact because the knowledge gained will not only greatly advance our understanding of the role of m6A RNA methylation in cancer development, but also directly facilitate the development of a novel class of cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because systematic characterization of RNA modifications in large, well-characterized clinical patient cohorts is expected to advance our understanding of the molecular basis of human cancers, thereby helping the development of more effective treatment approaches.

"Integrative cellular deconvolution of human brain RNA sequencing data Many projects have characterized the human brain transcriptome within and across cell types to better understand changes in RNA expression associated with brain development and aging, developmental or psychiatric brain disorders, and genetic variation. Large consortia, including psychENCODE, CommonMind and BrainSeq Consortiums, have primarily focused on the molecular profiling of RNA extracted from homogenate/bulk tissue from different brain regions across thousands of individuals. However, bulk tissue like the frontal cortex contains a mixture of different important cell populations, and failing to account for the underlying composition of tissue samples can cause both false positives and missed signal in differential expression analysis. Therefore, statistical methods referred to as ""cellular deconvolution"" have been developed that estimate the relative fractions of different cell types in bulk RNA-seq datasets. These cell fractions can then be used to control for differences in cell composition across bulk tissue samples and can better determine the cell type(s) that drive differential expression signal in bulk tissue data. However, these approaches require reference expression profiles from the underlying cell types that will be estimated, which can be difficult to generate from human postmortem brain tissue. Recent approaches have leveraged single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) or single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets to construct these reference profiles and perform cellular deconvolution, particularly in peripheral tissues. While many statistical or machine learning approaches have been proposed, the majority produce similar composition estimates for a given reference dataset. However, as we describe in this application, many of these existing reference datasets -regardless of the algorithm employed - are largely non- comparable to the vast majority of bulk RNA sequencing data generated from postmortem human brain tissue, and have produced incorrect estimates of cellular composition. Current algorithms estimate the relative fraction of RNA attributable to each cell type, and not the relative fraction of cell types. We therefore propose to generate a more comprehensive framework for performing cellular deconvolution in human postmortem RNA- seq data.This proposal will leverage the extensive bulk RNA sequencing performed over the past decade to better determine the relative role of cell type-specific expression in the human brain and their subsequent dysregulation in debilitating brain disorders. Recent approaches have leveraged single cell or nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to perform cellular deconvolution on homogenate datasets, but many current algorithms estimate the relative fraction of RNA attributable to each cell type, and not the relative fraction of cell types. This proposal therefore aims to develop novel reference and validation datasets necessary to implement cellular, and not RNA, deconvolution from RNA-seq datasets, which will become publicly available software. We will lastly apply this novel deconvolution approach to thousands of homogenate RNA-seq samples to identify cell type-specific insights into debilitating brain disorders.",Integrative cellular deconvolution of human brain RNA sequencing data,10007230,R01MH123183,"['Accounting ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Astrocytes ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Astroglia ', ' astrocytic glia ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Calibration ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Genes ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Oligodendroglia ', ' Oligodendrocytes ', ' Oligodendrocytus ', ' Oligodendroglia Cell ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Small Nuclear RNA ', ' Low Molecular Weight Nuclear RNA ', ' Small Molecular Weight RNA ', ' snRNA ', ' uRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Peripheral ', ' Hortega cell ', ' gitter cell ', ' mesoglia ', ' microglial cell ', ' microgliocyte ', ' perivascular glial cell ', ' Microglia ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' cell type ', ' brain tissue ', ' Nuclear ', ' novel ', ' Cell Fraction ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' Population ', ' Bioconductor ', ' oligodendrocyte precursor ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differential expression ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' web application ', ' web app ', ' secondary analysis ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' statistical learning ', ' ']",NIMH,"LIEBER INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2020,620747,0.0943436033861058
"Integrative miRNA data analysis for clinical cancer genomics PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed research has two broad, long-term objectives. First, it seeks to shift medical practice toward more personalized treatments, by applying innovative methods to analyze and integrate DNA, RNA and protein data generated by a large network of GDAN researchers in a miRNA-centric framework. Analyses will identify cancer subtypes, and individual patients within a subtype, in which alterations in the expression of certain miRNAs influence cancer pathogenesis and drug response. Second, the proposed research seeks to shift cancer genomics research by allowing a diverse group of cancer researchers to flexibly access and use the project’s cancer genomics data, and microRNA-centric results and methods, through a cloud computing framework. The proposed research has three specific aims: 1) Build a computational pipeline for processing and analysis of miRNA data, 2) Elucidate the regulation of and by miRNAs through integrative analysis, and 3) Delineate the role of miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment using predictive modeling. Research design and methods: 1) Processing and analysis of miRNA data. We will process total RNA sequence data to identify expressed miRNAs, and extend the current processing pipeline to identify potentially functional miRNA sequence variants. We will apply our miRNA-centric analyses developed for The Cancer Genome Atlas project to identify: subtypes within a cancer, miRNAs that are associated with survival, miRNA targeting effects on gene and protein expression, and cis-effects of copy number and DNA methylation on miRNA abundances. 2) Regulation of and by miRNAs. Collaborating within the research network, we will extend our analysis methods to take into account additional datatypes and functional contexts that influence how miRNAs are regulated, and how they regulate genes and their products. 3) Predictive modeling. As the research network will have detailed clinical data and multiplatform genomic data, we will apply machine learning algorithms in a novel context to key sets of genes, proteins and miRNAs that predict clinical outcomes like survival and drug response. 4) Cloud computing. We will make our data, analysis methods and results readily available to a broad group of researchers within a cloud computing framework. NARRATIVE MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~22 nt) RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate levels of gene products, including proteins that are drug targets in cancer. In order to shift medical practice towards personalized treatments, the proposed research will apply innovative analysis methods to understand the role of miRNA expression on survival and drug response, within the context of DNA, RNA and protein data generated in a large research network.

"Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins Project Summary Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to the precision treatment of disease. When high resolution structures of a protein are available, and many isoforms of the protein have been connected to dif- fering binding preferences, it is possible in principle to model the structures of all isoforms and discover the mechanisms that cause variations in binding preferences. Unfortunately, this discovery process depends on human expertise for examining molecular structure, and given that hundreds of isoforms may exist, a human would be overwhelmed to objectively examine many similar isoforms. To fill this gap, this project will (A1) de- velop software that identifies structural mechanisms that cause differential binding preferences, categorizes similar structural mechanisms, and explains the mechanisms in English. The second aim of this project (A2) is to validate the software at a large scale on families of proteins that exhibit a variety of well-examined binding preferences, and through blind predictions with experimental collaborators. Our approach involves creating software that mimics the visual reasoning techniques employed by structural biologists when examining molecular structures. Not only are these techniques responsible for most major dis- coveries in structural biology, but they are also straightforward to understand by non-computational research- ers. This property will enable our software to immediately integrate into existing workflows at labs that do not focus on computational methods. This property also contrasts from existing methods, which generally output structural models, potential energies, p-values and structural scores which are difficult for non-experts to un- derstand or incorporate into their research. Often, an expert in biophysics is required to interpret the outputs so that they can be operationalized in laboratory environments. In preliminary results, our methods have already identified molecular mechanisms that govern specificity in several families of proteins. Verification against peer-reviewed experimentation has proven the preliminary results correct in almost all cases. Our methods have also been applied to make a blind prediction of binding mechanisms in the ricin toxin, which binds to and damages the human ribosome. With experimental collabo- rators, we showed that our methods correctly identified and predicted the roles of several amino acids with a hitherto unknown role in recognizing the ribosome. Using our methodological approach and our rigorous valida- tion strategy, this project will produce a highly validated, usable software package that will bridge a critical gap in the development of precision therapies and diagnostics. Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to precision medicine and precise diagnostics. We will develop software that will identify and categorize molecular mechanisms that cause these variations.

"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites.

"Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads Project Summary RNA modifications are pervasive throughout the human transcriptome and affect transcript stability, localization, and function. In particular, ADAR-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) edits in RNA have been shown to affect pre-mRNA splicing and alter codon sequence. Amino acid changes caused by inosines have been implicated in various deleterious conditions, which include cancer and diseases of the brain. However, previous literature mapping inosine positions in high-throughput were only able to do so inside the limited context provided by short RNA-Seq reads. As modifications can be transcript-specific, elucidating the association of inosines with full mRNA isoforms is crucial for a more rigorous understanding of the role of inosine modifications in the tissues of our body and, more broadly, disease. Therefore, I propose to investiate A-to-I editing in the context of diseased and non-diseased systems using full-length mRNA nanopore sequencing. The nanopore is able to sequence whole RNA strands by converting changes in electrical current caused by RNA translocating through the pore into nucleotide sequence. ​Aim 1 leverages high-accuracy nanopore cDNA sequencing of cellular systems with and without ADAR knockdown to interrogate ADAR function and A-to-I-induced changes to transcript expression changes. To accomplish the latter, I will develop workflows to determine isoform structure from noisy, long reads. In addition to sequencing full-length transcripts, nanopore native RNA (nvRNA) sequencing informs on RNA modifications, as modified nucleotides appear as subtle alteration in current signal with respect to canonical nucleotides. As such, ​Aim 2 ​employs a generalizable approach to producing cost-effective training data for systematically understanding how inosines alter current signals in nanopores. I will use a Cas13b-ADAR fusion protein (REPAIRv2) to create site-specific edits and then perform nvRNA sequencing on the edited transcriptome. Site-specific A-to-I editing allows this approach to create a labelled inosine dataset in nvRNA signal from which I can develop computational algorithms to reliably identify inosines in nvRNA data. The REPAIRv2 approach to can be generalized to eventually identify any RNA modification with nanopores. ​Aim 3 will elucidate how A-to-I editing differs between tissues. I will sequence 4 normal tissue types with nvRNA sequencing, generating a map of A-to-I edits in conjunction with isoform usage using the software I am developing. Taken together, the fulfillment of these aims will not only provide further insights on elusive ADAR mechanism, but also create workflows for nanopore data analysis and a platform for the study of any modification. As I work toward my Ph.D. with this interdisciplinary project, I will gain invaluable skills in experimental and computational biology that will prepare me for a career in science. Project Narrative Understanding the functional outcomes of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing in greater depth is crucial to understanding cancer, diseases of the brain, and other deleterious effects that arise from modification misregulation. To study inosines in full-length mRNA contexts, we will use nanopore sequencing to generate a map of A-to-I editing in diseased and non-diseased transcriptomes.

"Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology Summary Technological advances such as next-generation sequencing and single-cell analysis have opened the flood gates for RNA analysis, revealing that the transcriptome is significantly more complex than previously thought, both with respect to the diversity of RNA transcripts, their temporal expression dynamics, and their cellular location. Moreover, thousands of dysregulated RNAs have been observed in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These observations underscore the dire need for new molecular tools to precisely dissect RNA function in health and disease. The goal of my research program is to harness the unprecedented power of CRISPR-Cas systems to create a versatile range of methods to precisely manipulate virtually any RNA, and to use these tools to explore fundamental knowledge gaps in RNA biology. This proposal specifically focuses on addressing the following knowledge gaps: 1) Despite the technological advances in harnessing RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzymes Cas9 and Cas13 for research and clinical applications, we still do not understand the principles of gRNA selection for efficient and tunable RNA-targeting. This problem precludes the facile development of a number of RNA-targeting applications and underscores the need for a thorough interrogation of gRNA selection. Our goal here is to develop a model to predict highly-active gRNAs for Cas9/Cas13 RNA- targeting in human cells. We will use a combination of high-throughput RNA:protein interactome methods, flow- cytometry based gRNA screens and machine learning to precisely define features of highly active RNA-targeting gRNAs for RNA-binding and knockdown for Cas9 and Cas13. 2) The vast majority of human RNAs are alternatively spliced, and RNA splicing defects are common in cancers and neurological diseases. However, our understanding of the downstream functional effects of splicing in a majority of cases is rudimentary. To address this issue, we will develop a toolbox of robust, multiplexable Cas-based splicing factors to offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the functional consequences of alternative splicing. that can determine in a single step both the identity of proteins bound to a And 3) There is a paucity of methods specific RNA and their location on that RNA. The development of such an approach will enable us to determine the spatial arrangement of proteins on specific RNAs to dissect their dynamic deposition in range of RNA processes such as transcription, 3ʹ-end and micro-RNA processing, and lncRNA function. To address this issue, we propose to develop a genetically encodable Cas-based RNA proximity-labeling strategy to precisely identify proteins that bind in close proximity to a specific RNA sequence. We will then use this approach to identify protein factors involved in regulating microprocessor (Drosha/DGCR8) activity at specific primary micro-RNA loci. These research goals fully align with the NIGMS 5 Year Strategic Plan, through the development of essential research tools to study and RNA function for biomedical research. Project Narrative RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas proteins offer an unprecedented opportunity to precisely manipulate RNA biology in ways not currently possible. We propose several innovative approaches to address critical knowledge gaps in CRISPR-Cas tool development and chart a path to use these tools to interrogate several fundamental questions in RNA biology. Our approaches will help us define the gRNA design rules for RNA-targeting Cas proteins, and develop robust new RNA-targeting Cas tools to manipulate RNA splicing and dissect protein- RNA interaction networks, and ultimately, the tools developed here will transform the way we study RNA and will broadly impact the fields of molecular and cell biology.",Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology,10133962,R35GM133462,"['Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Floods ', ' Flooding ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Microprocessor ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Guide RNA ', ' gRNA ', ' RNA Sequences ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' single cell analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' RNA analysis ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' RNA bound ', ' RNA Binding ', ' RNA Processing ', ' BCAR1 ', ' BCAR1 Protein ', ' Breast Cancer Anti-Estrogen Resistance 1 Protein ', ' CKRAS protein ', ' CRK-Associated Substrate ', ' CRKAS ', ' Cas protein ', ' p130 cas protein ', ' p130CAS ', ' BCAR1 gene ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' NIGMS ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' RNA-Protein Interaction ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Transcript ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' tool development ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R35,2020,46902,0.19092726241230593
"Establishing the Role of Genetic Variation in Vitamin D Regulated Gene Expression in MS Pathogenesis and Severity Project Summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease that destroys the protective myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells, and its cause is unknown. MS prevalence is higher in regions farther from the equator, leading to the hypothesis that sun exposure, and consequently vitamin D exposure, has a protective effect on MS risk. Recent studies utilizing Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis have demonstrated strong evidence for a causal role of low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in MS pathogenesis; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the association are unknown. It is well established that 25(OH)D signaling operates through the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), a ligand-regulated transcription factor. VDRs recognize specific binding sites in DNA, leading to activation or suppression of a target gene. Previous research has found that genetic variation of tagging SNPs (VDR-BVs) within these VDR binding sites, can alter binding affinity. These VDR-BVs are enriched in genomic regions associated with MS, as well as with several other autoimmune diseases, which suggests regulation of specific genes mediated by vitamin D could affect MS risk and severity. No formal investigation of genetic variation of individual VDR-BVs in MS cases and controls has been reported and VDR-BVs are strong candidates to investigate for genetic variation relevant to MS. The overall objective of this F31 application is to estimate the effect of VDR-BVs on MS risk and severity. We hypothesize that genetic variation in VDR-BVs is associated with MS susceptibility and severity, and further, that the effect of this genetic variation on MS is modulated by bioavailability of vitamin D. Our approach will use a dataset of approximately 10,000 clinically definite MS cases and 35,000 controls frequency matched on age and race/ethnicity with whole genome genotypes, demographic, clinical, and environmental exposure data and will: 1) Estimate the association between VDR-BVs near established MS risk loci and MS risk and severity; 2) Estimate the association between VDR-BVs across the human genome and MS risk and severity; and 3) Replicate findings in independent datasets of MS cases and controls and combine replicated associations across all datasets via meta-analysis. VDR-BVs were previously identified through ChIP-seq analysis in Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines and we will use machine learning to prioritize candidate VDR-BVs for Aim 2. Analyses will incorporate a genetic instrumental variable as measure of 25(OH)D bioavailability to test for interaction between VDR-BVs and 25(OH)D bioavailability. Results from the proposed aims will determine whether MS GWAS findings are partially explained by genetic variation in VDR binding affinity, identify genetic risk factors for MS related to vitamin D, and identify new genes and regulatory pathways involved in the development of MS. Ultimately, the goal of this work understand the mechanisms by which vitamin D affects this immune- mediated neurological disorder. Project Narrative Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease that results in significant disability and decreased quality of life with both genetic and environmental risk factors. MS prevalence is higher in regions farther from the equator, and recent research has demonstrated evidence supporting a causal role for low vitamin D in MS risk and disease severity.

"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,9995511,R01GM123314,"['Algorithms ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Exons ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Ribonucleoproteins ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' insight ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' protein profiling ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' K562 Cells ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' RNA bound ', ' RNA Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' protein expression ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Protein Binding Motif ', ' Protein-Protein Interaction Domain ', ' Protein Binding Domain ', ' RNA-Protein Interaction ', ' Computational Technique ', ' K562 ', ' K562 blasts ', ' K-562 ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Putative RNA-Binding Region ', ' RNA Binding Domain ', ' RNP Domain ', ' RNP Motif ', ' RNP-1 Signature ', ' RNA Recognition Motif ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' deep sequencing ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' computational studies ', ' computer studies ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' user-friendly ', ' human disease ', ' comparative ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' MALAT1 ', ' metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 ', ' MALAT1 gene ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differential expression ', ' Hep G2 ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' HepG2 ', ' CLIP-Seq ', ' HITS-CLIP ', ' High-throughput sequencing of CLIP cDNA library ', ' crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing ', ' predictive tools ', ' internet resource ', ' on-line compendium ', ' on-line resource ', ' online compendium ', ' web resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' online resource ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' RNA metabolism ', ' ']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2020,302789,0.13268414676822698
"Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation PROJECT SUMMARY  Studies are proposed to dissect one of the fundamental, binary development decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. The nematode C. elegans determines sex with remarkable precision by tallying X- chromosome number relative to the sets of autosomes (X:A signal): ratios of 1X:2A (0.5) and 2X:3A (0.67) signal male fate, while ratios of 3X:4A (0.75) and 2X:2A (1.0) signal hermaphrodite fate. We have discovered much about the nature and action of the X:A signal and its direct target, a master sex-determination-switch gene that also controls X-chromosome dosage compensation. However, a fundamental question remains: how is the signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? We pioneer new methods using machine learning neural networks to address this question with single-molecule and single-cell resolution. We also propose to dissect the functional interplay between chromatin modification and chromosome structure in regulating gene expression over vast chromosomal territories. X-chromosome dosage compensation in C. elegans is exemplary for this analysis: we found recently that dosage-compensated X chromosomes have (i) elevated levels of modified histone H4K20me1 compared to autosomes and (ii) a unique three-dimensional architecture. Both are imposed by the dosage compensation complex (DCC). Loss of H4K20me1 disrupts 3D architecture and elevates X gene expression. In the nematode DCC, one subunit is an H4K20me2 demethylase and five subunits are homologs of condensin subunits, which compact and resolve mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. All DCC subunits are recruited specifically to hermaphrodite X chromosomes by an XX-specific subunit that triggers binding to cis- acting regulatory elements on X (rex) to reduce gene expression by half. The DCC remodels the structure of X into topologically associating domains (TADs) using its highest affinity rex sites to establish domain boundaries. Despite this knowledge, important questions underlying the mechanisms of dosage compensation remain. What DCC subunits recognize the X-enriched motifs in rex sites to bind X directly? How does the DCC regulate RNA polymerase II to repress gene expression? What mechanisms underlie H4K20me1's control of chromosome structure, and how does DCC-mediated higher-order structure affect gene expression? Our findings should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state. Lastly, we will exploit our unexpected finding that rex sites have diverged across Caenorhabditis species separated by 30 MYR, retaining no functional overlap despite strong conservation of the core DCC machinery. This divergence provides an unusual opportunity to study the path for a concerted co- evolutionary change in hundreds of target sites across X chromosomes and the protein complexes that bind them. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our work dissects one of the fundamental, binary developmental decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. While we have discovered detailed molecular mechanisms about the nature and action of the signal that determines sex in the nematode C. elegans and its direct target, a critical question remains that we address: how is the sex signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? Our work also explores the functional interplay between chromosome structure, chromatin modification, and long-distance regulation of gene expression by studying X- chromosome dosage compensation. The nematode dosage compensation complex, a condensin complex, equalizes X-chromosome gene expression between the sexes by imposing a unique three-dimensional architecture onto hermaphrodite X chromosomes and by catalyzing enrichment of the modified histone H4K20me1 through a subunit that is a H4K20me2 histone demethylase. Results from exploring the connection between higher-order chromosome structure and chromatin modification should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state.",Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation,9898392,R35GM131845,"['Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Bacteria ', ' Caenorhabditis ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Dosage Compensation (Genetics) ', ' Dosage Compensation ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Switch Genes ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hermaphroditism ', ' Intersexuality ', ' Histones ', ' male ', ' Mammals ', ' Mammalia ', ' Meiosis ', ' meiotic ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' Nematoda ', ' Nematodes ', ' roundworm ', ' RNA Polymerase II ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase II ', ' RNA Polymerase B ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Work ', ' X Chromosome ', ' X Inactivation ', ' Lyonization ', ' X-Chromosome Inactivation ', ' Mediating ', ' C elegans ', ' C. elegans ', ' C.elegans ', ' Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' dosage ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' autosome ', ' Structure ', ' Chromosomal Organization ', ' Chromosomal Structure ', ' Chromosome Organization ', ' Chromosome Structures ', ' single molecule ', ' condensin ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' protein complex ', ' sex determination ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Folding ', ' Higher Order Structure ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Structure ', ' Mitotic ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Chromosomal Territory ', ' Chromosome Territory ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' histone demethylase ', ' recruit ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R35,2020,466290,0.014761783909813201
"Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control Revealed by Nascent Transcript Sequencing Large consortium efforts have collected hundreds of genome-wide datasets that have delineated myriad regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and large numbers of coding and non-coding transcripts. Even with this massive amount of data, it remains a significant challenge to determine how the mapped elements function together in regulatory networks. This is due in large part to our inability to accurately and quantitatively detect all forms of nascent transcription, the instantaneous output of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, our understanding of global gene regulation is restricted by a lack of computational tools that seamlessly integrate genome-wide datasets. The overall goal of this proposal is to maximize the impact of nascent transcriptome studies and enable facile integration with other functional genomic data. My group developed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), that enables the strand-specific nucleotide-resolution mapping of RNA polymerase density, highlighting all transcriptional activity regardless of transcript half-lives and revealing precise positions of Pol II pausing where regulatory control is applied. Here, we will develop a new version of NET-seq – NET-seq 2.0 – that enables the routine, scalable and flexible application to diverse human cell types (or any eukaryotic system). Moreover, we will increase the potential of NET-seq analysis by developing two innovative bioinformatics strategies to seamlessly integrate NET-seq data with other genome-wide datasets that will have applications beyond NET-seq studies. To demonstrate the broad utility of our integrated approach, we will study regulatory networks and cell differentiation for which instantaneous nascent transcriptional analysis will be highly impactful. In Aim 1, our goal is to make NET-seq easier, cheaper, and more flexible. Our improvements will reduce background and increase usable reads, dramatically reduce cell input requirements (100-1000-fold), enable dense, region-specific RNA transcription analyses, and enable quantitative comparisons between samples and conditions. In Aim 2, we will determine transcription kinetics through integrating NET-seq with metabolic RNA labeling (TT-seq) data which report local synthesis rates. This integrative approach yields a rich transcriptional phenotype that we will use to develop gene regulatory network models. In Aim 3, we will create new computational algorithms that circumvent the need to determine each molecular event separately, and instead infer the status of unmapped events using information-rich datasets, such as NET-seq. We will use integrative deep neural networks (`deep-learning') that use available genome-wide datasets to predict unavailable datasets from data already on hand. We will apply this approach to study erythropoiesis using a well- defined primary human hematopoietic differentiation system by a time series NET-seq and DNase-seq analysis. These data will inform deep neural network models to predict ChIP-seq data for myriad transcription factors and chromatin marks to investigate key regulatory events without additional expense. The proposed research is relevant to public health, because discovery of regulatory mechanisms in transcription at high resolution is ultimately expected to significantly impact our understanding of most human disease.

"Mapping RNA polymerase in tissue samples with ChRO-seq. PROJECT ABSTRACT Deciphering how complex programs of gene expression and regulation contribute to human disease is one of the major challenges facing the field of genomics. Over the past decade, a wealth of new high-throughput genomics tools have revolutionized how we identify active genomic regions and appear poised to make great strides in understanding the mechanisms of disease. Yet the application of most of these technologies has been limited to established cell lines. Currently, approaches being developed to comprehensively map functional elements across the genome involve combining data from several different genome-wide experimental assays, making them expensive and impractical to use in clinical isolates of limited quantity or even to analyze new cell lines. Compounding these technical difficulties, gene expression is a complex and highly tissue dependent biological process, and many important applications will require the direct interrogation of clinical isolates or other similarly limited sources of sample. Thus, efficient new tools that map the repertoire of functional elements across the genome are likely to transform the biomedical and clinical sciences.  We propose to develop Chromatin Run-On and Sequencing (ChRO-seq) and a suite of computational tools for mapping transcription directly in limited tissue samples. Our approach uses a single genome-wide molecular assay to efficiently identify the location of promoters and enhancers, transcription factor binding sites, gene and lincRNA boundaries, transcription levels, and impute certain histone modifications. Preliminary ChRO-seq data reveals patterns of transcription that are virtually identical to those using Precision Run on and Sequencing in cultured cells, but can easily be applied in solid tissue samples. We applied our preliminary ChRO-seq technology to several primary tumors, revealing new insights into how transcriptional regulation underlies cancer development and progression, and providing a key proof-of-concept motivating further technology development. We anticipate that ChRO-seq and the computational methods proposed will enable the efficient discovery of functional elements in virtually any cell sample. In addition, ChRO-seq has the unique advantage that it can be applied in limited tissue samples and clinical isolates even after the degradation of mRNA. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a suite of molecular and computational technologies that allow researchers to directly measure transcriptional regulation of genes, enhancers, and lincRNAs in limited clinical isolates.

"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs. RNA structure is detrimental to RNA function and regulatory element activity. Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops. This will allow him to learn innovative and effective ways to teach biology and progress to become a well- rounded scientist and mentor. Dr. Beaudoin existing expertise and the scientific and training plans of this proposal will allow him to reaching his long-term career goal: to establish a research program to understand the role of RNA structures and RNA helicases in vertebrate development. Defective RNA helicases have been associated to dozens of human diseases (e.g. infertility, neurological disorders, cancers and aging). Therefore, their molecular characterization in a relevant vertebrate model will provide invaluable insights to develop new human therapeutic approaches. Dr. Beaudoin is fully committed to obtain an appointment as a tenure track junior faculty in academia. It is fully expected that Dr. Beaudoin will be competitive for such group leader appointments at the completion of his K99/R00 Award tailored to enhance his scientific and mentoring skills.

"Methods for improving clinical diagnostic by detection, prediction, interpretation and prioritization of aberrant transcriptome variations The goal of this research program project is to develop methods to improve clinical diagnosis of children with rare Mendelian disorders. Even with the most advanced standard-of-care genetic test of exome sequencing (ES) diagnostic rate is still below 50%. One reason for this rate is that mutations in non-protein coding regions or those that are synonymous (code for the same protein) are generally discarded even though these could be deleterious due to their effect on the processing of RNA transcribed from the underlying gene. We propose 2 complementary methods to help improve clinical diagnosis: The first is “RNA-first”, where our algorithms suggest which clinically accessible tissue (CAT) to use for RNA sequencing, then compare the results to a larger pool of donors to detect which RNA processing variations may be deleterious. The second is a “DNA-first” approach where we develop “RNA splicing code” models that predict the effect of genetic variations on RNA processing in a given tissue of interest. The two approaches, “RNA-first” and “DNA-first”, will be combined into a clinical diagnostic pipeline at the Children Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and applied to solve undiagnosed cases at CHOP and other centers, including the NIH’s Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN). Many children who are born with multiple medical issues have a genetic cause for their differences, but even the best tests cannot identify the genetic cause. This project will develop new computer technology to do a more complete analysis of their genetic testing information to help diagnose more of these children.","Methods for improving clinical diagnostic by detection, prediction, interpretation and prioritization of aberrant transcriptome variations",10033447,R01LM013437,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Exhibits ', ' Exons ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Libraries ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Proteins ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Letters ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' RT-PCR ', ' RTPCR ', ' reverse transcriptase PCR ', ' Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' RNA Processing ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Molecular Diagnosis ', ' P01 Mechanism ', ' P01 Program ', ' Program Project Grant ', ' Research Program Projects ', ' Program Research Project Grants ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' standard of care ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' exome sequencing ', ' congenital anomaly ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' GTEx ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' deep learning ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' causal variant ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' heterogenous data ', ' computational pipelines ', ' gene testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' genetic testing ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,347736,0.08742774850428446
"Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling PROJECT SUMMARY The human body comprises of trillion of cells, which are the building blocks of life. Each cell is highly organized, with various constituents within localizing to specific regions. Location within a cell is a cardinal organizing principle of gene control and function, especially for RNAs that code for proteins or serve regulatory roles as non-coding RNAs. Each cell type has its distinct RNA-species profile, and where these RNAs are located within the cell can dictate their folding, editing, splicing, translation, degradation, binding partners, catalytic activity, and even the fate of the proteins that they encode. Unsurprisingly, perturbations in RNA localization result in disease conditions including cancers and neuropathologies. In spite of the vital importance of subcellular RNA localization in gene expression, investigating such phenomena simultaneously for many RNA species has been challenging. To address these long-standing issues, Dr. Furqan Fazal and others have recently developed a technique called APEX-seq that can track the location of thousands of RNAs in living human cells with high-temporal and nanometer-spatial resolution. APEX-seq has the transformative potential to provide high-resolution snapshots of tens of thousands of endogenous cellular RNA species, free from artifacts of overexpression, cell fixation or recombinant tagging. This proposal outlines a five-year career program for Dr. Fazal as he investigates principles of RNA subcellular localization, and reaches milestone goals that will transition him into an independent investigator. By improving the APEX-seq technique and amalgamating it with a number of cutting-edge tools including massively-parallel reporter assays and deep-learning-based approaches, Dr. Fazal will dissect how sequences within RNAs direct them to different locations, and how cells actively control RNA subcellular localization to regulate gene function. This work will be carried out at Stanford University, where Dr. Fazal will be mentored by Dr. Howard Chang, a pioneer in developing new genomics tools, and Dr. Joanna Wysocka, a leading authority in vertebrate development and non-coding genomic regulatory elements. Both mentors have highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions around the nation and world. Additional support will be available through collaboration with Drs. Shen, Boettiger and Kundaje who will provide training and expertise in genetics, imaging, statistics and computation. An advisory committee comprising of world-leading investigators Drs. Ting, Kool, Li, Bryant and Bassik will also monitor progress and provide expertise. Further acquisition of scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the educational resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. Stanford provides an outstanding intellectually-stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success, and all proposed training will complement Dr. Fazal’s previous knowledge in genomics and biophysics and facilitate his transition into a multidisciplinary RNA biologist in the field of spatial transcriptomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many RNA species within a cell are spatially localized and locally translated into proteins, and previous studies in embryos, neurons and highly-dynamic tissues have demonstrated the vital importance of RNA subcellular location in development and cellular function. However, it has been challenging to study localization transcriptome-wide, which has hampered understanding of the extent and role of such processes in normal and diseased tissues. The proposed work will improve a newly-developed tool for the RNA community to investigate spatial transcriptomics, and use it to provide new insights into RNA biology by determining the regulatory sequences (i.e. the grammar) controlling localization, as well as identifying the associated cellular mechanisms.",Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity

"Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology Summary Technological advances such as next-generation sequencing and single-cell analysis have opened the flood gates for RNA analysis, revealing that the transcriptome is significantly more complex than previously thought, both with respect to the diversity of RNA transcripts, their temporal expression dynamics, and their cellular location. Moreover, thousands of dysregulated RNAs have been observed in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These observations underscore the dire need for new molecular tools to precisely dissect RNA function in health and disease. The goal of my research program is to harness the unprecedented power of CRISPR-Cas systems to create a versatile range of methods to precisely manipulate virtually any RNA, and to use these tools to explore fundamental knowledge gaps in RNA biology. This proposal specifically focuses on addressing the following knowledge gaps: 1) Despite the technological advances in harnessing RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzymes Cas9 and Cas13 for research and clinical applications, we still do not understand the principles of gRNA selection for efficient and tunable RNA-targeting. This problem precludes the facile development of a number of RNA-targeting applications and underscores the need for a thorough interrogation of gRNA selection. Our goal here is to develop a model to predict highly-active gRNAs for Cas9/Cas13 RNA- targeting in human cells. We will use a combination of high-throughput RNA:protein interactome methods, flow- cytometry based gRNA screens and machine learning to precisely define features of highly active RNA-targeting gRNAs for RNA-binding and knockdown for Cas9 and Cas13. 2) The vast majority of human RNAs are alternatively spliced, and RNA splicing defects are common in cancers and neurological diseases. However, our understanding of the downstream functional effects of splicing in a majority of cases is rudimentary. To address this issue, we will develop a toolbox of robust, multiplexable Cas-based splicing factors to offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the functional consequences of alternative splicing. that can determine in a single step both the identity of proteins bound to a And 3) There is a paucity of methods specific RNA and their location on that RNA. The development of such an approach will enable us to determine the spatial arrangement of proteins on specific RNAs to dissect their dynamic deposition in range of RNA processes such as transcription, 3ʹ-end and micro-RNA processing, and lncRNA function. To address this issue, we propose to develop a genetically encodable Cas-based RNA proximity-labeling strategy to precisely identify proteins that bind in close proximity to a specific RNA sequence. We will then use this approach to identify protein factors involved in regulating microprocessor (Drosha/DGCR8) activity at specific primary micro-RNA loci. These research goals fully align with the NIGMS 5 Year Strategic Plan, through the development of essential research tools to study and RNA function for biomedical research. Project Narrative RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas proteins offer an unprecedented opportunity to precisely manipulate RNA biology in ways not currently possible. We propose several innovative approaches to address critical knowledge gaps in CRISPR-Cas tool development and chart a path to use these tools to interrogate several fundamental questions in RNA biology. Our approaches will help us define the gRNA design rules for RNA-targeting Cas proteins, and develop robust new RNA-targeting Cas tools to manipulate RNA splicing and dissect protein- RNA interaction networks, and ultimately, the tools developed here will transform the way we study RNA and will broadly impact the fields of molecular and cell biology.",Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology,9984455,R35GM133462,"['Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Floods ', ' Flooding ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Microprocessor ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Guide RNA ', ' gRNA ', ' RNA Sequences ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' single cell analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' RNA analysis ', ' Micro RNA ', ' miRNA ', ' miRNAs ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' RNA bound ', ' RNA Binding ', ' RNA Processing ', ' BCAR1 ', ' BCAR1 Protein ', ' Breast Cancer Anti-Estrogen Resistance 1 Protein ', ' CKRAS protein ', ' CRK-Associated Substrate ', ' CRKAS ', ' Cas protein ', ' p130 cas protein ', ' p130CAS ', ' BCAR1 gene ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' NIGMS ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' RNA-Protein Interaction ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Transcript ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' tool development ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R35,2020,385000,0.19092726241230593
"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs).

"Developing a robust platform to identify unexpected and novel viruses in human brain tissue Project Summary / Abstract  Central nervous system infections with RNA viruses cause severe neurological deficits and death, and are extremely challenging to diagnose. This multiple PI proposal presents an innovative research program that will provide the foundation for a comprehensive viral diagnostics pipeline to rapidly diagnose RNA virus infections from surgical brain biopsies. The investigators will combine two cutting-edge techniques for viral detection, screening with double-stranded RNA immunohistochemistry (dsRNA IHC) to identify cases with a high likelihood of a viral etiology, and unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for specific virus identification and genome analysis.  To develop the dsRNA IHC screening assay, six commercially available anti-dsRNA antibodies will be optimized in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain tissue and evaluated in a series of known infectious and non-infectious cases. The top candidates will be tested in a set of brain biopsies with inflammation of unclear etiology and compared to results of mNGS performed in parallel. The development of this assay will facilitate efficient screening of FFPE tissue samples from patients with neurological disease of unclear pathogenesis to identify those with a high likelihood of viral etiology. To improve mNGS methods for FFPE brain tissue, new laboratory techniques will be tested to increase the yield and quality of viral RNA extracted. In addition to virus identification, mNGS will be used to perform full-genome deep sequencing of viruses. These results can be applied to molecular epidemiology, disease surveillance, and understanding pathogen-host interactions. Overall, this project will enhance our understanding of RNA viruses that cause CNS infection, inform future studies of virus evolution and pathogenesis, and lay the foundation for the development of a comprehensive viral diagnostics pipeline that will substantially improve the care of patients with devastating CNS infections. This work aligns very well with the NINDS mission to seek and apply fundamental knowledge of the brain to reduce the burden of neurological disease.  This R21 Exploratory Neuroscience Research Grant proposal will support and expand the collaboration between the two PIs. The unique combination of expertise in neuropathology, infectious disease pathology, virology, clinical infectious disease, and metagenomic sequencing demonstrate the requisite skills and perspective needed to achieve the goals of this proposal. The stimulating environments of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard University, and Emory University are extremely well suited to the proposed research plan, which not only provide critical equipment and facilities infrastructure, but also mentorship, formal opportunities to present and discuss results, and eventual venues to implement this clinical testing prospectively. Project Narrative Viral infections of the central nervous system cause significant illness and death, and in many patients the specific virus causing infection is never found. This project will develop new tools to detect viruses in brain tissue, including previously unknown viruses, and sequence their genomes. The objectives of this project are to improve diagnostics for patients with devastating neurological illness, and to open new research directions in studying viruses that cause central nervous system

"New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures RNA molecules play fundamental roles in nearly all cellular processes at the level of gene expression and regulation. Not surprisingly, emerging biomedical advances such as precision medicine and synthetic biology all point to RNA as the central regulators and information carriers. Recently, realizing the potential of using RNA to intervene gene expression, scientists successfully developed Onpattro, the ﬁrst FDA-approved RNA-based therapy in August 2018.  Understanding RNA function and therapeutic applications requires knowledge about RNA structure. Unfortu- nately, currently, the number of the known structures is a small fraction of what need to be determined. This gap has to be closed by computational methods. Furthermore, an RNA molecule is a highly charged polyanion and positive charges such as metal ions bind to an RNA and for an integral part of an RNA structure. Where and how metal ions interact with an RNA can directly impact RNA structure and function as well as RNA-drug interactions.  Continuously supported by NIH for over 15 years, we have developed systematic computational tools for the predictions of RNA structures, folding stability, kinetics, and metal ion effects. These tools have led to fruitful applications in virology, microbiology, gene therapy, RNA biotechnology, and various RNA-based therapeutic de- signs. However, despite over decade of efforts, many critical issues in computational RNA biology still remain: de novo prediction of non-Watson-Crick interactions, structure prediction for large RNAs, effective incorporation of experimental data such as cryo-EM and NMR data into structure prediction, and modeling of metal ion ef- fects. In this grant, after 15 years of developing an initio physics-based models, we propose to target the above and other pressing issues using a fundamentally different approach by systematically developing data-driven (such as deep-learning) or hybrid data-driven/physics-based simulation methods. The new approaches are mo- tivated by the increasing amount of experimental data and the pressing need to have more efﬁcient and reliable computational tools for data interpretation, especially for structure determination experiments. We will use ex- perimental database, such as RNA-Puzzles database, PDB, EMDataBank, BMRB, for large-scale benchmark tests, and biochemical and NMR data collected by our well-established collaborators for in-depth and interactive information about various experiments such as HCV genomic RNAs and HIV PBS systems. Our goal, if success- fully accomplished, will immediately impact experiments such as structure determination, including cryo-EM and NMR-based structure determination, identiﬁcation of metal ion sites, and rational design of RNA structures for therapeutic applications. RNA structures and interactions hold the key to many important biological processes. This project develops cutting-edge computational methods for the predictions of RNA structures and interactions. The results from the project will lead to novel computational tools for understanding disease mechanism at molecular level and for the rational design of RNA-based therapeutics. !",New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures,9851572,R35GM134919,"['Biology ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Charge ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' gene therapy ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' genomic therapy ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hybrids ', ' Ions ', ' Kinetics ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Physics ', ' Play ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' virology ', ' polyanion ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Biochemical ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' success ', ' Cryo-electron Microscopy ', ' Electron Cryomicroscopy ', ' cryo-EM ', ' cryoEM ', ' Cryoelectron Microscopy ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Modeling ', ' RNA Computations ', ' Metal Ion Binding ', ' Data ', ' Molecular ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' synthetic biology ', ' FDA approved ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' genomic RNA ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' HCV ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' deep learning ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2020,240392,0.18503848888570826
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is entitled “Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning.” A number of in- terrelated computational methods for making predictions about the biological behavior of small molecules have been the subject of development within the Jain Laboratory for over twenty years. These share a common strat- egy that considers molecular interactions at their surface interface, where proteins and ligands actually interact. These methods yield measurements of similarity between small molecules or between protein binding pockets. They also yield measurements of the complementarity of a small molecule to a protein binding site (the molecular docking problem). A generalization of these concepts makes possible the construction of a virtual binding site for quantitative activity prediction purely from data about the biological activities of a set of small molecules.  The goals of the proposed work include further improving the accuracy and breadth of applicability of the binding site modeling approach. The primary application of the approach is to guide optimization of leads within medicinal chemistry projects, and to quantify potential off-target effects during pre-clinical drug discovery.  A critical focus of the work will be in data and software dissemination, in order to accelerate the efficient development of targeted therapies. In addition to methods development, the proposed work will involve broad application of these state-of-the-art predictive modeling methods. The proposed work will proceed with the col- laborative input of our pharmaceutical industry colleagues, who have specialized knowledge and data sets that are vital for cutting-edge work in computer-aided drug design.  The expected results include more efficient lead optimization (fewer compounds to reach desired biological pa- rameters), truly effective scaffold replacement (to move away from a molecular series with biological limitations), and improved computational predictions of off-target effects during pre-clinical drug design. Project Narrative This project seeks to refine an integrated platform for physically realistic prediction of ligand binding affinities using multiple methods that span small molecule molecular similarity, molecular docking, and protein binding site similarity. These tools will provide predictive modeling unrestrained by scaffold congruence between what is known and what is to be predicted. Prediction of bioactive molecular poses and activities to guide lead optimiza- tion and to quantify off-target liability effects are applications of the effort, and data and software will be made widely available to academic and industrial research groups.",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,9904662,R01GM101689,"['Behavior ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Charge ', ' Pharmaceutical Chemistry ', ' Medicinal Chemistry ', ' Pharmaceutic Chemistry ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Drug Design ', ' Drug Industry ', ' Pharmaceutic Industry ', ' Pharmaceutical Industry ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hydrogen Bonding ', ' H-bond ', ' Industrialization ', ' Laboratories ', ' Ligands ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Molecular Probes ', ' Physics ', ' Protein Conformation ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Surface ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Chemicals ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Electrostatics ', ' Knowledge ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' physical model ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' drug discovery ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' Affinity ', ' Data ', ' Industry Collaborators ', ' Industry Collaboration ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Docking ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' virtual ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' charges for treatment ', ' treatment charges ', ' treatment fees ', ' blind ', ' combinatorial ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' Formulation ', ' lead optimization ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,310202,0.03535836793375995
"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood. This proposal aims to simulate the binding process of TNF ligands with their receptors on cell surfaces by multi-scale computational methods. TNF receptors are the common drug targets for autoimmune diseases. Understand their cellular mechanism of binding therefore is highly relevant to public health.",Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces,9983105,R01GM122804,"['Affect ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cadherins ', ' Cell Adhesion ', ' Cellular Adhesion ', ' Cell membrane ', ' Cytoplasmic Membrane ', ' Plasma Membrane ', ' plasmalemma ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chimera organism ', ' Chimera ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' computational simulation ', ' computerized simulation ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Environment ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Goals ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leukocytes ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' White Cell ', ' white blood cell ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' Ligands ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Fluorescence Microscopy ', ' Fluorescence Light Microscopy ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Swelling ', ' Testing ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factors ', ' TNF Receptor Ligands ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Family Protein ', ' Weight ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor ', ' Cachectin Receptors ', ' TNF Receptor Family Protein ', ' TNF Receptor Superfamily ', ' TNF Receptors ', ' TNFR ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Family ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily ', ' cytokine ', ' Mediating ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Protein Binding ', ' bound protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Cell Surface Proteins ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Host Defense ', ' extracellular ', ' interest ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' Physical Phenomena or Properties ', ' physical process ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' receptor bound ', ' receptor binding ', ' Cellular injury ', ' cell damage ', ' cellular damage ', ' damage to cells ', ' injury to cells ', ' cell injury ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Cell surface ', ' (TNF)-α ', ' Cachectin ', ' Macrophage-Derived TNF ', ' Monocyte-Derived TNF ', ' TNF ', ' TNF A ', ' TNF Alpha ', ' TNF-α ', ' TNFA ', ' TNFα ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ', ' TNF gene ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Protein Databases ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' protein complex ', ' Homo ', ' tumor necrosis factor receptor binding ', ' Affinity ', ' Avidity ', ' Mutate ', ' Resolution ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Tumor Process ', ' Tumor-Associated Process ', ' Validation ', ' Whole Organism ', ' Molecular ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' multiscale modeling ', ' multi-scale modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' pathogen ', ' NH2-terminal ', ' N-terminal ', ' large-scale data base ', ' large-scale database ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Innate Immune System ', ' recruit ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NIGMS,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,327738,0.05461592269701534
"RNA Sequencing Via Single Reverse Transcript Assessments Project Summary While very substantial progress has been made over the last 10 or so years with regards to next generation sequencing (NGS) and third generation sequencing (TGS) of DNA, the development of novel and enabling tool sets for RNA sequencing has lagged significantly. During this project, we aim to make significant progress with regards to that gap by developing and validating an entirely new solid-state sequencing platform, developed specifically and ideally for direct RNA sequencing, including its structural complexities and nucleotide modifications, all with high accuracy. While there are over 100 known RNA nucleotide modifications, due to the lack of analytical characterization methods available, the exact roles of these modifications remain to be determined. The technology that will be developed during the project will be capable of elucidating the roles of these modifications, and revolutionizing our understanding and use of the transcriptome/epitranscriptome. Project Narrative A method/technology capable of directly (without transcription) sequencing RNA, with extremely high accuracy and the inherent ability to identify nucleotide modifications, has the potential to revolutionize the use of the transcriptome and epitranscriptome, radically change standard R&D practices, as well as enable revolutionary diagnostics and therapeutics.

"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9987332,R35GM118070,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biology ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Learning ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' viral RNA ', ' virus RNA ', ' Travel ', ' virology ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' macromolecule ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Cell Components ', ' Cell Structure ', ' Cellular Structures ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' Ribosomal Peptide Biosynthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Biosynthesis ', ' Ribosomal Protein Synthesis ', ' protein synthesis ', ' Protein Biosynthesis ', ' structural biology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Resolution ', ' Molecular ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' Outcome ', ' human disease ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biological systems ', ' structured data ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2020,585552,0.1842665286905121
