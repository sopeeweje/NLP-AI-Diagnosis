"Computational methods for regional hippocampal morphometry in AD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI is a quantitative researcher with a background in computer science and a record of publications in the areas of image analysis methodology, computer vision and machine learning. His objective is to establish himself as a highly productive independent researcher of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia by complimenting his strengths in quantitative analysis with a newly acquired expertise in the biomedical aspects of dementia and aging. Prof. John Detre MD, the head of Penn's Center for Functional Neuroimaging and an internationally renowned neurologist, has offered to serve as the principal mentor. The co-sponsors, Prof. John Trojanowski, MD, PhD and Prof. Murray Grossman, MD, EdD have offered to help the PI acquire expertise in the pathology and physiology of dementia as well as its impact on memory, language and thinking. The research plan involves developing an advanced framework for detecting and tracking structural and functional changes in the anatomical subregions of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus using in vivo neuroimaging. Using this framework, the PI will evaluate the hypotheses that AD-related changes differ across the anatomical subregions of these temporal lobe structures and, consequently, that their morphology and physiology can be used to predict AD early and accurately. These hypotheses will be tested by mining the massive database of longitudinal MRI image data of AD patients, people at risk for AD and elderly controls, which is being generated by the ADNI initiative launched recently by the NIA/NIH.

"AD classification algorithms using ADNI multi-modal image data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A major emphasis in recent Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is identifying features and avenues for early intervention in the preclinical state of AD.  This is essential because by the time a patient exhibits symptomatic dementia, millions of neurons in the brain have already been lost.  Advanced imaging methods that enable visualization of AD associated brain changes at an early stage are likely to play an important role in detecting the onset of neurodegeneration early, prior to extensive neural loss.  In parallel, automated image analysis algorithms must be developed to enable not only accurate localization and characterization of changes but also identify patterns from the data to enable individual subject diagnosis.  Recent results suggest that this may indeed be possible using machine learning techniques:  sensitivity and specificity of around 85% have been obtained by several groups using either T1-weighted MR (Magnetic Resonance), FDG PET (18fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography), or other modalities.  The availability of multiple imaging modalities for longitudinally followed subjects within the ADNI data now offers the opportunity of significant improvements in sensitivity/specificity of diagnostic tools for AD.  This can be achieved by developing new mathematical models to leverage multiple imaging modalities and longitudinal data in conjunction-for accurate diagnosis as well as to aid in analyzing the effect of new treatments, as they become available.  Hypothesis:  Significant improvements in accuracy (sensitivity/specificity) for discriminating AD, MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment), and healthy controls (at the level of individual subjects) are possible by making use of multiple imaging modalities and longitudinal data.  Specific Aims:  (1) To develop new image-based classification algorithms that can take advantage of multiple imaging modalities simultaneously within a unified framework; and to extensively evaluate these methods on the entire ADNI image dataset.  (2) To extend our algorithms to incorporate longitudinal image data for further improvements and perform evaluation on ADNI image data.  (3) To design and disseminate an open source software system to assist in AD diagnosis.  Methods:  We have recently developed a new machine learning based algorithm for AD classification that gives 85% sensitivity/specificity in correctly identifying AD patients from healthy controls using T1-weighted MR images from ADNI, and over 80% classification sensitivity/specificity using FDG PET images.  Building on these efforts, we will extend and improve our models to utilize multi-modal image data (Specific Aim 1).  The algorithms will be further augmented with longitudinal data to enable more accurate prediction for difficult to diagnose cases (Specific Aim 2).  We will extensively evaluate the stepwise improvements of our method on the ADNI dataset and perform statistical evaluations of the relationship of measures such as the classification confidence with various cognitive/laboratory biomarkers available within ADNI.  These algorithms will be implemented and disseminated via an easy to use software system to facilitate AD diagnosis (Specific Aim 3).  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research will develop novel algorithms and software systems for highly accurate Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.  The techniques will take advantage of the individual's brain images from two or more imaging modalities-such as structural images (e.g., Magnetic Resonance) and functional images (e.g., Positron Emission Tomography).  The algorithms and software as a result of successful completion of this project will combine the multi-modal image information with the longitudinal data of the patient (if available) to provide invaluable assistance in AD diagnosis at the level of individual subjects.       The proposed research will develop novel algorithms and software systems for highly accurate Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

"GENOMEWIDE ANALYSIS OF INTERACTIONS IN ALZHEIMER DISEASE USING NEURAL NETWORKS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly.

"Computational methods for regional hippocampal morphometry in AD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI is a quantitative researcher with a background in computer science and a record of publications in the areas of image analysis methodology, computer vision and machine learning. His objective is to establish himself as a highly productive independent researcher of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia by complimenting his strengths in quantitative analysis with a newly acquired expertise in the biomedical aspects of dementia and aging. Prof. John Detre MD, the head of Penn's Center for Functional Neuroimaging and an internationally renowned neurologist, has offered to serve as the principal mentor. The co-sponsors, Prof. John Trojanowski, MD, PhD and Prof. Murray Grossman, MD, EdD have offered to help the PI acquire expertise in the pathology and physiology of dementia as well as its impact on memory, language and thinking. The research plan involves developing an advanced framework for detecting and tracking structural and functional changes in the anatomical subregions of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus using in vivo neuroimaging. Using this framework, the PI will evaluate the hypotheses that AD-related changes differ across the anatomical subregions of these temporal lobe structures and, consequently, that their morphology and physiology can be used to predict AD early and accurately. These hypotheses will be tested by mining the massive database of longitudinal MRI image data of AD patients, people at risk for AD and elderly controls, which is being generated by the ADNI initiative launched recently by the NIA/NIH. RELEVANCE. As the baby boom generation ages, the number of US families devastated by AD and the associated financial burden on the society is expected to increase dramatically.

"AD classification algorithms using ADNI multi-modal image data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A major emphasis in recent Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is identifying features and avenues for early intervention in the preclinical state of AD.  This is essential because by the time a patient exhibits symptomatic dementia, millions of neurons in the brain have already been lost.  Advanced imaging methods that enable visualization of AD associated brain changes at an early stage are likely to play an important role in detecting the onset of neurodegeneration early, prior to extensive neural loss.  In parallel, automated image analysis algorithms must be developed to enable not only accurate localization and characterization of changes but also identify patterns from the data to enable individual subject diagnosis.  Recent results suggest that this may indeed be possible using machine learning techniques:  sensitivity and specificity of around 85% have been obtained by several groups using either T1-weighted MR (Magnetic Resonance), FDG PET (18fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography), or other modalities.  The availability of multiple imaging modalities for longitudinally followed subjects within the ADNI data now offers the opportunity of significant improvements in sensitivity/specificity of diagnostic tools for AD.  This can be achieved by developing new mathematical models to leverage multiple imaging modalities and longitudinal data in conjunction-for accurate diagnosis as well as to aid in analyzing the effect of new treatments, as they become available.  Hypothesis:  Significant improvements in accuracy (sensitivity/specificity) for discriminating AD, MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment), and healthy controls (at the level of individual subjects) are possible by making use of multiple imaging modalities and longitudinal data.  Specific Aims:  (1) To develop new image-based classification algorithms that can take advantage of multiple imaging modalities simultaneously within a unified framework; and to extensively evaluate these methods on the entire ADNI image dataset.  (2) To extend our algorithms to incorporate longitudinal image data for further improvements and perform evaluation on ADNI image data.  (3) To design and disseminate an open source software system to assist in AD diagnosis.  Methods:  We have recently developed a new machine learning based algorithm for AD classification that gives 85% sensitivity/specificity in correctly identifying AD patients from healthy controls using T1-weighted MR images from ADNI, and over 80% classification sensitivity/specificity using FDG PET images.  Building on these efforts, we will extend and improve our models to utilize multi-modal image data (Specific Aim 1).  The algorithms will be further augmented with longitudinal data to enable more accurate prediction for difficult to diagnose cases (Specific Aim 2).  We will extensively evaluate the stepwise improvements of our method on the ADNI dataset and perform statistical evaluations of the relationship of measures such as the classification confidence with various cognitive/laboratory biomarkers available within ADNI.  These algorithms will be implemented and disseminated via an easy to use software system to facilitate AD diagnosis (Specific Aim 3).  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research will develop novel algorithms and software systems for highly accurate Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.  The techniques will take advantage of the individual's brain images from two or more imaging modalities-such as structural images (e.g., Magnetic Resonance) and functional images (e.g., Positron Emission Tomography).  The algorithms and software as a result of successful completion of this project will combine the multi-modal image information with the longitudinal data of the patient (if available) to provide invaluable assistance in AD diagnosis at the level of individual subjects.        The proposed research will develop novel algorithms and software systems for highly accurate Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

"Computational neuroanatomy of aging and AD via pattern analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our previous work on computational neuroanatomy of aging, and investigates the use of advanced pattern analysis methods in early detection of imaging phenotypes of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). AD is a disease of rapidly increasing prevalence and clinical significance, in an aging population. Currently available diagnostic tests detect the disease at extremely late stages, perhaps more than a decade after it first begins to develop. A variety of imaging methods offers great promise for the detection of early signs of brain change, which can be indicative of future clinical progression to AD. However structural and functional imaging patterns characteristic of AD are subtle, spatially complex, evolving dynamically with age/time, and are overlaid on changes induced by normal aging. This raises the need for sophisticated methods for image analysis and pattern recognition. Towards this goal, Aim 3 integrates high-dimensional pattern analysis and recognition methods aiming to quantitatively describe imaging patterns that have diagnostic and predictive value. Since these patterns can be spatially complex and subtle, conventional image analysis methods can be challenged. We therefore build on the state of the art of machine learning and pattern recognition, focusing on the major challenge encountered in medical imaging: high dimensionality of imaging data relative to the available sample sizes. Optimal multi-parametric feature construction and dimensionality reduction methods are necessary to meet this challenge and are considered in Aim 2 along with multi-parametric classification and clustering methods. The foundation of the pattern analysis of the work in Aim 3 is also set in Aim 1, which deals with more ""low-level"" fundamental image analysis problem: registration, which is a process that places image data to a standardized coordinate system, thereby enabling statistical analysis of spatio-temporal imaging patterns across healthy and patient populations: an optimal mathematical representation of morphological data is developed via a group-wise registration process. We apply this method to structural, functional and amyloid deposition image data from two of the largest studies of normal aging (BLSA) and AD (ADNI).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer's Disease poses a major medical and socioeconomic problem, which becomes increasingly prevalent as the population lives longer.

"Maximizing Power in AD Clinical Trials via Multimodal Machine Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An emphasis in ongoing Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is identifying those biomarkers which best predict future cognitive decline at the various stages of disease progression. These biomarkers can then serve as early markers for diagnosis, and for selection of subjects into clinical trials. Recent results suggest that the identification of such discriminative biomarkers is possible by adapting machine learning methods for this problem: but studies have primarily used modalities in isolation so far. The sensitivity/specificity offered by these methods is unsatisfactory for more clinically relevant questions: which MCI patients will convert to AD? Answering such questions requires new methods that leverage all data sources (e.g., imaging modalities, CSF measures) in conjunction. This project focuses on how data from multiple biomarkers should be optimally aggregated to best predict future cognitive decline, and how these models can improve clinical trials for AD. Hypothesis: Significant improvements in sensitivity and specificity for discriminating AD, MCI, and healthy controls at the level of individual subjects are possible by making use of multiple modalities (together with longitudinal data) simultaneously. Further, these methods will significantly improve sample size estimates in clinical trials, and help derive customized outcomes for evaluating new treatment procedures. Specific Aims: (1) To develop new image-based machine learning algorithms that can take advantage of multiple modalities simultaneously within a unified framework. (2) To provide a software and extensively evaluate these methods on the ADNI and BLSA datasets, to assess the sensitivity/specificity attainable by truly multi-modal analysis methods. (3) To interface multi-modal classification methods with AD clinical trials: (a) by developing comprehensive sample size estimates needed to observe specific outcomes, and using these methods to derive customized outcomes for an ongoing R01-funded observational/prospective study here at the Wisconsin ADRC. Methods: We will develop new multi-modal machine learning methods that will optimally exploit all data sources simultaneously. Our models will also incorporate longitudinal data, and exploit interaction between modalities at different stages of the disease. This will be used to derive a Multi-Modal Disease Marker (MMDM) (Aim 1). The algorithms will be evaluated on large-scale well-characterized datasets and provided as software tools (Aim 2). We will use these models to improve AD clinical trials in two ways: by sample enrichment and customized outcomes that provide maximum statistical power to detect treatment effects (Aim 3). Significance: This project capitalizes on the Wisconsin ADRC's expertise in machine learning, statistical clinical trial design, imaging, and clinical diagnosis of AD and pre-AD conditions. This project will be the first to implement a multi-modal machine learning metric specifically designed to speed up clinical trials so that potential therapies can be evaluated and an effective treatment arrived at as quickly as possible.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop novel methods and software systems for highly accurate and automated identification of patterns related to Alzheimer's disease. The techniques will take advantage of the aggregate information from an individual's brain images from multiple imaging modalities such as structural images (e.g., Magnetic Resonance) and functional images (e.g., Positron Emission Tomography), as well as cognitive and demographic information. The software, as a result of successful completion of this project, will provide invaluable assistance in AD diagnosis (and predicting cognitive decline) at the level of individual subjects, as well as allow clinical experiments to be more effective in evaluating which drugs and treatments are effective for such neurological disorders.                  This project will develop novel methods and software systems for highly accurate and automated identification of patterns related to Alzheimer's disease.

"MRI, Genetics & Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application of the MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia compares which of 3 approaches for diagnosing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is best at accurately predicting incident clinical dementia. Of the two primary diagnostic methods currently used, psychometrically defined and clinical determined, application of criteria for psychometrically defined has been most variable. Further, a novel algorithmic method is emerging as an alternative unbiased approach. Using commonly applied clinical tools of cognitive performance and brain structure obtained from baseline and repeat administration of neuropsychological (NP) tests and magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) scans, this proposed project will first determine what profile of cross-sectional or longitudinal neuropsychological tests and threshold performance levels, combined with imaging markers is the most efficacious in predicting progression to dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Another set of analyses will test the algorithmic method. The diagnostic models that emerge from these two sets of analyses will then be compared to diagnoses of MCI using standard clinical criteria to determine which of the three methods best predicts incident dementia. The clinical diagnoses of MCI and dementia are available through a separately funded initiative. Also central to this grant proposal is the inclusion of external seasoned investigators, who will provid their expertise in definition and study of MCI and the factors influencing progression to disease. This effort aims to provide enhanced sensitivity in application of NP and MRI tools to detect subtle impairment at an earlier stage on the preclinical continuum and improved specificity in determining the MCI subtypes most highly associated with AD versus other types of dementia. Increased MCI diagnostic accuracy will enhance opportunity for more effective interventions, which have been largely disappointing to date, and could eventually leading to a delay in the onset or prevention of the clinical expression of AD.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia seeks to identify the most effective method and criteria for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that is best predictive of incident Alzheimer's disease. Current efforts to treat AD have been ineffective because intervention occurs too late in the insidious process. The potential public health relevance of this proposed project is increased accuracy of diagnosis at the preclinical stage, where treatment opportunities may prove to be more successful and prevention is most feasible.                  The MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia seeks to identify the most effective method and criteria for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that is best predictive of incident Alzheimer's disease.

"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Computational neuroanatomy of aging and AD via pattern analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our previous work on computational neuroanatomy of aging, and investigates the use of advanced pattern analysis methods in early detection of imaging phenotypes of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). AD is a disease of rapidly increasing prevalence and clinical significance, in an aging population. Currently available diagnostic tests detect the disease at extremely late stages, perhaps more than a decade after it first begins to develop. A variety of imaging methods offers great promise for the detection of early signs of brain change, which can be indicative of future clinical progression to AD. However structural and functional imaging patterns characteristic of AD are subtle, spatially complex, evolving dynamically with age/time, and are overlaid on changes induced by normal aging. This raises the need for sophisticated methods for image analysis and pattern recognition. Towards this goal, Aim 3 integrates high-dimensional pattern analysis and recognition methods aiming to quantitatively describe imaging patterns that have diagnostic and predictive value. Since these patterns can be spatially complex and subtle, conventional image analysis methods can be challenged. We therefore build on the state of the art of machine learning and pattern recognition, focusing on the major challenge encountered in medical imaging: high dimensionality of imaging data relative to the available sample sizes. Optimal multi-parametric feature construction and dimensionality reduction methods are necessary to meet this challenge and are considered in Aim 2 along with multi-parametric classification and clustering methods. The foundation of the pattern analysis of the work in Aim 3 is also set in Aim 1, which deals with more ""low-level"" fundamental image analysis problem: registration, which is a process that places image data to a standardized coordinate system, thereby enabling statistical analysis of spatio-temporal imaging patterns across healthy and patient populations: an optimal mathematical representation of morphological data is developed via a group-wise registration process. We apply this method to structural, functional and amyloid deposition image data from two of the largest studies of normal aging (BLSA) and AD (ADNI).        Alzheimer's Disease poses a major medical and socioeconomic problem, which becomes increasingly prevalent as the population lives longer. This project develops and applies computer methods for multi-parametric analysis of MRI and PET scans, aiming to detect very early markers of the disease. As patterns of brain change are complex, subtle, and occur in tandem with normal changes brought by healthy aging, they are extremely difficult to detect at early stages, during which effective treatments are likely to exist in the near future. Advanced methods for pattern analysis and recognition have shown high promise in terms of measuring and detecting such early changes. This project will contribute such methods to the field. It will also apply them to two of the largest studies of normal aging and Alzheimer's disease: BLSA and ADNI.

"Maximizing Power in AD Clinical Trials via Multimodal Machine Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An emphasis in ongoing Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is identifying those biomarkers which best predict future cognitive decline at the various stages of disease progression. These biomarkers can then serve as early markers for diagnosis, and for selection of subjects into clinical trials. Recent results suggest that the identification of such discriminative biomarkers is possible by adapting machine learning methods for this problem: but studies have primarily used modalities in isolation so far. The sensitivity/specificity offered by these methods is unsatisfactory for more clinically relevant questions: which MCI patients will convert to AD? Answering such questions requires new methods that leverage all data sources (e.g., imaging modalities, CSF measures) in conjunction. This project focuses on how data from multiple biomarkers should be optimally aggregated to best predict future cognitive decline, and how these models can improve clinical trials for AD. Hypothesis: Significant improvements in sensitivity and specificity for discriminating AD, MCI, and healthy controls at the level of individual subjects are possible by making use of multiple modalities (together with longitudinal data) simultaneously. Further, these methods will significantly improve sample size estimates in clinical trials, and help derive customized outcomes for evaluating new treatment procedures. Specific Aims: (1) To develop new image-based machine learning algorithms that can take advantage of multiple modalities simultaneously within a unified framework. (2) To provide a software and extensively evaluate these methods on the ADNI and BLSA datasets, to assess the sensitivity/specificity attainable by truly multi-modal analysis methods. (3) To interface multi-modal classification methods with AD clinical trials: (a) by developing comprehensive sample size estimates needed to observe specific outcomes, and using these methods to derive customized outcomes for an ongoing R01-funded observational/prospective study here at the Wisconsin ADRC. Methods: We will develop new multi-modal machine learning methods that will optimally exploit all data sources simultaneously. Our models will also incorporate longitudinal data, and exploit interaction between modalities at different stages of the disease. This will be used to derive a Multi-Modal Disease Marker (MMDM) (Aim 1). The algorithms will be evaluated on large-scale well-characterized datasets and provided as software tools (Aim 2). We will use these models to improve AD clinical trials in two ways: by sample enrichment and customized outcomes that provide maximum statistical power to detect treatment effects (Aim 3). Significance: This project capitalizes on the Wisconsin ADRC's expertise in machine learning, statistical clinical trial design, imaging, and clinical diagnosis of AD and pre-AD conditions. This project will be the first to implement a multi-modal machine learning metric specifically designed to speed up clinical trials so that potential therapies can be evaluated and an effective treatment arrived at as quickly as possible.          This project will develop novel methods and software systems for highly accurate and automated identification of patterns related to Alzheimer's disease. The techniques will take advantage of the aggregate information from an individual's brain images from multiple imaging modalities such as structural images (e.g., Magnetic Resonance) and functional images (e.g., Positron Emission Tomography), as well as cognitive and demographic information. The software, as a result of successful completion of this project, will provide invaluable assistance in AD diagnosis (and predicting cognitive decline) at the level of individual subjects, as well as allow clinical experiments to be more effective in evaluating which drugs and treatments are effective for such neurological disorders.

"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables.          Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"MRI, Genetics & Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application of the MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia compares which of 3 approaches for diagnosing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is best at accurately predicting incident clinical dementia. Of the two primary diagnostic methods currently used, psychometrically defined and clinical determined, application of criteria for psychometrically defined has been most variable. Further, a novel algorithmic method is emerging as an alternative unbiased approach. Using commonly applied clinical tools of cognitive performance and brain structure obtained from baseline and repeat administration of neuropsychological (NP) tests and magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) scans, this proposed project will first determine what profile of cross-sectional or longitudinal neuropsychological tests and threshold performance levels, combined with imaging markers is the most efficacious in predicting progression to dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Another set of analyses will test the algorithmic method. The diagnostic models that emerge from these two sets of analyses will then be compared to diagnoses of MCI using standard clinical criteria to determine which of the three methods best predicts incident dementia. The clinical diagnoses of MCI and dementia are available through a separately funded initiative. Also central to this grant proposal is the inclusion of external seasoned investigators, who will provid their expertise in definition and study of MCI and the factors influencing progression to disease. This effort aims to provide enhanced sensitivity in application of NP and MRI tools to detect subtle impairment at an earlier stage on the preclinical continuum and improved specificity in determining the MCI subtypes most highly associated with AD versus other types of dementia. Increased MCI diagnostic accuracy will enhance opportunity for more effective interventions, which have been largely disappointing to date, and could eventually leading to a delay in the onset or prevention of the clinical expression of AD.          The MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia seeks to identify the most effective method and criteria for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that is best predictive of incident Alzheimer's disease. Current efforts to treat AD have been ineffective because intervention occurs too late in the insidious process. The potential public health relevance of this proposed project is increased accuracy of diagnosis at the preclinical stage, where treatment opportunities may prove to be more successful and prevention is most feasible.

"Early detection of asymptomatic middle-age adults at risk for AD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a pressing public health need to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its earliest, asymptomatic, stages. This would immensely facilitate the conduct of targeted clinical trials, the development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents, and, ultimately, the curtailment of the looming epidemic that AD poses. Such an endeavor necessarily requires a multidisciplinary team of investigators with complementary areas of expertise. The goal of this Beeson Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award in Aging (K23) proposal is to provide the candidate with the experience, knowledge, and skillset necessary to carry out high quality, clinically- relevant, aging research so that he might effectively participate in and lead such a multidisciplinary group in the future. The proposal, therefore, comprises a unified set of research and training activities that are well-tuned to the candidate's transition from a K23 trainee to an independent investigator. The training plan seamlessly combines meetings with mentors, formal coursework, didactic activities, hands-on training, leadership training, and professional development. Specific training goals include: (1) cultivate a more nuanced understanding of aging and geriatric cognitive disorders, (2) receive dedicated training in neuroimaging methods, (3) develop advanced neuroimaging data analytic expertise, (4) receive ongoing training in the responsible conduct of research, and (5) obtain the career guidance needed for successful transition from the K23 to an independent research career, and maturation into a future leader in the neuroimaging of preclinical AD. In turn, the overall objectives of the research project are to use novel multi-modality machine learning techniques to specify the characteristic pattern of brain changes that is distinctive of persons in  Stage 3 preclinical AD (the stage hypothesized to impart the greatest risk of future progression to AD), and then determine whether asymptomatic, middle-aged adults who exhibit such brain changes are more likely to experience future cognitive decline. These objectives are directly relevant to the global effort to halt AD via early detection of cognitively-healthy persons at high  risk for progressing to AD. This is because current national guidelines for detecting risk for AD i asymptomatic persons call for extensive evaluations (e.g., nuclear imaging and lumbar puncture) that are expensive, not always well-tolerated by research volunteers and, more importantly, not widely available. In contrast, this project will rigorously assess brain changes i Stage 3 preclinical AD using routine, non-invasive, and broadly-deployable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of brain structure and blood flow. A specific deliverable of this project is the derivation of a single, quantitative, abnormality score that can be used-in combination with pertinent health information-for identifying, on an individual level, asymptomatic persons at heightened risk for AD. Such persons may then benefit from more extensive AD biomarker testing, closer monitoring, and treatment with disease-modifying drugs when such drugs become available. The project's success has material potential to significantly extend the public health reach of the proposed guidelines for defining preclinical AD. The three specific aims addressed in this project are: (1) specify the pattern of brain changes on MRI that is characteristic of Stage 3 preclinical AD, (2) prospectively assess the prognostic utility of an aggregate measure of midlife structural-functional MRI brain changes, and (3) preliminarily evaluate how individual differences related to cognitive reserve and genetic risk modify the association between early brain changes and future decline. Completion of the interrelated set of research and training activities proposed in this K23 will greatly foster the candidate's development into an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in conducting translational and multidisciplinary neuroimaging studies of preclinical AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To forestall the looming AD epidemic, there is need for highly sensitive yet easily deployable methods for identifying cognitively-healthy persons at high risk for AD. This project responds to this public health imperative by pursuing the development of an MRI aggregate measure that is grounded by established AD biomarkers, and is predictive of future cognitive decline in asymptomatic middle-aged adults.",Early detection of asymptomatic middle-age adults at risk for AD,8593003,K23AG045957,"['Future ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' Adult ', ' Health ',

"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables.          Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Maximizing Power in AD Clinical Trials via Multimodal Machine Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An emphasis in ongoing Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is identifying those biomarkers which best predict future cognitive decline at the various stages of disease progression. These biomarkers can then serve as early markers for diagnosis, and for selection of subjects into clinical trials. Recent results suggest that the identification of such discriminative biomarkers is possible by adapting machine learning methods for this problem: but studies have primarily used modalities in isolation so far. The sensitivity/specificity offered by these methods is unsatisfactory for more clinically relevant questions: which MCI patients will convert to AD? Answering such questions requires new methods that leverage all data sources (e.g., imaging modalities, CSF measures) in conjunction. This project focuses on how data from multiple biomarkers should be optimally aggregated to best predict future cognitive decline, and how these models can improve clinical trials for AD. Hypothesis: Significant improvements in sensitivity and specificity for discriminating AD, MCI, and healthy controls at the level of individual subjects are possible by making use of multiple modalities (together with longitudinal data) simultaneously. Further, these methods will significantly improve sample size estimates in clinical trials, and help derive customized outcomes for evaluating new treatment procedures. Specific Aims: (1) To develop new image-based machine learning algorithms that can take advantage of multiple modalities simultaneously within a unified framework. (2) To provide a software and extensively evaluate these methods on the ADNI and BLSA datasets, to assess the sensitivity/specificity attainable by truly multi-modal analysis methods. (3) To interface multi-modal classification methods with AD clinical trials: (a) by developing comprehensive sample size estimates needed to observe specific outcomes, and using these methods to derive customized outcomes for an ongoing R01-funded observational/prospective study here at the Wisconsin ADRC. Methods: We will develop new multi-modal machine learning methods that will optimally exploit all data sources simultaneously. Our models will also incorporate longitudinal data, and exploit interaction between modalities at different stages of the disease. This will be used to derive a Multi-Modal Disease Marker (MMDM) (Aim 1). The algorithms will be evaluated on large-scale well-characterized datasets and provided as software tools (Aim 2). We will use these models to improve AD clinical trials in two ways: by sample enrichment and customized outcomes that provide maximum statistical power to detect treatment effects (Aim 3). Significance: This project capitalizes on the Wisconsin ADRC's expertise in machine learning, statistical clinical trial design, imaging, and clinical diagnosis of AD and pre-AD conditions. This project will be the first to implement a multi-modal machine learning metric specifically designed to speed up clinical trials so that potential therapies can be evaluated and an effective treatment arrived at as quickly as possible.          This project will develop novel methods and software systems for highly accurate and automated identification of patterns related to Alzheimer's disease. The techniques will take advantage of the aggregate information from an individual's brain images from multiple imaging modalities such as structural images (e.g., Magnetic Resonance) and functional images (e.g., Positron Emission Tomography), as well as cognitive and demographic information. The software, as a result of successful completion of this project, will provide invaluable assistance in AD diagnosis (and predicting cognitive decline) at the level of individual subjects, as well as allow clinical experiments to be more effective in evaluating which drugs and treatments are effective for such neurological disorders.

"Growth factors, neuroinflammation, exercise, and brain integrity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aging brain suffers from progressive brain tissue loss, putting hundreds of millions of us at risk for memory loss and dementia with no known cure. We recently discovered, in studies related to physical activity, growth factors, and homocysteine, several new leads about what may promote brain integrity. These variables interact with each other, with inflammation, and with brain structure and disease risk in complex and striking ways. To resist the looming epidemic of degenerative disease, we must determine how such variables deter brain decline. We will map, with unprecedented sensitivity, how these vital processes, which are targetable with interventions, relate to brain structure. We also combine brain measures to predict, with machine learning who will imminently decline. We relate brain and cognitive decline in 3 populations to (1) an inflammatory marker and related neurodegenerative risk genes, (2) growth factor and homocysteine levels, and (3) physical exercise. We will discover how these variables interact to promote or deter brain disease, in our regions of interest (ROIs) - the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and cingulate gyrus. This work is crucial to combat diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia (SZ), among others that are both related to these variables and marked by deficits in these ROIs. We will also survey the whole brain with novel brain mapping methods. Physical activity promotes human brain regeneration in these regions, in part through its effects on growth factors. It decreases inflammation and homocysteine levels, both of which relate to hippocampal integrity. Our project will boost power in clinical trials by identifying targetable disease-driving mechanisms. Building on our recent discoveries, we use (1) genotyped variants in inflammation-related genes, (2) a controllable ""environmental"" variable (exercise), and (3) peripheral measures related to inflammation, neurogenesis, and homocysteine to assess integrity of the hippocampus, PFC, and cingulate gyrus, and their progressive decline. We examine three populations already scanned with MRI: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (566 AD, MCI, and normal elderly subjects), the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 517 AD, MCI, and control subjects; of whom 85 have our targeted serum measures), and the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network, composed of younger adults from families with autosomal dominant AD mutations (DIAN; ~400: ~20% with AD; ~50% mutation carriers). We will assess: 3/4 how candidate gene variants associated with AD and inflammation (see Approach) relate to a serum marker of inflammation (tumor necrosis factor alpha;TNFα), and to hippocampal volume. 3/4 how serum levels of growth factors and homocysteine relate to hippocampal, PFC, and cingulate volume. 3/4 how exercise levels affect hippocampal volume; how growth factors and TNFα modulate this relationship. 3/4 how baseline serum levels of growth factors, TNFα, and homocysteine, polymorphisms in related genes, and exercise together predict brain and cognitive changes over a 2-year follow-up period. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our project will have major impact on public health by discovering how three key processes (inflammation, brain growth factors, and exercise) relate to brain structure and brain decline over a 2-year period. Physical exercise boosts the ability of growth factors to promote regeneration in the hippocampus, which is important in memory; inflammation (which has many causes, including disease) decreases that ability. Our last 20 years of work revealed how Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and drug abuse involve hippocampal deficits and brain atrophy. Here we will evaluate in three large populations how growth factors, inflammation, and exercise work together to protect or harm the human brain - identifying promising directions for treatment, prevention, and a mechanistic understanding of diseases and disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction.","Growth factors, neuroinflammation, exercise, and brain

"Early detection of asymptomatic middle-age adults at risk for AD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a pressing public health need to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its earliest, asymptomatic, stages. This would immensely facilitate the conduct of targeted clinical trials, the development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents, and, ultimately, the curtailment of the looming epidemic that AD poses. Such an endeavor necessarily requires a multidisciplinary team of investigators with complementary areas of expertise. The goal of this Beeson Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award in Aging (K23) proposal is to provide the candidate with the experience, knowledge, and skillset necessary to carry out high quality, clinically- relevant, aging research so that he might effectively participate in and lead such a multidisciplinary group in the future. The proposal, therefore, comprises a unified set of research and training activities that are well-tuned to the candidate's transition from a K23 trainee to an independent investigator. The training plan seamlessly combines meetings with mentors, formal coursework, didactic activities, hands-on training, leadership training, and professional development. Specific training goals include: (1) cultivate a more nuanced understanding of aging and geriatric cognitive disorders, (2) receive dedicated training in neuroimaging methods, (3) develop advanced neuroimaging data analytic expertise, (4) receive ongoing training in the responsible conduct of research, and (5) obtain the career guidance needed for successful transition from the K23 to an independent research career, and maturation into a future leader in the neuroimaging of preclinical AD. In turn, the overall objectives of the research project are to use novel multi-modality machine learning techniques to specify the characteristic pattern of brain changes that is distinctive of persons in  Stage 3 preclinical AD (the stage hypothesized to impart the greatest risk of future progression to AD), and then determine whether asymptomatic, middle-aged adults who exhibit such brain changes are more likely to experience future cognitive decline. These objectives are directly relevant to the global effort to halt AD via early detection of cognitively-healthy persons at high  risk for progressing to AD. This is because current national guidelines for detecting risk for AD i asymptomatic persons call for extensive evaluations (e.g., nuclear imaging and lumbar puncture) that are expensive, not always well-tolerated by research volunteers and, more importantly, not widely available. In contrast, this project will rigorously assess brain changes i Stage 3 preclinical AD using routine, non-invasive, and broadly-deployable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of brain structure and blood flow. A specific deliverable of this project is the derivation of a single, quantitative, abnormality score that can be used-in combination with pertinent health information-for identifying, on an individual level, asymptomatic persons at heightened risk for AD. Such persons may then benefit from more extensive AD biomarker testing, closer monitoring, and treatment with disease-modifying drugs when such drugs become available. The project's success has material potential to significantly extend the public health reach of the proposed guidelines for defining preclinical AD. The three specific aims addressed in this project are: (1) specify the pattern of brain changes on MRI that is characteristic of Stage 3 preclinical AD, (2) prospectively assess the prognostic utility of an aggregate measure of midlife structural-functional MRI brain changes, and (3) preliminarily evaluate how individual differences related to cognitive reserve and genetic risk modify the association between early brain changes and future decline. Completion of the interrelated set of research and training activities proposed in this K23 will greatly foster the candidate's development into an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in conducting translational and multidisciplinary neuroimaging studies of preclinical AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To forestall the looming AD epidemic, there is need for highly sensitive yet easily deployable methods for identifying cognitively-healthy persons at high risk for AD. This project responds to this public health imperative by pursuing the development of an MRI aggregate measure that is grounded by established AD biomarkers, and is predictive of future cognitive decline in asymptomatic middle-aged adults.",Early detection of asymptomatic middle-age adults at risk for AD,8723051,K23AG045957,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years

"Computational neuroanatomy of aging and AD via pattern analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our previous work on computational neuroanatomy of aging, and investigates the use of advanced pattern analysis methods in early detection of imaging phenotypes of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). AD is a disease of rapidly increasing prevalence and clinical significance, in an aging population. Currently available diagnostic tests detect the disease at extremely late stages, perhaps more than a decade after it first begins to develop. A variety of imaging methods offers great promise for the detection of early signs of brain change, which can be indicative of future clinical progression to AD. However structural and functional imaging patterns characteristic of AD are subtle, spatially complex, evolving dynamically with age/time, and are overlaid on changes induced by normal aging. This raises the need for sophisticated methods for image analysis and pattern recognition. Towards this goal, Aim 3 integrates high-dimensional pattern analysis and recognition methods aiming to quantitatively describe imaging patterns that have diagnostic and predictive value. Since these patterns can be spatially complex and subtle, conventional image analysis methods can be challenged. We therefore build on the state of the art of machine learning and pattern recognition, focusing on the major challenge encountered in medical imaging: high dimensionality of imaging data relative to the available sample sizes. Optimal multi-parametric feature construction and dimensionality reduction methods are necessary to meet this challenge and are considered in Aim 2 along with multi-parametric classification and clustering methods. The foundation of the pattern analysis of the work in Aim 3 is also set in Aim 1, which deals with more ""low-level"" fundamental image analysis problem: registration, which is a process that places image data to a standardized coordinate system, thereby enabling statistical analysis of spatio-temporal imaging patterns across healthy and patient populations: an optimal mathematical representation of morphological data is developed via a group-wise registration process. We apply this method to structural, functional and amyloid deposition image data from two of the largest studies of normal aging (BLSA) and AD (ADNI).        Alzheimer's Disease poses a major medical and socioeconomic problem, which becomes increasingly prevalent as the population lives longer. This project develops and applies computer methods for multi-parametric analysis of MRI and PET scans, aiming to detect very early markers of the disease. As patterns of brain change are complex, subtle, and occur in tandem with normal changes brought by healthy aging, they are extremely difficult to detect at early stages, during which effective treatments are likely to exist in the near future. Advanced methods for pattern analysis and recognition have shown high promise in terms of measuring and detecting such early changes. This project will contribute such methods to the field. It will also apply them to two of the largest studies of normal aging and Alzheimer's disease: BLSA and ADNI.

"Imaging Genomics Based Brain Disease Prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage of Alzheimer Disease (AD), and the existing studies have suggested that the individuals with amnestic MCI tend to progress to probable AD at a rate of approximately 10% to 15% per year. Early prediction of MCI patients with high risk of conversion to AD is of great importance for timely therapy and possible delay of the disease. Recent advances in acquiring multi-dimensional and longitudinal brain imaging and genome-wide array data provide exciting new opportunities to study the influence of genetic variation on brain structure and function. Integrating such multi-dimensional and longitudinal imaging genomic data holds great promise for a system biology of the brain to better understand the complex neurobiological mechanism of conversion of MCI to AD. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these neuroimaging genomic data sets have presented critical computational challenges for achieving the full transformative potential from comprehensive joint analysis of these heterogeneous and longitudinal data sets. This project aims to address these emerging challenges for early prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion with four aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel sparse bi-multivariate learning model based system biology framework for analysis of genome-wide association results across a large number of the structural and functional phenotypes derived from neuroimaging scans of the whole brain. Our new methods are designed for bi-multivariate analysis of high-throughput genomic data and complex Quantitative Traits (QTs) related to MCI-to-AD conversion by utilizing the system biology knowledge. Aim 2 is to further extend the learning approaches in Aim 1 with the new structured sparse models to the multi-dimensional data integration methods to identify the heterogeneous biomarkers from multiscale interrelated imaging genomic data for outcome prediction. Meanwhile, we will utilize the joint multi-task learning scheme to identify the stable genetic and phenotypic biomarkers that are associated with cognitive functions decline and MCI-to-AD conversion simultaneously. Based on the studies in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 is focused on revealing the longitudinal biomarkers of the changes of MCI progression or cognitive impairment by a new structured low-rank multi-task regression model. These biomarkers can fully differentiate longitudinal profiles of relevant QTs and better capture genetic associations with QT changes over time. Aim 4 is to evaluate and validate our proposed machine learning and bioinformatics algorithms on both synthetic data and real imaging genomic data. The results of this project will be able to efficiently improve our understanding of the complex neurobiological mechanism underlying the MCI-to-AD conversion. The identified biomarkers will finally enhance the early and accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion such that the clinical treatment can be provided in time.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are at high risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identifying MCI individuals with high likelihood of conversion to AD is of great importance for timely therapy and possible delay of the disease. Existing research works mainly focus on the studies using single genetic or neuroimaging data source and seldom consider the longitudinal data profiles. To address these limitations, this project focuses on 1) the development of novel bioinformatics and machine learning models for solving the computational challenges of analyzing the emerging multi-dimensional and longitudinal imaging genomic data, and 2) identification of biomarkers with prediction power on MCI-to-AD conversion from the large and complex heterogeneous imaging genomic data with the comprehensive system biology knowledge guidance.            ",Imaging Genomics Based Brain Disease Prediction,8964932,R01AG049371,"['Algorithms ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Behavior ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cognition ', ' Data Sources ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' Genomics ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Scheme ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' data integration ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' advanced system ', ' multi-task ', ' multitask ', ' neuropsychological ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS ARLINGTON,R01,2015,416566,0.23188787772736377
"Novel Strategies for Blood-based Biomarkers for AD: Role of Genetic Variation in a Multivariate Framework ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Without any successful drug trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment and proven efficient therapies for AD, early detection of AD in asymptomatic or prodromal stages is critically important in order to increase chances of reducing irreversible brain damages, slowing down disease progression, and producing better results in any intervention trials. Several biomarkers from MRI, PET, CSF, and peripheral blood show their potential as diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic response biomarkers. Among them, blood-based biomarkers, especially proteomic analytes from peripheral blood have great potential as AD screening tools due to its minimal invasiveness and easy access of collection method and would have an extraordinary impact on research and eventually clinical care to facilitate the investigation of early intervention. During the last couple of years, many studies have been performed to investigate the direct relationship between a set of measured plasma (serum) proteomics analyte levels and a set of AD relevant phenotypes using various assay technologies. Due to several technical challenges related to sample collection, storage and assay, previous studies couldn't fully investigate the potential of plasma proteomics data, resulting in relatively weak replications. Beyond these technical issues, previous studies to date overlooked two very important factors: influence of genetic variations associated with each protein analyte and correlational structure of multi-analyte proteomic data. Recently we have shown that genetic variation substantially influences plasma proteomic analyte levels independent of disease status. Therefore, in assessing the diagnostic and prognostic significance of proteomic data, gene variants should be taken into account. Another potential reason of weak replication could be relative weak diagnostic power of individual analytes because the majority of investigation focused on the effect of each measured protein analyte level on a set of given phenotype. In many cases, multianalyte molecular biomarkers are correlated with one another and most of studies using plasma proteomics analytes did not consider correlational structure among analytes when assessing their diagnostic potential. Although the diagnostic power of individual analyte can be weak, multivariate approaches to identify a set of biologically meaningful ensembles of analytes may better elucidate diagnostic and prognostic power of plasma proteomic signature. In this proposed study, we will address these two knowledge gaps in assessing potential of plasma proteomic analytes through a multivariate approach by applying advanced analytic methods including multi-dimensional data reduction, gene pathway-enrichment analysis, imaging genetics, and supervised and unsupervised learning. Results of this project could have a transformative impact on identification and evaluation strategies of proteomic analytes as diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic response biomarkers and proposed advanced analytical strategies can be applied to fluid-based multi-analyte data for various neurodegenerative disorders in addition to AD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diagnostic and prognostic potential of plasma protein analytes for early detection of AD has not been fully investigated due to various factors including two very important, but overlooked factors: influence of genetic variations associated with protein analytes and correlational structure of multi-analyte proteomic data. The proposed study will investigate influence of genetic variations on the evaluation of the diagnostic and prognostic potential of plasma proteins while addressing the two important factors through a multivariate approach. This study will have a very high impact on development and evaluation strategies of molecular biomarkers for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.            ",Novel Strategies for Blood-based

"Maximizing Power in AD Clinical Trials via Multimodal Machine Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An emphasis in ongoing Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is identifying those biomarkers which best predict future cognitive decline at the various stages of disease progression. These biomarkers can then serve as early markers for diagnosis, and for selection of subjects into clinical trials. Recent results suggest that the identification of such discriminative biomarkers is possible by adapting machine learning methods for this problem: but studies have primarily used modalities in isolation so far. The sensitivity/specificity offered by these methods is unsatisfactory for more clinically relevant questions: which MCI patients will convert to AD? Answering such questions requires new methods that leverage all data sources (e.g., imaging modalities, CSF measures) in conjunction. This project focuses on how data from multiple biomarkers should be optimally aggregated to best predict future cognitive decline, and how these models can improve clinical trials for AD. Hypothesis: Significant improvements in sensitivity and specificity for discriminating AD, MCI, and healthy controls at the level of individual subjects are possible by making use of multiple modalities (together with longitudinal data) simultaneously. Further, these methods will significantly improve sample size estimates in clinical trials, and help derive customized outcomes for evaluating new treatment procedures. Specific Aims: (1) To develop new image-based machine learning algorithms that can take advantage of multiple modalities simultaneously within a unified framework. (2) To provide a software and extensively evaluate these methods on the ADNI and BLSA datasets, to assess the sensitivity/specificity attainable by truly multi-modal analysis methods. (3) To interface multi-modal classification methods with AD clinical trials: (a) by developing comprehensive sample size estimates needed to observe specific outcomes, and using these methods to derive customized outcomes for an ongoing R01-funded observational/prospective study here at the Wisconsin ADRC. Methods: We will develop new multi-modal machine learning methods that will optimally exploit all data sources simultaneously. Our models will also incorporate longitudinal data, and exploit interaction between modalities at different stages of the disease. This will be used to derive a Multi-Modal Disease Marker (MMDM) (Aim 1). The algorithms will be evaluated on large-scale well-characterized datasets and provided as software tools (Aim 2). We will use these models to improve AD clinical trials in two ways: by sample enrichment and customized outcomes that provide maximum statistical power to detect treatment effects (Aim 3). Significance: This project capitalizes on the Wisconsin ADRC's expertise in machine learning, statistical clinical trial design, imaging, and clinical diagnosis of AD and pre-AD conditions. This project will be the first to implement a multi-modal machine learning metric specifically designed to speed up clinical trials so that potential therapies can be evaluated and an effective treatment arrived at as quickly as possible. This project will develop novel methods and software systems for highly accurate and automated identification of patterns related to Alzheimer's disease. The techniques will take advantage of the aggregate information from an individual's brain images from multiple imaging modalities such as structural images (e.g., Magnetic Resonance) and functional images (e.g., Positron Emission Tomography), as well as cognitive and demographic information.

"Computational neuroanatomy of aging and AD via pattern analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our previous work on computational neuroanatomy of aging, and investigates the use of advanced pattern analysis methods in early detection of imaging phenotypes of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). AD is a disease of rapidly increasing prevalence and clinical significance, in an aging population. Currently available diagnostic tests detect the disease at extremely late stages, perhaps more than a decade after it first begins to develop. A variety of imaging methods offers great promise for the detection of early signs of brain change, which can be indicative of future clinical progression to AD. However structural and functional imaging patterns characteristic of AD are subtle, spatially complex, evolving dynamically with age/time, and are overlaid on changes induced by normal aging. This raises the need for sophisticated methods for image analysis and pattern recognition. Towards this goal, Aim 3 integrates high-dimensional pattern analysis and recognition methods aiming to quantitatively describe imaging patterns that have diagnostic and predictive value. Since these patterns can be spatially complex and subtle, conventional image analysis methods can be challenged. We therefore build on the state of the art of machine learning and pattern recognition, focusing on the major challenge encountered in medical imaging: high dimensionality of imaging data relative to the available sample sizes. Optimal multi-parametric feature construction and dimensionality reduction methods are necessary to meet this challenge and are considered in Aim 2 along with multi-parametric classification and clustering methods. The foundation of the pattern analysis of the work in Aim 3 is also set in Aim 1, which deals with more ""low-level"" fundamental image analysis problem: registration, which is a process that places image data to a standardized coordinate system, thereby enabling statistical analysis of spatio-temporal imaging patterns across healthy and patient populations: an optimal mathematical representation of morphological data is developed via a group-wise registration process. We apply this method to structural, functional and amyloid deposition image data from two of the largest studies of normal aging (BLSA) and AD (ADNI). Alzheimer's Disease poses a major medical and socioeconomic problem, which becomes increasingly prevalent as the population lives longer. This project develops and applies computer methods for multi-parametric analysis of MRI and PET scans, aiming to detect very early markers of the disease. As patterns of brain change are complex, subtle, and occur in tandem with normal changes brought by healthy aging, they are extremely difficult to detect at early stages, during which effective treatments are likely to exist in the near future. Advanced methods for pattern analysis and recognition have shown high promise in terms of measuring and detecting such early changes. This project will contribute such methods to the field. It will also apply them to two of the largest studies of normal aging and Alzheimer's disease: BLSA and ADNI.",Computational neuroanatomy of aging and AD via pattern analysis,8881034,R01AG014971,"['Age ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Amyloid deposition ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Neuroanatomies ', ' Neuranatomy ', ' Neuranatomies ', ' Neuroanatomy ', ' Noise ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Staging ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Structure ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' MRI Scans ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Predictive Value ', ' in vivo ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' markov model ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' normal aging ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' healthy aging ', ' patient population ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' computational anatomy ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2015,342584,0.17114552061331934
"A machine learning approach to identify Alzheimer's disease therapeutic targets     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate goal of this project is to enable the use of molecular profiles (e.g., expression data, genetic data, and proteomic data) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients to facilitate to identify therapeutic targets. There is a growing availabilit of expression profiles of brain tissues from AD patients and normal subjects, which holds great promise for improving our molecular-level understanding of AD and developing new drugs. The most important step necessary to realize this goal is to identify molecular features, such as expression levels of certain genes, in these data that are predictive of AD phenotypes indicative of the disease progression, such as neuropathological and clinical phenotypes. Despite the pressing need, due to the high-dimensionality of the expression data, it is an open challenge to identify molecular features that are truly associated with a phenotype. This is a critical barrier that impedes progress in identifying therapeutic targets from high-throughput molecular profiles. To resolve this challenge, this project proposes to identify network-based features representing important molecular events in disease progression from gene expression data, and use the identified features to predict AD-related phenotypes. This approach can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the expression data by focusing on a small subset of genes that are likely relevant to AD. In particular, we focus on the following network-features: perturbed genes that have different connectivity patterns with other genes between different AD stages (Aim 1); hubs that are densely connected with other genes in the inferred network in AD (Aim 2); and common hubs (co-hubs) between AD and cardiovascular disease (Aim 2). In each aim, we will develop powerful machine learning (ML) algorithms that can jointly model interactions of genes that are present in multiple heterogeneous datasets. We will apply the identified network-based features to predict neuropathological and clinical phenotypes in the data from a densely phenotyped cohort in the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study. The features selected to be predictive of these phenotypes will provide us with better insights into the molecular mechanisms driving AD progression, which can lead to effective therapeutic targets. Successful completion of the proposed research will lead to the discovery of the molecular features that are informative of the disease processes and can thus guide drug development. The proposed research will lay the groundwork of an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, a statistician, basic biologists, a internist and a neuropathologist to develop a systematic computational framework for identifying AD therapeutic targets from heterogeneous molecular and clinical profiles.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to improve our molecular-level understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and identify novel therapeutic targets. The growing availability of molecular profiles - such as DNA sequence, epigenetic data, RNA expression data and proteomic data - from AD brain tissues holds great promise to identify molecular features (e.g., expression levels of certain genes) that are informative of the disease processes and can thus guide drug development.

"Regional Neurotoxicity & Early Biomarkers of Air Pollution Effects on Brain Aging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects more women than men and burdens millions of aging Americans and their families. While our knowledge of modifiable risk factors for AD remains limited, there is growing evidence that exposure to ambient air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM) and ozone, accelerates brain aging. Built on our collaborative work on neurotoxic effects of ambient air pollution and cognitive aging in Women's Health Initiative Study (WHIMS), this application will address two critical knowledge gaps in this promising area of air pollution-neuroepidemiology: (1) It is unclear whether brain region- and/or site-specific neurotoxicity occurs from ambient air pollution exposure; and (2) Strong epidemiologic evidence linking ambient air pollution to increased AD risk are still lacking. These knowledge gaps reflect limitations of previous research with conventional analyses of neuroimaging data and insufficient power in linking AD risk with exposures. This application will overcome these challenges by combing three unique data sources (WHIMS air pollution exposure; WHIMS MRI; and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI]). Leveraging the longitudinal brain structure data from WHIMS MRI (gathered in 2005-6; 2010-2011) plus air pollution exposure estimates generated for WHIMS (gathered in 1993-2010), we will apply high-dimensional computational methods to conduct voxel-based analyses with a systematic and agnostic approach to examining the brain region-specific neurotoxicity of air pollution. This exploratory R21 application will also test the hypothesized adverse effect of ambient air pollution on the pattern of brain structure predictive of increased AD risk in an optimal population context, where ambient air pollutants affected the cognitive aging in older women. ADNI provides a well-characterized clinical database of cognitive normal and AD phenotypes, enabling our development/validation of novel AD risk metrics based on neuroimaging data applicable to WHIMS MRI. Thus, our Specific Aims are: Aim 1) Using structural brain MRI and air pollution data from the WHIMS-MRI cohort, to examine whether spatial patterns of grey matter/white matter atrophy at baseline and their changes over time are associated with air pollutant exposures; and Aim 2) Using novel metrics of AD risk to conduct a quantitative assessment linking AD risk with ambient air pollution. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team with complementary expertise in high-dimensional machining learning for neuroimaging data analyses, cognitive aging, and air pollution neurotoxicology/epidemiology. Our study will advance the field of environmental epidemiology of aging by using advanced analytical tools to link air pollution exposures to spatial patterns of brain structure and the predicted risk of AD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Long-term exposure to air pollutants may adversely impact the cognitive health of older individuals, however this link is not well-established and whether this conveys an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease is unknown. Leveraging brain magnetic resonance imaging data collected at geographically dispersed US sites and geocoded estimates of person-specific long-term environmental exposures, we will use sophisticated machine learning methods to characterize associations that exposure to air pollution has with brain structure and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Determining the nature and extent of these relationships, and their consistency across subgroups of older women, we will identify targets towards improving the health of seniors.                ",Regional Neurotoxicity & Early Biomarkers of Air Pollution Effects on Brain Aging,8960162,R21AG051113,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Air Pollution ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Amyloid ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' frontal cortex ', ' frontal lobe ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' Health ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Memory ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' Ozone ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' temporal lobe/cortex ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' tangle ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' morphometry ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Exposure to ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' Nature ', ' Combs ', ' Comb animal structure ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' brain tissue ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' neurotoxicology ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Reporting ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Validation ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' disease phenotype ', ' neuroinflammation ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' older women ', ' modifiable risk ', ' analytical tool ', ' neurotoxic ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' aging brain ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2015,249785,0.20343973838564
"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables. Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Novel whole-genome analysis methods for Alzheimer's risk prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) affects millions of elderly people in the United States, yet there are no well-established clinical guidelines for assessing a person's relative risk. Accurate assessment of lifetime risk for LOAD would give high-risk individuals the opportunity to undergo regular biomarker screening for signs of disease and to modify environmental risk factors or participate in prospective clinical trials. This Phase I SBIR project aims to develop a risk prediction model for LOAD that meets or exceeds the accuracy standards established in 1998 by the Working Group for Biochemical and Molecular Markers of Alzheimer's Disease. The recent release of whole-genome sequence data from an extensively phenotyped cohort of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative creates a unique opportunity to develop the methodology needed to successfully construct such a risk prediction model. The Parabon team will undertake three specific aims in pursuit of the final goal of producing a risk prediction model that can be used in the clinic. First, a novel methodology will be created for analyzing whole-genome sequence data to discover common SNPs, rare variants, and epistatic interactions that significantly associate with LOAD endophenotypes, the specific physiological changes that underlie disease. This will require innovative algorithm and software development, particularly the implementation of multi-objective optimization in our existing evolutionary search algorithm for detecting epistasis. Second, the discovered significant variants will be built into risk prediction models for each endophenotype using state-of-the-art machine learning methods. These models will then be combined into a single predictive model for lifetime risk, which will be validated in an independent cohort from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. Finally, to quantify the confidence associated with each prediction made by the model, algorithms and software for calculating confidence intervals will be developed and implemented. Each new prediction will be presented with a measure of confidence to enable clinicians to determine what, if any, intervention is necessary. When these aims have been completed, Parabon will have produced the first clinically relevant genetic risk prediction model for late-onset Alzheimer's Disease, as well as a suite of software that can be used in the development of other diagnostics.

"Quantifying Brain Abnormality by Multimodality Neuroimage Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops for an unknown and variable amount of time before its symptoms fully manifest. But, when the symptoms become clinically observable, a significant neurodegeneration has already taken place. Thus, there is a largely unmet need for technologies that can aid the effective early diagnosis and prognosis of AD in an in vivo and more objective manner. The goal of this renewal project is to develop a set of advanced machine-learning techniques for precise in vivo quantification of pathological changes of brains with multimodality neuroimaging for both early diagnosis and prognosis of AD. AD is a highly heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with complex pathophysiology, thus very challenging to pinpoint its subtle pathologies without any aid from advanced computational technologies. To this end, we propose the following four specific aims to identify those subtle disease-induced alterations, derive robust diagnostic conclusions, and predict future disease trajectories. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop a multi-view feature representation technique to robustly extract complementary information from neuroimaging data with multiple representative atlases, and then identify a small subset of most discriminative features for AD diagnosis. This novel multi-atlas technique will deviate from the conventional single-atlas approaches in feature representation, which are often susceptible to inter-subject structural variability, registration error, and atlas selection bias. In Aim 2, we will further devlop two novel multi-view feature mapping techniques for collaborative fusion of multimodality information by explicitly considering the distribution heterogeneity of different categories of features extracted from different modalities. This will significantly avoid the unnecessary complexity of feature distributions after our collaborative fusion, thus increasing the efficacy of subsequent diagnostic classifiers. Specifically, a deep learning technique (with deep multi-layered architecture) will be adopted to hierarchically mine multimodality information that resides nonlinearly both within each modality and between different modalities. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-task sparse learning technique for joint prediction of diagnostic status and clinical scores (e.g., ADAS-Cog and MMSE) by considering the inherent correlations between features and between training samples. This will also allow us to exploit the latent structure underlying the data for robust estimation of these highly variable clinical scores. Finally, in Aim 4, we will jointly predict clinical scores of each given subject in multiple future time points, by developing coupled random forests that can take advantage of all training subjects with complete or even incomplete multimodality data and further enforce temporal consistency of those estimated clinical scores.  All the above-proposed techniques will be evaluated by a large image set of elderly subjects in ADNI. We expect that the successful completion of this renewal project will result in a comprehensive and effective diagnosis/prognosis framework for improving early detection of AD. The respective software tools will be released freely to the research community, as we have done with our HAMMER software, which has been downloaded by >5200 users from >20 countries.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this renewal project is to develop a set of advanced machine-learning techniques for precise in vivo quantification of pathological changes, afforded by multimodality neuroimaging data, for both diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's diseases (AD).

"A Structural Brain MRI Dementia Forecast Tool ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is a devastating disease with no available treatment or prevention. The current lifetime risk for a 65-year-old individual is estimated to be around 10%. Given current projections, over 13.5 million individuals will be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease by 2050.  As the development of therapeutic strategies progresses through drug trials, the current view is that the optimal window of opportunity to benefit an individual is years before symptoms appear, in what is called the preclinical phase. Preclinical AD is thought to begin with the abnormal accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. In research and clinical trials, identifying individuals with these plaques is possible with PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures. Yet, with a cost of more than $5000 per scan, PiB-PET is an expensive means of screening, and involves exposure to ionizing radiation, a considerable health risk. A CSF test necessitates an invasive lumbar puncture with the accompanying risks of headaches, back pain, bleeding, infection and even potential brainstem herniation.  We propose to develop software tools that make use of structural MRI scan data to predict the amyloid status of cognitively normal individuals undergoing a screening process, and, for a set of individuals, identify those most at risk of progressing to AD. We believe a two-step MRI + PiB-PET screening procedure will yield significant cost savings by reducing the number of expensive PET scans, and might further help limit redundant radiation exposure due to unnecessary PET imaging in low-risk individuals. Lastly, the identification of individuals with amyloid accumulation who are at risk of imminent clinical decline will be invaluable for drug trial recruitment and future clinical management.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal is to build software tools that will predict amyloid status and forecast future clinical progression toward AD dementia. The tools, which examine measures derived from an MRI scan, will be invaluable for pre-screening, stratifying, and tracking individuals recruited for preclinical AD trials, and will offer substantial cost savings b reducing the number of PET scans necessary to identify amyloid-positive cognitively normal individuals.            ",A Structural Brain MRI Dementia Forecast

"Early detection of asymptomatic middle-age adults at risk for AD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a pressing public health need to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its earliest, asymptomatic, stages. This would immensely facilitate the conduct of targeted clinical trials, the development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents, and, ultimately, the curtailment of the looming epidemic that AD poses. Such an endeavor necessarily requires a multidisciplinary team of investigators with complementary areas of expertise. The goal of this Beeson Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award in Aging (K23) proposal is to provide the candidate with the experience, knowledge, and skillset necessary to carry out high quality, clinically- relevant, aging research so that he might effectively participate in and lead such a multidisciplinary group in the future. The proposal, therefore, comprises a unified set of research and training activities that are well-tuned to the candidate's transition from a K23 trainee to an independent investigator. The training plan seamlessly combines meetings with mentors, formal coursework, didactic activities, hands-on training, leadership training, and professional development. Specific training goals include: (1) cultivate a more nuanced understanding of aging and geriatric cognitive disorders, (2) receive dedicated training in neuroimaging methods, (3) develop advanced neuroimaging data analytic expertise, (4) receive ongoing training in the responsible conduct of research, and (5) obtain the career guidance needed for successful transition from the K23 to an independent research career, and maturation into a future leader in the neuroimaging of preclinical AD. In turn, the overall objectives of the research project are to use novel multi-modality machine learning techniques to specify the characteristic pattern of brain changes that is distinctive of persons in  Stage 3 preclinical AD (the stage hypothesized to impart the greatest risk of future progression to AD), and then determine whether asymptomatic, middle-aged adults who exhibit such brain changes are more likely to experience future cognitive decline. These objectives are directly relevant to the global effort to halt AD via early detection of cognitively-healthy persons at high  risk for progressing to AD. This is because current national guidelines for detecting risk for AD i asymptomatic persons call for extensive evaluations (e.g., nuclear imaging and lumbar puncture) that are expensive, not always well-tolerated by research volunteers and, more importantly, not widely available. In contrast, this project will rigorously assess brain changes i Stage 3 preclinical AD using routine, non-invasive, and broadly-deployable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of brain structure and blood flow. A specific deliverable of this project is the derivation of a single, quantitative, abnormality score that can be used-in combination with pertinent health information-for identifying, on an individual level, asymptomatic persons at heightened risk for AD. Such persons may then benefit from more extensive AD biomarker testing, closer monitoring, and treatment with disease-modifying drugs when such drugs become available. The project's success has material potential to significantly extend the public health reach of the proposed guidelines for defining preclinical AD. The three specific aims addressed in this project are: (1) specify the pattern of brain changes on MRI that is characteristic of Stage 3 preclinical AD, (2) prospectively assess the prognostic utility of an aggregate measure of midlife structural-functional MRI brain changes, and (3) preliminarily evaluate how individual differences related to cognitive reserve and genetic risk modify the association between early brain changes and future decline. Completion of the interrelated set of research and training activities proposed in this K23 will greatly foster the candidate's development into an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in conducting translational and multidisciplinary neuroimaging studies of preclinical AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To forestall the looming AD epidemic, there is need for highly sensitive yet easily deployable methods for identifying cognitively-healthy persons at high risk for AD. This project responds to this public health imperative by pursuing the development of an MRI aggregate measure that is grounded by established AD biomarkers, and is predictive of future cognitive decline in asymptomatic middle-aged adults.",Early detection of asymptomatic middle-age adults at risk for AD,8867116,K23AG045957,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years

"Manifold-valued statistical models for longitudinal morphometic analysis in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) Project Summary The ability to quantitatively characterize incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in its preclinical stage is a critical step for early interventions involving disease modifying therapy and for designing efficient clinical trials to test therapy efficacy. This project focuses on deriving statistical image analysis methods for identifying the relationship of morphometric changes in this early stage with direct indicators of AD pathology (such as amyloid deposition) and various risk factors such as family history in late midlife adults who are cognitively healthy. The proposed analysis will be conducted on the largest preclinical AD cohort assembled to date and help elucidate how clinical-cognitive-imaging AD phenotypes emerge in asymptomatic individuals at risk for AD. The core of our analyses is a set of algorithms that allow operating directly on powerful “manifold-valued” representations of morphometric change and consequently yield high sensitivity in picking up real but statistically weak multi-modal patterns of the disease process. Hypothesis: 1) Detecting precise associations between morphometric changes in preclinical AD subjects with amyloid burden and various risk factors is possible using new algorithms that work directly with representations of the Jacobians of the deformation fields derived from longitudinal imaging data. 2) Conducting such analyses on a large multi-site cohort of asymptomatic at-risk preclinical AD individuals with identified AD pathology will a) reveal important insights into early disease processes when dementia is 15+ years away, b) provide preclinical AD biomarkers and c) provide frameworks for predicting clinical endpoints at the level of individual subjects. Specific Aims: 1) To develop new algorithms for performing statistical analysis of manifold representations of morphometric changes concurrently with multiple covariates representing risk factors, AD pathology markers, and clinical/cognitive measures. 2) Conducting an end-to-end analysis of two independent preclinical AD cohorts to identify the relationship of morphometric changes with various predictors as well as test/retest validation across sites. 3) Analyzing the largest preclinical AD cohort to date for characterizing the relationship of the entire spectrum of predictors to clinical endpoints for late midlife individuals. 4) Providing industry- strength open-source software implementing the full suite of models, integrated with existing software toolboxes, for deployments on a workstation, a high throughput cluster or the cloud. Significance: This project will have a significant impact across three distinct areas of brain imaging research: 1) characterization of how clinical-cognitive-imaging AD phenotypes emerge in asymptomatic individuals in the earliest stages of AD, 2) rigorous algorithms for morphometric change analysis in neuroimaging and neuroscience, 3) open-source end-to-end implementations of the algorithms for use within the community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This project will develop novel statistical image analysis methods to characterize complex morphological brain changes in healthy individuals who are at risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and also have some evidence of AD related pathology. Studying and quantifying the evolution of early disease processes in late midlife adults (who are cognitively healthy) on the largest “preclinical” AD cohorts assembled to date will yield frameworks that tie such disease patterns to precise clinical endpoints, such as cognitive decline. These preclinical AD biomarkers have direct applications in a) design of clinical trials for new therapies and b) eventual translation to clinical practice.",Manifold-valued statistical models for longitudinal morphometic analysis in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD),9170619,R01EB022883,"['abstracting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Amyloid ', ' Be element ', ' Beryllium ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Amyloid deposition ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Evolution ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Industry ', ' Linear Models ', ' Methods ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathology ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Running ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' tau Proteins ', ' τ Proteins ', ' tau factor ', ' tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Procedures ', ' morphometry ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Staging ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' neurobehavioral symptom ', ' Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms ', ' Cognitive Symptoms ', ' Cognitive Manifestations ', ' Neurobehavioral Manifestations ', ' interest ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' cohort ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Adult Sons ', ' Adult Offspring ', ' Adult Daughters ', ' Adult Children ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' disease phenotype ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' direct application ', ' web interface ', ' open source ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer disease prevention ', ' Alzheimer prevention ', ' AD prevention ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2016,331530,0.38176329996098246
"Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Dynamic High-Order Brain Networks Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Dynamic High- Order Brain Networks Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with no known disease-modifying treatment. Current clinical diagnosis and monitoring of the disease are primarily based on subjective neuropsychological and neurobehavioral assessments, which are generally susceptible to large variability. Objective biomarkers that are sufficiently sensitive and specific for diagnosis and monitoring purposes are hence critically in need. Neuroimaging fits this need and provides objective measures and markers of preclinical disease states for aiding researchers and clinicians in developing new treatments and monitoring their effectiveness. Since AD- related neurological degeneration occurs long before the appearance of clinical symptomatology, additional diagnostic information during the prodromal phase of AD, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is of paramount importance for the success of treatment. The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning diagnostic framework based on resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) for accurate AD diagnosis at the individual level, so as to promote early detection for possible treatment and prophylaxis. Achieving this goal requires significant technical innovations to empower researchers the ability to detect sophisticated yet subtle alteration patterns in brain function. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts in accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will harness the temporal dynamics of functional connectivity to provide additional information for accurate identification of individuals who are at risk for AD. This is significantly different from most existing methods that assume temporal stationarity and are therefore unable to take advantage of temporally-evolving connectivity information for more fine-grained characterization of rapidly changing brain states. In Aim 2, we will extract high-order information from functional networks, beyond the commonly used region-pair correlation, for characterizing functional synchronization of the interactions of multiple pairs of regions. This overcomes the over-simplistic pairwise-interaction assumptions of existing methods, and thus allows greater capacity to model complex brain circuitry. In Aim 3, we will fuse information across imaging modalities to complement functional networks with both the white-matter structural networks (generated using diffusion MRI) and the morphological networks (generated using cortical thickness information from anatomical T1-weighted imaging). This will allow complementary information from different modalities to reinforce each other in improving diagnostic accuracy. Upon successful completion of this project, we expect that the resulting comprehensive, integrated, and effective diagnosis framework will be conducive to improving the success of early detection of MCI/AD, as well as other neurological disorders including schizophrenia, autism, and multiple sclerosis.  Narrative Description of Project AD-related neurological degeneration occurs long before the appearance of clinical symptomatology. Information provided by neuroimaging data, which is sensitive to pathology during the prodromal phase of AD, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is of paramount importance for the success of diagnosis and treatment. The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning diagnostic framework based on resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) for accurate AD diagnosis at the individual level, so as to promote early detection for possible treatment and prophylaxis.",Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Dynamic High-Order Brain Networks,9170149,R01EB022880,"['abstracting ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Amyloid ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Information Networks ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Pathology ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Estimation Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' empowered ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Modality ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Brain region ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Source Code ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' comparison group ', ' neglect ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' neuropsychological ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' personalized diagnostics ', ' precision diagnostics ', ' personalized diagnosis ', ' brain circuitry ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' symptomatology ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,380000,0.24898856873093292
"MRI, Genetics & Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application of the MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia compares which of 3 approaches for diagnosing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is best at accurately predicting incident clinical dementia. Of the two primary diagnostic methods currently used, psychometrically defined and clinical determined, application of criteria for psychometrically defined has been most variable. Further, a novel algorithmic method is emerging as an alternative unbiased approach. Using commonly applied clinical tools of cognitive performance and brain structure obtained from baseline and repeat administration of neuropsychological (NP) tests and magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) scans, this proposed project will first determine what profile of cross-sectional or longitudinal neuropsychological tests and threshold performance levels, combined with imaging markers is the most efficacious in predicting progression to dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Another set of analyses will test the algorithmic method. The diagnostic models that emerge from these two sets of analyses will then be compared to diagnoses of MCI using standard clinical criteria to determine which of the three methods best predicts incident dementia. The clinical diagnoses of MCI and dementia are available through a separately funded initiative. Also central to this grant proposal is the inclusion of external seasoned investigators, who will provid their expertise in definition and study of MCI and the factors influencing progression to disease. This effort aims to provide enhanced sensitivity in application of NP and MRI tools to detect subtle impairment at an earlier stage on the preclinical continuum and improved specificity in determining the MCI subtypes most highly associated with AD versus other types of dementia. Increased MCI diagnostic accuracy will enhance opportunity for more effective interventions, which have been largely disappointing to date, and could eventually leading to a delay in the onset or prevention of the clinical expression of AD. The MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia seeks to identify the most effective method and criteria for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that is best predictive of incident Alzheimer's disease. Current efforts to treat AD have been ineffective because intervention occurs too late in the insidious process. The potential public health relevance of this proposed project is increased accuracy of diagnosis at the preclinical stage, where treatment opportunities may prove to be more successful and prevention is most feasible.","MRI, Genetics & Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia",9087082,R01AG016495,"['Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' cerebral infarct ', ' Cerebral Infarction ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Vascular Dementia ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Health ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Judgment ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Reading ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Seasons ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Specialist ', ' Entorhinal Area ', ' entorhinal cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' brain volume ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' neuropsychological ', ' Framingham Heart Study ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' White Matter Hyperintensity ', ' cognitive performance ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' ']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2016,634478,0.23028800924888249
"Multi-Modality Image Data Fusion and Machine Learning Approaches for Personalized Diagnostics and Prognostics of MCI due to AD Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in the US. More than 5 million people in the US currently have AD and the direct health care cost is over $200 billion per year. Detection of early phase of AD, namely Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), can delay, prevent, and treat this serious disease. The project will develop a clinically-feasible system for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) diagnostics and prognostics, by integrating multi-modality imaging data such as MRI and PET as well as non-imaging data such as clinical assessments, biomarkers, demographics, and genetic information. This project involves three Aims. In Aim #1, we will develop the system by designing diagnostic and prognostic modeling using cross-sectionally incomplete multi-modality data by multitask learning. Our multitask-learning approach that will simultaneously model multiple related tasks by allowing effective knowledge and data sharing to jointly estimate the diagnostic/prognostic models for each patient cohort. In Aim #2, we will update diagnostic and prognostic model using longitudinally incomplete multi-modality data by transfer learning. We will integrate the model of an old domain (e.g., the diagnostic/prognostic model obtained at an earlier time point) and the data of a new domain (e.g., new data obtained at the a follow-up visit), in order to obtain an updated model with better accuracy. This can take care of incomplete longitudinal data due to patient drop-off, because it transfers the old- domain model not the data. In Aim #3 we will conduct validation for the proposed models using the MCI data collected by Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) for all phases of AD. The current project is novel in creating a first-of-its-kind clinically-feasible technology for personalized MCI diagnostics and prognostics as well as in using “multitask learning” and “transfer learning” machine learning methods for modeling cross-sectionally and longitudinally incomplete multi-modality data. It is innovative in using multitask learning to model incomplete cross-sectional data (e.g., baseline data) and using transfer learning to model the incomplete longitudinal data.

"Longitudinal Analysis for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in elderly people worldwide. Due to the fact that the longitudinal abnormality associated with AD can be detected in vivo, neuroimaging measures have been playing an increasingly important role in searching for biomarkers of AD that can be used for early diagnosis, progression monitoring, and therapy responses measurement. The goal of this project is to create a set of cutting-edge computational tools for identifying very early biomarkers of AD and alert AD progression via longitudinal image analysis. The key to achieve high sensitivity and specificity AD diagnosis of individuals is the stable longitudinal measurements. In light of this, the candidate will first develop a novel learning-based 4D (3D+t) landmark detector (Aim 1) to find the landmark locations at all time points simultaneously. The trajectories of landmark set form a compact 4D shape representation to achieve temporal consistency in registering longitudinal image sequence to the template (Aim 2). As a result, the consistency of low level features extracted from MR or PET images can be significantly improved. Since the subject-specific patterns of structural/functional changes, although more relevant to AD diagnosis of individuals, is very subtle compared to huge variation across subjects, the candidate will further develop a supervised deep neural network to learn the latent high-level spatial-temporal patterns by coupled stacked auto-encoder and temporal max pooling (Aim 2). The learned spatial-temporal morphological patterns consist of (1) cross- sectional features from MR and PET images, and (2) dynamic short/long term longitudinal patterns w.r.t. different number of historical time points. In a clinical setting, not all patients have a large and complete set of neuroimaging data, or an equal number of imaging scans. In order to eventually translate to clinic arena, a novel AD detector that uses a spatial-temporal hyper-graph learning framework (Aim 3) is proposed to not only provide high sensitivity and specificity in AD diagnosis but also solve the above difficulties. To evaluate the diagnostic value, we will apply our trained AD detector to ADNI dataset and patient data collected in UNC (Aim 3). Finally, we will package all our developed methods into a software package and release it freely to the neuroimaging community, to facilitate other AD-biomarker-exploration projects performed in other institutes. Project Narrative This proposal aims for the development of novel neuroimaging analysis methods for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using longitudinal image data. In particular, a set of automated algorithms will be created to aid the difficult task of analyzing subtle and complex morphological change patterns of Alzheimer's disease during the disease progression.

"Quantifying Brain Abnormality by Multimodality Neuroimage Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops for an unknown and variable amount of time before its symptoms fully manifest. But, when the symptoms become clinically observable, a significant neurodegeneration has already taken place. Thus, there is a largely unmet need for technologies that can aid the effective early diagnosis and prognosis of AD in an in vivo and more objective manner. The goal of this renewal project is to develop a set of advanced machine-learning techniques for precise in vivo quantification of pathological changes of brains with multimodality neuroimaging for both early diagnosis and prognosis of AD. AD is a highly heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with complex pathophysiology, thus very challenging to pinpoint its subtle pathologies without any aid from advanced computational technologies. To this end, we propose the following four specific aims to identify those subtle disease-induced alterations, derive robust diagnostic conclusions, and predict future disease trajectories. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop a multi-view feature representation technique to robustly extract complementary information from neuroimaging data with multiple representative atlases, and then identify a small subset of most discriminative features for AD diagnosis. This novel multi-atlas technique will deviate from the conventional single-atlas approaches in feature representation, which are often susceptible to inter-subject structural variability, registration error, and atlas selection bias. In Aim 2, we will further devlop two novel multi-view feature mapping techniques for collaborative fusion of multimodality information by explicitly considering the distribution heterogeneity of different categories of features extracted from different modalities. This will significantly avoid the unnecessary complexity of feature distributions after our collaborative fusion, thus increasing the efficacy of subsequent diagnostic classifiers. Specifically, a deep learning technique (with deep multi-layered architecture) will be adopted to hierarchically mine multimodality information that resides nonlinearly both within each modality and between different modalities. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-task sparse learning technique for joint prediction of diagnostic status and clinical scores (e.g., ADAS-Cog and MMSE) by considering the inherent correlations between features and between training samples. This will also allow us to exploit the latent structure underlying the data for robust estimation of these highly variable clinical scores. Finally, in Aim 4, we will jointly predict clinical scores of each given subject in multiple future time points, by developing coupled random forests that can take advantage of all training subjects with complete or even incomplete multimodality data and further enforce temporal consistency of those estimated clinical scores.  All the above-proposed techniques will be evaluated by a large image set of elderly subjects in ADNI. We expect that the successful completion of this renewal project will result in a comprehensive and effective diagnosis/prognosis framework for improving early detection of AD. The respective software tools will be released freely to the research community, as we have done with our HAMMER software, which has been downloaded by >5200 users from >20 countries.

"A machine learning approach to identify Alzheimer's disease therapeutic targets DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate goal of this project is to enable the use of molecular profiles (e.g., expression data, genetic data, and proteomic data) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients to facilitate to identify therapeutic targets. There is a growing availabilit of expression profiles of brain tissues from AD patients and normal subjects, which holds great promise for improving our molecular-level understanding of AD and developing new drugs. The most important step necessary to realize this goal is to identify molecular features, such as expression levels of certain genes, in these data that are predictive of AD phenotypes indicative of the disease progression, such as neuropathological and clinical phenotypes. Despite the pressing need, due to the high-dimensionality of the expression data, it is an open challenge to identify molecular features that are truly associated with a phenotype. This is a critical barrier that impedes progress in identifying therapeutic targets from high-throughput molecular profiles. To resolve this challenge, this project proposes to identify network-based features representing important molecular events in disease progression from gene expression data, and use the identified features to predict AD-related phenotypes. This approach can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the expression data by focusing on a small subset of genes that are likely relevant to AD. In particular, we focus on the following network-features: perturbed genes that have different connectivity patterns with other genes between different AD stages (Aim 1); hubs that are densely connected with other genes in the inferred network in AD (Aim 2); and common hubs (co-hubs) between AD and cardiovascular disease (Aim 2). In each aim, we will develop powerful machine learning (ML) algorithms that can jointly model interactions of genes that are present in multiple heterogeneous datasets. We will apply the identified network-based features to predict neuropathological and clinical phenotypes in the data from a densely phenotyped cohort in the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study. The features selected to be predictive of these phenotypes will provide us with better insights into the molecular mechanisms driving AD progression, which can lead to effective therapeutic targets. Successful completion of the proposed research will lead to the discovery of the molecular features that are informative of the disease processes and can thus guide drug development. The proposed research will lay the groundwork of an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, a statistician, basic biologists, a internist and a neuropathologist to develop a systematic computational framework for identifying AD therapeutic targets from heterogeneous molecular and clinical profiles. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to improve our molecular-level understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and identify novel therapeutic targets. The growing availability of molecular profiles - such as DNA sequence, epigenetic data, RNA expression data and proteomic data - from AD brain tissues holds great promise to identify molecular features (e.g., expression levels of certain genes) that are informative of the disease processes and can thus guide drug development.

In the next funding cycle we will add a new positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technique sensitive to fibrillar tau [F-18]THK5351 indexing neurofibrillary pathology. In the prior funding period we recruited 179 individuals from a registry of 1,545 people at risk for AD known as WRAP (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention). We found that [C-11]PIB amyloid burden is detectable in 20% of people with parental history of AD at a mean age of 60. Baseline amyloid is more extensive in the presence of higher CSF total tau levels, and 2-year increases in PiB amyloid are significantly predicted by higher baseline CSF tau. The hypothesis for this renewal is that tau- related neurofibrillar pathology begins early (in accord with the neuropathology literature) in people at AD risk and its strategic spatial burden explains changes in amyloid, neural function and cognitive decline. Aim 1: To test the premise that amyloid burden is necessary but not sufficient to evoke preclinical cognitive change. We will examine effects of longitudinal amyloid and tau change on episodic memory trajectories over time in 235 at risk individuals including all subjects we previously enrolled and follow them over 2 years with advanced multimodal imaging and CSF. Aim 2: To assess the effects of tau and amyloid imaging on MRI and CSF indicators of neural injury and function. Aim 3: To develop a multimodal disease marker to maximize efficiency of clinical trials in preclinical AD. Following our work in creating tools for efficient clinical trials in MCI, we will extend these concepts to the pre-MCI phase of disease utilizing deep learning architectures with tau, amyloid and structural imaging inputs. We will also examine change over time in tau, amyloid and cognition as outcomes. As any of these features considered singularly may be affected by age, and as amyloid and tau may be `necessary but not sufficient' by themselves, a derived multimodal marker may have eventual clinical utility in enriching prevention trials with those most likely to progress, and increasing power to detect change attributable to preclinical interventions. Significance: Relative tau and amyloid imaging profiles have not been empirically established in the presymptomatic time frame and this information is urgently needed to identify incipient disease. No comparable studies exist regarding the evolution of tau and amyloid signal in the critical late-middle-age time frame of preclinical AD. This ongoing project represents a unique opportunity to examine the earliest determinants of AD progression, when treatments may be most meaningful. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/ NARRATIVE Identifying the earliest neuropathological features of AD including tau and amyloid pathology will improve early detection and inform clinical trials in the presymptomatic time frame. This project will examine these features with advanced imaging methods in a cohort at risk for AD who are largely asymptomatic. An outgrowth of the project will be information about the rate of change in AD pathology which can help us plan clinical trials in this population using derived outcomes about the brain itself, thereby reducing the number of subjects needed in a trial and increasing sensitivity to detecting change.",The Longitudinal Course O\F Imaging Biomarkers in People At RISK of AD,9192264,R01AG021155,"['cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' amyloid imaging ', ' amyloid pathology ', ' Alzheimer disease prevention ', ' Alzheimer prevention ', ' AD prevention ', ' public health relevance ', ' longitudinal course ', ' arm ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' Prevention trial ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' rate of change ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Amyloid ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' brain blood flow ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Pathology ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' Amyloid beta-Protein ', ' soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' amyloid-b protein ', ' amyloid beta ', ' abeta ', ' a beta peptide ', ' Aβ ', ' Amyloid β-Protein ', ' Amyloid β-Peptide ', ' Amyloid Protein A4 ', ' Amyloid Beta-Peptide ', "" Amyloid Alzeheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein "", "" Alzheimer's amyloid "", "" Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein "", ' Alzheimer beta-Protein ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' tangle ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' tau Proteins ', ' τ Proteins ', ' tau factor ', ' tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' nerve injury ', ' neural injury ', ' Entorhinal Area ', ' entorhinal cortex ', ' Hippocampal Formation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Staging ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' tool ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Semantic memory ', ' interest ', ' Episodic memory ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology -

"Regional Neurotoxicity & Early Biomarkers of Air Pollution Effects on Brain Aging ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects more women than men and burdens millions of aging Americans and their families. While our knowledge of modifiable risk factors for AD remains limited, there is growing evidence that exposure to ambient air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM) and ozone, accelerates brain aging. Built on our collaborative work on neurotoxic effects of ambient air pollution and cognitive aging in Women's Health Initiative Study (WHIMS), this application will address two critical knowledge gaps in this promising area of air pollution-neuroepidemiology: (1) It is unclear whether brain region- and/or site-specific neurotoxicity occurs from ambient air pollution exposure; and (2) Strong epidemiologic evidence linking ambient air pollution to increased AD risk are still lacking. These knowledge gaps reflect limitations of previous research with conventional analyses of neuroimaging data and insufficient power in linking AD risk with exposures. This application will overcome these challenges by combing three unique data sources (WHIMS air pollution exposure; WHIMS MRI; and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI]). Leveraging the longitudinal brain structure data from WHIMS MRI (gathered in 2005-6; 2010-2011) plus air pollution exposure estimates generated for WHIMS (gathered in 1993-2010), we will apply high-dimensional computational methods to conduct voxel-based analyses with a systematic and agnostic approach to examining the brain region-specific neurotoxicity of air pollution. This exploratory R21 application will also test the hypothesized adverse effect of ambient air pollution on the pattern of brain structure predictive of increased AD risk in an optimal population context, where ambient air pollutants affected the cognitive aging in older women. ADNI provides a well-characterized clinical database of cognitive normal and AD phenotypes, enabling our development/validation of novel AD risk metrics based on neuroimaging data applicable to WHIMS MRI. Thus, our Specific Aims are: Aim 1) Using structural brain MRI and air pollution data from the WHIMS-MRI cohort, to examine whether spatial patterns of grey matter/white matter atrophy at baseline and their changes over time are associated with air pollutant exposures; and Aim 2) Using novel metrics of AD risk to conduct a quantitative assessment linking AD risk with ambient air pollution. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team with complementary expertise in high-dimensional machining learning for neuroimaging data analyses, cognitive aging, and air pollution neurotoxicology/epidemiology. Our study will advance the field of environmental epidemiology of aging by using advanced analytical tools to link air pollution exposures to spatial patterns of brain structure and the predicted risk of AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Long-term exposure to air pollutants may adversely impact the cognitive health of older individuals, however this link is not well-established and whether this conveys an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease is unknown. Leveraging brain magnetic resonance imaging data collected at geographically dispersed US sites and geocoded estimates of person-specific long-term environmental exposures, we will use sophisticated machine learning methods to characterize associations that exposure to air pollution has with brain structure and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Determining the nature and extent of these relationships, and their consistency across subgroups of older women, we will identify targets towards improving the health of seniors.",Regional Neurotoxicity & Early Biomarkers of Air Pollution Effects on Brain Aging,9130087,R21AG051113,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Air Pollution ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Amyloid ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' frontal cortex ', ' frontal lobe ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' Health ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Memory ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' Ozone ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' tangle ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' morphometry ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Exposure to ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' Nature ', ' Combs ', ' Comb animal structure ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' brain tissue ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' neurotoxicology ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Reporting ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Validation ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' disease phenotype ', ' neuroinflammatory ', ' neuroinflammation ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' older women ', ' modifiable risk ', ' analytical tool ', ' neurotoxic ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' aging brain ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NIA,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2016,197236,0.20343973838564
"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Successful development of small vessel disease (SVD) biomarkers will advance public health by changing the landscape of research, diagnosis, and treatment in vascular and AD dementias, which commonly have mixed pathologies. SVD biomarkers will specifically refine participant selection in clinical trials, improve diagnosis of the most common types of dementia, and advance target selection in studies of the prevention and treatment of dementia in older persons.",Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia.,9272127,UH2NS100599,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' infarct ', ' Infarction ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sclerosis ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy ', ' cerebrovascular amyloidosis ', ' Congophilic Angiopathy ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Collaborations ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' cohort ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Prevention ', ' neuropathology ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' White Matter Disease ', ' advanced dementia ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' sharing data ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Prevention trial ', ' cognitive ability ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' ']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH2,2016,1111944,0.07678172258705646
"A Proinflammatory Endophenotype to Predict NSAID Treatment Response Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials PROJECT SUMMARY It is our hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are heterogeneous conditions and, therefore, a paradigm shift is required to identify specific subpopulations for targeted interventions. This approach has generated significant success in other complex diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. A key opportunity in this context is the identification of those most likely to benefit from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs and other anti-inflammatory compounds. The relation between inflammation and the development of AD, MCI, and cognitive decline has received a great deal of attention with basic science and observational human studies demonstrating a protective effect against cognitive loss. Likewise, in our work, inflammation has been a key mechanism in the biological profile that is indicative of disease presence. Based on a wealth of literature (epidemiological, cross-sectional, pathobiological and animal model), multiple clinical trials have been conducted to determine the utility of NSAID compounds in treating or preventing AD (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study [ADCS] AD and MCI anti-inflammatory trials; Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial [ADAPT]); however, each of these studies failed to demonstrate therapeutic benefit, in fact some patients may have exhibited worsening cognitive performance with treatment. Our preliminary data suggests that particular subsets of patients in these trials did benefit from treatment and that our blood-based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify both positive and adverse responders within these trials. Here we propose to leverage three previously conducted clinical trials to test our hypothesis that our blood- based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify the subsets of patients who benefited from these previously conducted clinical trials. By conducting proteomic assays from existing biorepositories from the ADCS and ADAPT, we will address the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate the utility of the proinflammatory endophenotype as a means for patient selection into NSAID therapy for treating and preventing AD; Specific Aim 2. To determine if change in proinflammatory endophenotype scores over time is a biomarker of therapeutic response. By leveraging a highly innovative method and substantial existing resources, the current project addresses a significant need in the search for novel approaches AD therapeutics. The significance of the current project is the identification of a specific subset of patients who will experience clinically significant cognitive benefit from administration of NSAID medication. If successful, the current project will set the stage for a novel clinical trial that enrolls patients specifically based on baseline proinflammatory endophenotype scores for administration of NSAID therapy. In the long-term, this line of research is designed to build a person-centered (i.e. personalized) approach to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's diseases are a growing public health crisis impacting millions of elders world-wide with a health care cost greater than cancer and equivalent to cardiovascular disease. Current treatments only slow progression of the disease and new strategies are urgently needed. The relevance of the current project is the validation of a person-centered approach to treating Alzheimer's disease by identifying specific subgroups that are most likely to respond to targeted therapies. The outcomes of this project will fundamentally change the approach to the search for novel therapies for AD from the “one-size-fits-all” approach to the search for specific subgroups that can be treated with targeted medications.",A Proinflammatory Endophenotype to Predict NSAID Treatment Response Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials,9177291,R01AG051848,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly

"Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and Clinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Cohorts The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is a prospective, community-based 3-generational study that enrolled participants between ages 20-50 and has examined them every 2-4 years to collect extensive lifestyle, vascular, biomarker data; 9300 have GWAS. Embedded in this cohort are 1036 multigenerational families. Surveillance for AD dementia (and MCI) has been ongoing for over 4 decades. We have identified 1421 incident AD, 1767 MCI, enrolled 800+ in a brain donation program, obtained 7000+ 1.5T brain MRI, and repeated, detailed neuropsychological assessments. We have recently obtained extensive omics in ~6000 (gene expression, methylation, miRNA, metabolomics and proteomics) and genomics (50X whole genome sequences [WGS] in 4197 with pedigree-based imputation to 6554) through the NHLBI funded SABRe CVD (omics) and TOPMed (WGS) programs. We seek to leverage these rich resources (>$25 million). We propose these specific aims: AIM 1 is to examine and explain temporal trends in clinical AD dementia in the FHS cohorts. The age-specific incidence of dementia has declined over the past 4 decades among FHS participants (in press). However, the reasons for this decline remain unclear. We thus propose to continue tracking temporal trends in AD dementia and MCI through intensive surveillance, and verifying diagnoses at autopsy. We hypothesize that better education, treatment of some vascular factors and protective lifestyle changes (diet, activity, social engagement) may partially explain these trends. AIM 2 is to identify the patterns and predictors of preclinical AD within FHS families by obtaining (i) a novel circulating biomarker (plasma tau on 8000+ persons, using samples collected 5-15 years ago and repeat assay in 450) to supplement 1000+ biomarkers already available, and (ii) brain imaging with tau- and amyloid- PET, 3TMRI, including assessment of functional connectivity, tractography and blood flow, in 450 dementia- and stroke-free, FHS participants age 35-75 on whom we have (a) directly verified familial cognition and AD dementia status (both parents and all 4 grandparents were FHS participants), and also (b) have WGS and omics data. AIM 3 is to utilize the available WGS and extensive `omics' data for deep molecular phenotyping of AD. We will undertake conventional family-based WGS analyses of AD dementia and preclinical AD endophenotypes and novel high dimensional (co-expression, network, systems-based) analyses in collaboration with Drs. DeJager (PI of Accelerated Medicine Partnerships-AD, with omics data in 1200 brains), Witten (award-winning mathematician in applying graphical analysis to omics) and Levy (PI of SABRe-CVD at FHS). We will validate our findings in unrelated and multi-ethnic (Omni) FHS participants, through collaborations with other cohorts, and share all data through dbGaP and BioLINCC for analyses by others. We expect to identify new biologic pathways, drug targets and biomarkers for AD, especially those applicable to the preclinical stage of AD and those explaining promising trends in AD risk; such pathways should prove most useful for AD prevention. Whereas the total number of persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) is increasing as the population ages, we have 4 decades of Framingham data suggesting that the risk at any given age is declining. We plan to study the reasons for this hopeful trend in detail through continuing our surveillance for dementia and cognitive impairment, collecting cutting edge brain imaging (amyloid and tau-PET, volumes, connectivity and perfusion on MRI) in the dementia-free (preclinical AD), and using sophisticated analysis of very extensive genetic and omic data already collected on Framingham subjects. This could help us better understand AD trends and biology and identify new biomarkers and treatment targets.   ","Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and

"The Macrovascular and Microvascular Contributions to Alzheimer's Disease: MESA VASCAD Project Summary Improving vascular health for delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is identified as a critical goal by the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias Conference, the 2015 NIA AD Summit and PAR-15-356 (to which this application is responding). Yet, critical barriers exist to implementing vascular prevention strategies for AD, and elucidating the role of midlife metabolic, macro- and micro- vascular factors in AD is essential to addressing these barriers. Each type of factor may manifest different pathologies in the brain that contribute to dementia sub-types, making a new and sufficiently comprehensive clinical trial a costly and time-consuming undertaking. To address this essential gap, we propose to leverage the rich longitudinal cohort data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study with the addition of detailed cognitive testing and multimodal brain neuroimaging – the MESA VASCAD study. MESA participants at the Wake Forest site (46% African-American, 54% non-Hispanic Caucasian) have already undergone extensive metabolic and vascular phenotyping, repeated retinal imaging and a brief cognitive assessment in 2010-2012. The MESA VASCAD study will add clinical and cognitive assessments (Uniform Data Set and supplemental cognitive tests); neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid PET); and reanalysis of retinal images. We propose to enroll 540 MESA participants in 2 years and repeat assessments 3 years later to more fully characterize targeted, modifiable vascular risk factors for AD. Through our Specific Aims, we will (1) test the hypothesis that baseline macrovascular and microvascular biomarkers in middle-age predict both standard AD neuroimaging outcomes (e.g. hippocampal volume and amyloid deposition assessed with PET) and more novel cerebrovascular biomarkers (e.g. microinfarcts, lacunar infarcts, neurite density and cerebral microbleeds); (2) determine if changes in metabolic and vascular biomarkers over 15 years predict cognitive and AD biomarker trajectory; and (3) using high-dimensional machine learning approaches, determine common, differential and interactive metabolic and vascular risk factor profiles among racial and APOE genotype groups. This proposed ancillary study, approved by the MESA Steering Committee, is led by a New Investigator with an experienced, multi- disciplinary team of collaborators. The MESA study is an ideal cohort for interrogating the questions in this proposal: it has highly detailed longitudinal risk factor data collected over 15+ years in a diverse cohort, which we can leverage and augment with cerebrovascular biomarkers, AD biomarkers, and cognitive reassessments - thereby creating a comprehensive brain phenotype dataset for vascular and AD risk factors. These new data will enable us to examine the timing and impact of vascular biomarkers on dementia biomarkers and cognitive trajectories before a diagnosis of pre-clinical and clinical AD-related disorders, meeting a critical gap in information that will help guide the development of novel therapeutic or prevention strategies for various forms of AD-related dementias. Project Narrative Vascular and metabolic disorders are proposed as potent modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, and may provide key routes for therapeutic and preventive interventions. We propose to leverage the vast resources of the NIH-sponsored Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study to examine the potential contributions of macrovascular and microvascular subclinical disease to AD-related pathology. At the Wake Forest MESA site, we will add neuroimaging, repeated cognitive testing, and reprocessing of existing digital retinal scans with novel measures of retinal microvascular architecture.",The

"Multi-modal Prediction of Future Clinical Dementia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The process of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is thought to begin years before symptoms. This ""preclinical"" phase, characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation consistent with AD, holds the key to identifying causes and developing therapeutic strategies. In the absence of sensitive and specific behavioral/cognitive tests, quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests will be critical for stratified medicine in preclinical AD. This project will examine two high-dimensional data modalities, namely structural brain MRI scans and genome-wide SNP data, in order to derive tools to compute individual-level predictions about future dementia onset. AD imprints a unique atrophy signature on the brain discernable in structural MRI scans. Converging data suggest that AD-associated atrophy is detectable years before clinical symptoms. The machine learning (or pattern analysis) approach, which our laboratory has advocated in neuroimage analysis, offers highly sensitive and specific atrophy detectors. We hypothesize these tools will be invaluable for identifying preclinical AD subjects who are at increased risk of dementia onset. Late-onset AD (LOAD), which represents >95% of all AD cases, is up to 70% heritable. In addition to APOE4, the major genetic risk factor, recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a growing list of other common genetic variants associated with LOAD. The complexity of LOAD's genetic underpinnings suggests that sophisticated models that aggregate data across the genome might help us explain some of the variability in disease progression. Developing such models using state-of-the-art machine learning technology and leveraging already-collected large-scale datasets is one of our main aims in this proposal. The proposed project will build on the principal investigator's (Sabuncu) strong background in computational modeling and machine learning to conduct analyses using cutting-edge methods on large-scale data. We will use multi-modal data, including neuroimaging and GWAS data, to develop and validate models that predict future decline in preclinical LOAD. Our method of choice will be a novel Bayesian ML algorithm, specifically designed for longitudinal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternatives (constructed by discriminating cases and controls) for identifying ""amyloid positive"" individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a multi-level approach for discovery and validation and a multi-modal strategy to test our hypothesis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Thanks to recent technological advances we can now reliably detect Alzheimer's pathology in individuals during the preclinical phase, which can last years before symptoms begin. Yet we lack the tools to predict the course of these preclinical individuals, many of which progress to dementia quite quickly, while others remain asymptomatic. The proposed project will leverage large- scale datasets such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and sophisticated data mining techniques to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on multi-modal data, including genetic markers and MRI scans.        ",Multi-modal Prediction of Future Clinical Dementia,9033273,R21AG050122,"['Algorithms ', ' senile

"Early detection of asymptomatic middle-age adults at risk for AD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a pressing public health need to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its earliest, asymptomatic, stages. This would immensely facilitate the conduct of targeted clinical trials, the development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents, and, ultimately, the curtailment of the looming epidemic that AD poses. Such an endeavor necessarily requires a multidisciplinary team of investigators with complementary areas of expertise. The goal of this Beeson Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award in Aging (K23) proposal is to provide the candidate with the experience, knowledge, and skillset necessary to carry out high quality, clinically- relevant, aging research so that he might effectively participate in and lead such a multidisciplinary group in the future. The proposal, therefore, comprises a unified set of research and training activities that are well-tuned to the candidate's transition from a K23 trainee to an independent investigator. The training plan seamlessly combines meetings with mentors, formal coursework, didactic activities, hands-on training, leadership training, and professional development. Specific training goals include: (1) cultivate a more nuanced understanding of aging and geriatric cognitive disorders, (2) receive dedicated training in neuroimaging methods, (3) develop advanced neuroimaging data analytic expertise, (4) receive ongoing training in the responsible conduct of research, and (5) obtain the career guidance needed for successful transition from the K23 to an independent research career, and maturation into a future leader in the neuroimaging of preclinical AD. In turn, the overall objectives of the research project are to use novel multi-modality machine learning techniques to specify the characteristic pattern of brain changes that is distinctive of persons in  Stage 3 preclinical AD (the stage hypothesized to impart the greatest risk of future progression to AD), and then determine whether asymptomatic, middle-aged adults who exhibit such brain changes are more likely to experience future cognitive decline.

"Imaging Genomics Based Brain Disease Prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage of Alzheimer Disease (AD), and the existing studies have suggested that the individuals with amnestic MCI tend to progress to probable AD at a rate of approximately 10% to 15% per year. Early prediction of MCI patients with high risk of conversion to AD is of great importance for timely therapy and possible delay of the disease. Recent advances in acquiring multi-dimensional and longitudinal brain imaging and genome-wide array data provide exciting new opportunities to study the influence of genetic variation on brain structure and function. Integrating such multi-dimensional and longitudinal imaging genomic data holds great promise for a system biology of the brain to better understand the complex neurobiological mechanism of conversion of MCI to AD. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these neuroimaging genomic data sets have presented critical computational challenges for achieving the full transformative potential from comprehensive joint analysis of these heterogeneous and longitudinal data sets. This project aims to address these emerging challenges for early prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion with four aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel sparse bi-multivariate learning model based system biology framework for analysis of genome-wide association results across a large number of the structural and functional phenotypes derived from neuroimaging scans of the whole brain. Our new methods are designed for bi-multivariate analysis of high-throughput genomic data and complex Quantitative Traits (QTs) related to MCI-to-AD conversion by utilizing the system biology knowledge. Aim 2 is to further extend the learning approaches in Aim 1 with the new structured sparse models to the multi-dimensional data integration methods to identify the heterogeneous biomarkers from multiscale interrelated imaging genomic data for outcome prediction. Meanwhile, we will utilize the joint multi-task learning scheme to identify the stable genetic and phenotypic biomarkers that are associated with cognitive functions decline and MCI-to-AD conversion simultaneously. Based on the studies in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 is focused on revealing the longitudinal biomarkers of the changes of MCI progression or cognitive impairment by a new structured low-rank multi-task regression model. These biomarkers can fully differentiate longitudinal profiles of relevant QTs and better capture genetic associations with QT changes over time. Aim 4 is to evaluate and validate our proposed machine learning and bioinformatics algorithms on both synthetic data and real imaging genomic data. The results of this project will be able to efficiently improve our understanding of the complex neurobiological mechanism underlying the MCI-to-AD conversion. The identified biomarkers will finally enhance the early and accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion such that the clinical treatment can be provided in time. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are at high risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identifying MCI individuals with high likelihood of conversion to AD is of great importance for timely therapy and possible delay of the disease. Existing research works mainly focus on the studies using single genetic or neuroimaging data source and seldom consider the longitudinal data profiles. To address these limitations, this project focuses on 1) the development of novel bioinformatics and machine learning models for solving the computational challenges of analyzing the emerging multi-dimensional and longitudinal imaging genomic data, and 2) identification of biomarkers with prediction power on MCI-to-AD conversion from the large and complex heterogeneous imaging genomic data with the comprehensive system biology knowledge guidance.",Imaging Genomics Based Brain Disease Prediction,9131607,R01AG049371,"['Algorithms ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Behavior ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cognition ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Genes ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Health ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Time ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' Genomics ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Scheme ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' data integration ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' advanced system ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' neuropsychological ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' genetic predictors ', ' Genomic approach ', ' genomic strategy ', ' genomic effort ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' rate of change ', ' phenotypic biomarker ', ' phenotypic marker ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' biomarker identification ', ' marker identification ', ' genomic data ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS ARLINGTON,R01,2016,394966,0.23188787772736377
"Harnessing Diverse BioInformatic Approaches to Repurpose Drugs for Alzheimer's Disease The exploration of genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes derived from brains with Alzheimer's disease (AD) – including those provided by the Accelerating Medicines Partnership-AD (AMP-AD) – by powerful computational tools has the potential of developing new knowledge, including the identification of pathways and targets that may be involved in the initiation and/or progression of the disease. The challenge is validate the importance of those pathways – distinguishing primary disease drivers from secondary events – by finding drugs that impact those pathways. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to probe potential pathways in proof of concept, and ultimately therapeutic, clinical trials. Here, we propose to discover and validate hypotheses for drug repurposing in AD through three integrated, complementary informatics approaches. This bioinformatics campaign, parallel to a traditional drug campaign, uses AMP-AD data as the “laboratory” and electronic heath records(EHR) as our “clinical trial infrastructure”. Specifically, we will apply classical and network aware (prior-loaded) machine learning approaches (which have demonstrated utility in cancer-related omics datasets) to identify pathways and targets altered in AD brains at different stages of disease progression using AMP-AD data (Aim 1); and we will use systems pharmacology approaches to discover the target selectivity of lead compounds in human neuronal and glial cell types using unbiased RNA- seq, proteomic and imaging studies followed by pathway analysis (Aim 2). Aims 1 and 2 each has two approaches: data-driven, hypothesis-generating analyses to discern disease-relevant drug signals; and hypothesis-testing in which positive findings from one approach are evaluated using the other approaches to assess rigor and reproducibility. In Aim 3, we will develop new informatics strategies to conduct in silico drug trials to validate the clinical relevance of drugs by analyzing EHR, taking advantage of the UK 20 year CPRD longitudinal records of 15M people. A second independent EHR data set, the RPDR Database (based at Mass General Hospital) with 6 M individuals followed for over 20 years, will further validate hypotheses based on the omics data sets and extant literature. This coordinated informatics program compensates for the weaknesses of each individual informatics approach to promote discovery and critical evaluation of “lead compounds” for at least some AD pathways. To execute this strategy, we have assembled a team with expertise ranging from clinical care to computer science and systems pharmacology. Some of the team members are AD experts and others bring an outsider's perspective. Finally, as a deliverable, we will create open-source data packages to release all the supporting evidence, software, and data with provenance in accordance with FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible) standards through Synapse and the DataLens platform developed at MGH (Aim 4). These data packages will help to prioritize follow on clinical and translational studies including collaborations with industry or members of the larger biomedical community involved in new clinical trials. Project Narrative Repurposing existing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to accelerating proof-of-concept and ultimately therapeutic clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We propose a bioinformatics campaign, parallel to a traditional drug campaign, using available expression data from AD brains in the public domain as our “laboratory” and electronic heath records(EHR) as our “clinical trial infrastructure”. Resulting data packages from these analyses will be shared on Open Science platforms and will help to prioritize follow on clinical and translational studies, ultimately leading to new clinical

"A Proinflammatory Endophenotype to Predict NSAID Treatment Response Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials PROJECT SUMMARY It is our hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are heterogeneous conditions and, therefore, a paradigm shift is required to identify specific subpopulations for targeted interventions. This approach has generated significant success in other complex diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. A key opportunity in this context is the identification of those most likely to benefit from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs and other anti-inflammatory compounds. The relation between inflammation and the development of AD, MCI, and cognitive decline has received a great deal of attention with basic science and observational human studies demonstrating a protective effect against cognitive loss. Likewise, in our work, inflammation has been a key mechanism in the biological profile that is indicative of disease presence. Based on a wealth of literature (epidemiological, cross-sectional, pathobiological and animal model), multiple clinical trials have been conducted to determine the utility of NSAID compounds in treating or preventing AD (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study [ADCS] AD and MCI anti-inflammatory trials; Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial [ADAPT]); however, each of these studies failed to demonstrate therapeutic benefit, in fact some patients may have exhibited worsening cognitive performance with treatment. Our preliminary data suggests that particular subsets of patients in these trials did benefit from treatment and that our blood-based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify both positive and adverse responders within these trials. Here we propose to leverage three previously conducted clinical trials to test our hypothesis that our blood- based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify the subsets of patients who benefited from these previously conducted clinical trials. By conducting proteomic assays from existing biorepositories from the ADCS and ADAPT, we will address the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate the utility of the proinflammatory endophenotype as a means for patient selection into NSAID therapy for treating and preventing AD; Specific Aim 2. To determine if change in proinflammatory endophenotype scores over time is a biomarker of therapeutic response. By leveraging a highly innovative method and substantial existing resources, the current project addresses a significant need in the search for novel approaches AD therapeutics. The significance of the current project is the identification of a specific subset of patients who will experience clinically significant cognitive benefit from administration of NSAID medication. If successful, the current project will set the stage for a novel clinical trial that enrolls patients specifically based on baseline proinflammatory endophenotype scores for administration of NSAID therapy. In the long-term, this line of research is designed to build a person-centered (i.e. personalized) approach to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's diseases are a growing public health crisis impacting millions of elders world-wide with a health care cost greater than cancer and equivalent to cardiovascular disease. Current treatments only slow progression of the disease and new strategies are urgently needed. The relevance of the current project is the validation of a person-centered approach to treating Alzheimer's disease by identifying specific subgroups that are most likely to respond to targeted therapies. The outcomes of this project will fundamentally change the approach to the search for novel therapies for AD from the “one-size-fits-all” approach to the search for specific subgroups that can be treated with targeted medications.",A Proinflammatory Endophenotype to Predict NSAID Treatment Response Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials,9344521,R01AG051848,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly

"Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and Clinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Cohorts The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is a prospective, community-based 3-generational study that enrolled participants between ages 20-50 and has examined them every 2-4 years to collect extensive lifestyle, vascular, biomarker data; 9300 have GWAS. Embedded in this cohort are 1036 multigenerational families. Surveillance for AD dementia (and MCI) has been ongoing for over 4 decades. We have identified 1421 incident AD, 1767 MCI, enrolled 800+ in a brain donation program, obtained 7000+ 1.5T brain MRI, and repeated, detailed neuropsychological assessments. We have recently obtained extensive omics in ~6000 (gene expression, methylation, miRNA, metabolomics and proteomics) and genomics (50X whole genome sequences [WGS] in 4197 with pedigree-based imputation to 6554) through the NHLBI funded SABRe CVD (omics) and TOPMed (WGS) programs. We seek to leverage these rich resources (>$25 million). We propose these specific aims: AIM 1 is to examine and explain temporal trends in clinical AD dementia in the FHS cohorts. The age-specific incidence of dementia has declined over the past 4 decades among FHS participants (in press). However, the reasons for this decline remain unclear. We thus propose to continue tracking temporal trends in AD dementia and MCI through intensive surveillance, and verifying diagnoses at autopsy. We hypothesize that better education, treatment of some vascular factors and protective lifestyle changes (diet, activity, social engagement) may partially explain these trends. AIM 2 is to identify the patterns and predictors of preclinical AD within FHS families by obtaining (i) a novel circulating biomarker (plasma tau on 8000+ persons, using samples collected 5-15 years ago and repeat assay in 450) to supplement 1000+ biomarkers already available, and (ii) brain imaging with tau- and amyloid- PET, 3TMRI, including assessment of functional connectivity, tractography and blood flow, in 450 dementia- and stroke-free, FHS participants age 35-75 on whom we have (a) directly verified familial cognition and AD dementia status (both parents and all 4 grandparents were FHS participants), and also (b) have WGS and omics data. AIM 3 is to utilize the available WGS and extensive `omics' data for deep molecular phenotyping of AD. We will undertake conventional family-based WGS analyses of AD dementia and preclinical AD endophenotypes and novel high dimensional (co-expression, network, systems-based) analyses in collaboration with Drs. DeJager (PI of Accelerated Medicine Partnerships-AD, with omics data in 1200 brains), Witten (award-winning mathematician in applying graphical analysis to omics) and Levy (PI of SABRe-CVD at FHS). We will validate our findings in unrelated and multi-ethnic (Omni) FHS participants, through collaborations with other cohorts, and share all data through dbGaP and BioLINCC for analyses by others. We expect to identify new biologic pathways, drug targets and biomarkers for AD, especially those applicable to the preclinical stage of AD and those explaining promising trends in AD risk; such pathways should prove most useful for AD prevention. Whereas the total number of persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) is increasing as the population ages, we have 4 decades of Framingham data suggesting that the risk at any given age is declining. We plan to study the reasons for this hopeful trend in detail through continuing our surveillance for dementia and cognitive impairment, collecting cutting edge brain imaging (amyloid and tau-PET, volumes, connectivity and perfusion on MRI) in the dementia-free (preclinical AD), and using sophisticated analysis of very extensive genetic and omic data already collected on Framingham subjects. This could help us better understand AD trends and biology and identify new biomarkers and treatment targets.   ","Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and

"Predictive Analytics for Alzheimer's Disease Dementia PROJECT SUMMARY Increasing geriatric population and patients with multiple chronic conditions have exacerbated the crisis of a rapid increase in number of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. AD is the primary cause of dementia, and is responsible for over eleven million disability-adjusted life years (DALY) globally. Overwhelming evidence indicates that progression of AD is associated with increased dependency, resource utilization, and costs of care. The diagnosis of AD and onset of dementia not only places an emotional burden on patients, but the costs associated with Alzheimer’s care also places substantial financial burden on families, who often must make significant changes in their economic lifestyles to extend care. To mitigate the health, emotional, and financial burden associated with AD, we need to identify those at risk long before they develop symptoms of dementia. Early symptoms of dementia, such as memory impairment, may not be apparent during the current practice of primary care visits, unless directly assessed or adequately informed. Hence, it is not surprising that many studies reveal delayed and/or undocumented diagnosis of dementia among primary care providers. To address this critical unmet need, we propose to use machine learning and advanced predictive analytics and perform retrospective and prospective analysis of data, including clinical data from existing patient medical records, financial data from reimbursement claims, and demographic data from population health records to identify clinical, co-morbid, pharmaceutical, environmental, and other variables related to onset and progression of dementia. The overarching goal of the present study is to develop a comprehensive decision support tool that would predict cost drivers, outcome measures and trajectory of dementia onset in AD patients. To achieve our goals, we are working in collaboration with Chris Craver, Senior Director, Health Data Analytics at Vizient Inc., and Dr. Ronald Petersen, Director of Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at Mayo Clinic Rochester. We have now curated data from over 72,000 AD patients and 100,000 age-matched controls to date, and are now proposing to pursue studies with the following specific aims. Aim #1: Using descriptive analytics, create an interactive, secure, web-based interface to enable benchmarking of key metrics for AD and AD dementia, including population health metrics, co-morbidities and risk factors, therapeutic drug regimens, and the true costs of episodes of care. Aim #2: Develop an electronic health record (EHR) agnostic, HIPAA- compliant tool for predicting the development of AD-dementia, its disease trajectory and outcomes, medication utilization, total annual cost of care, and any diagnostics or therapeutics to augment adverse events. Successful completion of studies proposed in this application would enable physicians and care providers to better understand their AD patients with dementia. Additionally, product developed through this grant study would benefit key stakeholders in healthcare market place, including Medicare, Medicaid, commercial insurers, hospitals and health systems, in addition to AD patients and caregivers. NARRATIVE While Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and aging have several common pathogenic events and underlying risk factors, diagnosis of AD not only affects the patient but also places enormous emotional and financial burden on families and care providers. There remains an urgent need to reduce this burden by providing information, in advance, on the course of AD and costs associated with care. The work proposed in this application seek to address this problem by using advanced analytics and machine learning techniques, and identifying patients at risk of cognitive decline and dementia. By empowering physicians, care providers, insurers and health systems with relevant patient information, we will delineate trajectory of the disease, and help refine the current guidelines for dementia. Our rationale for such a comprehensive approach is that by augmenting clinical interventions and reducing inefficient resource consumption, we will advance value-based care.",Predictive Analytics for Alzheimer's Disease Dementia,9465969,R43AG058480,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Budgets ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Evolution ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' home health care ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' Medical Records ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Patient Care Episodes ', ' care episode ', ' falls ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Sickness Cost ', ' Disease Costs ', ' Cost of Illness ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' Memory impairment ', ' insight ', ' Disease Progression ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Collaborations ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Healthcare Market ', ' Health Care Markets ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' authority ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' HIPAA ', ' Structure ', ' health record ', ' Modality ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Early identification ', ' Emotional ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' response ', ' craver ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Provider ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Molecular ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' DALY ', ' disability-adjusted life years ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Consumption ', ' web based interface ', ' population health ', ' Regimen ', ' Secure ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergent care ', ' health data ', ' support tools ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Analytics ', ' predictive tools ', ' ']",NIA,"APRIHEALTH, INC.",R43,2017,144450,0.308976266943969
"Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Dynamic High-Order Brain Networks Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Dynamic High- Order Brain Networks Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with no known disease-modifying treatment. Current clinical diagnosis and monitoring of the disease are primarily based on subjective neuropsychological and neurobehavioral assessments, which are generally susceptible to large variability. Objective biomarkers that are sufficiently sensitive and specific for diagnosis and monitoring purposes are hence critically in need. Neuroimaging fits this need and provides objective measures and markers of preclinical disease states for aiding researchers and clinicians in developing new treatments and monitoring their effectiveness. Since AD- related neurological degeneration occurs long before the appearance of clinical symptomatology, additional diagnostic information during the prodromal phase of AD, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is of paramount importance for the success of treatment. The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning diagnostic framework based on resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) for accurate AD diagnosis at the individual level, so as to promote early detection for possible treatment and prophylaxis. Achieving this goal requires significant technical innovations to empower researchers the ability to detect sophisticated yet subtle alteration patterns in brain function. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts in accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will harness the temporal dynamics of functional connectivity to provide additional information for accurate identification of individuals who are at risk for AD. This is significantly different from most existing methods that assume temporal stationarity and are therefore unable to take advantage of temporally-evolving connectivity information for more fine-grained characterization of rapidly changing brain states. In Aim 2, we will extract high-order information from functional networks, beyond the commonly used region-pair correlation, for characterizing functional synchronization of the interactions of multiple pairs of regions. This overcomes the over-simplistic pairwise-interaction assumptions of existing methods, and thus allows greater capacity to model complex brain circuitry. In Aim 3, we will fuse information across imaging modalities to complement functional networks with both the white-matter structural networks (generated using diffusion MRI) and the morphological networks (generated using cortical thickness information from anatomical T1-weighted imaging). This will allow complementary information from different modalities to reinforce each other in improving diagnostic accuracy. Upon successful completion of this project, we expect that the resulting comprehensive, integrated, and effective diagnosis framework will be conducive to improving the success of early detection of MCI/AD, as well as other neurological disorders including schizophrenia, autism, and multiple sclerosis.

"CSF, MRI, and PET biomarkers of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorder. Inflammatory changes in the brain are thought to represent key processes in the onset and progression of AD, but it remains unclear whether neuroinflammation confers neuroprotection, accelerated degeneration, or possibly both. Such an understanding in living humans is critical if we are to begin clinical trials using the array of FDA-approved immunomodulatory drugs in the future. We propose that complement- mediated neuroinflammation is protective in the early AD stages, while suppression of complement activities is accompanied by the development of greater cognitive deficits and faster cognitive decline. Our preliminary data from multiple cohorts support this hypothesis by showing 1) reduced levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) complement-related markers occur in the dementia stage but not mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of AD; 2) reduced CSF complement-related markers and elevated CSF interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels are associated with faster decline in AD; and 3) CSF inflammatory protein alterations reveal networks of cellular and protein regulations. In the In the current application, we will build on the association between complement related proteins and rates of cognitive decline in AD to identify associated changes in soluble CSF cytokines and chemokines, differential inflammatory cell type regulation, and imaging correlates of neuroinflammation. This application takes advantage of our group’s strengths in performing CSF cytokine measurements, CSF immunophenotyping, molecular imaging of neuroinflammation through positron emission tomography (PET) and iron-enhanced MRI, and network analysis through a novel biochemical-bioinformatics pipeline. We will directly identify individual and networks of soluble CSF cytokines that accompany the transition from the MCI to the dementia stage of AD, correlate the complement and other altered pathways with microglial activation through two modern PET tracers (11C-PBR28 and 18F-FEPPA), and measure changes in individual T helper cell (type 1, 2, 17) and non-T cell populations. This application represents the first attempt to correlate, at the individual level and at the group level, CSF and imaging measures of neuroinflammation. If successful, this application will advance the understanding of neuroinflammation in AD through parallel approaches, form the basis of a new biomarker panel (and algorithm) to diagnose AD through a combination of degenerative and inflammatory markers, and accelerate the target identification of future therapeutics aimed at modulating the immune system in AD. Brain inflammation is a key event in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease, but it is not clear whether it is harmful, protective, or both. The current proposal aims to confirm our finding that a switch from the protective to harmful type of inflammation predicts more severe symptoms and faster progression in Alzheimer’s disease, and we can identify people with the protective and harmful inflammation by studying the cerebrospinal fluid (circulating proteins and cells) and brain imaging (PET and MRI scans).","CSF, MRI, and PET

"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia ABSTRACT The “preclinical” phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation in the absence of major symptoms, can last decades, and potentially holds the key to successful therapeutic strategies. Today there is an urgent need for quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests that can predict clinical progression at the individual level. This project will develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms that will mine high dimensional, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to derive models that yield individual-level clinical predictions in the context of dementia. The developed prognostic models will specifically utilize ubiquitous and affordable data types: structural brain MRI scans, saliva or blood-derived genome-wide sequence data, and demographic variables (age, education, and sex). Prior research has demonstrated that all these variables are strongly associated with clinical decline to dementia, however to date we have no model that can harvest all the predictive information embedded in these high dimensional data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to compute clinical predictions from high- dimensional biomedical data such as clinical scans. Yet, most prior ML methods were developed for applications where the ``prediction’’ task was about concurrent condition (e.g., discriminate cases and controls); and established risk factors (e.g., age), multiple modalities (e.g., genotype and images) and longitudinal data were not fully exploited. This application’s core innovation will be to develop rigorous, flexible, and practical ML methods that can fully exploit multi-modal, longitudinal, and high- dimensional biomedical data to compute prognostic clinical predictions. The proposed project will build on the PI’s strong background in computational modeling and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. We will employ an innovative Bayesian ML framework that offers the flexibility to handle and exploit real-life longitudinal and multi-modal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternative benchmarks for identifying preclinical individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a statistically rigorous approach for discovery, cross-validation, and benchmarking the developed tools. This project will yield freely distributed, documented, and validated software and models for predicting future clinical progression based on whole-genome, longitudinal structural MRI and demographic data. We believe the algorithms and software we develop will yield invaluable tools for stratifying preclinical AD subjects in drug trials, optimizing future therapies, and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. NARRATIVE Emerging technologies allow us to identify clinically healthy subjects harboring Alzheimer’s pathology. While many of these preclinical individuals progress to dementia, sometimes quite quickly, others remain asymptomatic for decades. The proposed project will develop sophisticated data mining algorithms to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on ubiquitous, easy- to-collect, and affordable data modalities: brain MRI scans, saliva or blood- derived whole-genome sequences, and clinical and demographic variables.","Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and

"The study partner requirement in preclinical Alzheimers disease trials Project Summary/Abstract Preclinical Alzheimer's disease clinical trials enroll cognitively normal participants who are willing to undergo disease biomarker testing, learn the results, and take an investigational drug (or placebo) if those results indicate that they are at increased risk for disease. Like traditional trials in Alzheimer's disease dementia, these trials require participants to enroll with a study partner, a person who can attend visits with the participant and report about any changes in the participant's cognitive or functional ability. Like traditional trials in Alzheimer's disease dementia, these trials face logistical challenges related to difficult recruitment. We recently showed that the requirement for a participant to learn their Alzheimer's disease biomarker status was not a barrier to successful recruitment. In contrast, the requirement of enrolling with a study partner was a significant barrier to participation for many potential enrollees. We also observed results that suggested that the study partner barrier was related to the requirement of biomarker testing and disclosure. This project will further investigate the study partner role in preclinical Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. First, we will explore the ethical implications of the study partner requirement, specifically whether this requirement is a barrier to enrollment because participants are unwilling to share their biomarker results with others. Second, we examine the scientific need for study partners, by measuring informants' accuracy and precision in assessing cognitive performance, predicting cognitive decline, and recognizing subtle changes in cognition, and comparing to participants' abilities to perform these roles themselves. These studies will provide valuable data toward improving preclinical AD trial protocol designs, assisting investigators making decisions around 1) whether to require study partners, 2) who is qualified to fill this role, and 3) how participants should be protected against potential stigma related to their eligibility. Project Narrative Preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials enroll persons who have no observable cognitive impairment who demonstrate AD biomarkers and often face slow recruitment. This proposal will provide researchers with critical evidence to instruct recruitment that will increase the representativeness of preclinical AD trial subjects and ensure a complete understanding of the ethical issues in these trials, preventing a degradation of trust between researchers and participants and ensuring the safety of those who enroll.",The study partner requirement in preclinical Alzheimers disease trials,9373717,R21AG056931,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Affect ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Amyloid ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Investigational New Drugs ', ' Investigational Drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Patients ', ' Placebos ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Trust ', ' Logistics ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Test Result ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Inferior ', ' Visit ', ' preference ', ' cooperative study ', ' Performance ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' data integrity ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' informant ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' eligible participant ', ' Alzheimer disease prevention ', ' Alzheimer prevention ', ' AD prevention ', "" Alzheimer's disease model "", ' AD model ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Prevention trial ', ' cognitive ability ', ' trial design ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' preclinical trial ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R21,2017,222493,0.18202421870690524
"Brain - Plasma Proteomics Biomarker Discovery and Validation in the US and UK There is an unmet need to develop novel biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that are minimally invasive and that more broadly serve as accurate indicators of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms in brain, including impaired neuronal and synaptic function, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Previous attempts to profile blood proteomes have been hindered by the relatively small number of proteins measured, difficulties linking their expression to AD brain and various disease processes, and poor replicability. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel plasma protein biomarker platform for AD by deeply profiling the proteomes of matched brain and plasma samples from the same cases, linking the protein networks to the extensive clinical, pathological, and molecular data available in the Accelerating Medicine Partnership for AD (AMP-AD) to nominate candidate plasma protein biomarkers and validate their performance in several independent cohorts. The research will extend and leverage our contributions to the AMP-AD consortium using discovery proteomics and systems biology to generate protein co-expression networks for human post- mortem AD brain. Our initial studies have revealed biologically meaningful groups of co-expressed proteins (i.e., modules) in cortex of AD cases that strongly correlate with key traits such as diagnosis, cognition and neuropathology. The modules identify proteins and pathways involved in AD pathophysiological processes (e.g., synaptic and cytoskeletal dysfunction, inflammation, apoptosis, and others), with stronger trait- associations than in RNA expression networks, high reproducibility across all AMP-AD cohorts, and progressive change from preclinical stages to advanced AD. In the proposed research, our collaborative teams of experts from Emory, Rush, and Oxford will first extend the discovery proteomic analyses in AMP-AD using next generation mass spectrometry and aptamer arrays, increasing the depth of protein coverage several-fold, measuring ~6000 proteins in brain (Aim 1) and plasma (Aim 2) from the same control, AD, and non-AD dementia cases in the Religious Orders Study and Memory Aging Project. An integrative analysis and machine learning will be used to nominate ~100 plasma protein candidate biomarkers most strongly associated with diagnosis, and key clinical, molecular and pathological endophenotypes. The performance of the candidate biomarkers will then be assessed using >2000 samples in three independent cohorts from the M²OVE-AD consortium, the European Medical Information Framework, and Dementia Platform United Kingdom (Aim 3), The results will amplify the impact of the AMP-AD and M²OVE-AD consortia with rapid and full data sharing, and establish an innovative pipeline for discovery and validation of plasma proteomics biomarkers that serve as robust and reproducible indicators of AD, including the dysregulated processes that occur in brain. There is an unmet need to develop novel blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the proposed research, we use new sensitive proteomic discovery methods and systems biology tools to identify the proteins altered in AD brain and plasma from the same cases in the Religious Orders Study and Memory Aging Project.

"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",9287487,R01LM012535,"['Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' epigenomics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' data integration ', ' Advanced Development ', ' Outcome ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' transcriptomics ', ' endophenotype ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' therapeutic target ', ' high risk ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' multimodality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Beds ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Indiana ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Phenotype ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Public Health ', ' Science ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neuro-degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' interest ', ' user friendly software ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Proteomics ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Genomics ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' ']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2017,367055,0.13973608789443465
"Quantifying Brain Abnormality by Multimodality Neuroimage Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops for an unknown and variable amount of time before its symptoms fully manifest. But, when the symptoms become clinically observable, a significant neurodegeneration has already taken place. Thus, there is a largely unmet need for technologies that can aid the effective early diagnosis and prognosis of AD in an in vivo and more objective manner. The goal of this renewal project is to develop a set of advanced machine-learning techniques for precise in vivo quantification of pathological changes of brains with multimodality neuroimaging for both early diagnosis and prognosis of AD. AD is a highly heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with complex pathophysiology, thus very challenging to pinpoint its subtle pathologies without any aid from advanced computational technologies. To this end, we propose the following four specific aims to identify those subtle disease-induced alterations, derive robust diagnostic conclusions, and predict future disease trajectories. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop a multi-view feature representation technique to robustly extract complementary information from neuroimaging data with multiple representative atlases, and then identify a small subset of most discriminative features for AD diagnosis. This novel multi-atlas technique will deviate from the conventional single-atlas approaches in feature representation, which are often susceptible to inter-subject structural variability, registration error, and atlas selection bias. In Aim 2, we will further devlop two novel multi-view feature mapping techniques for collaborative fusion of multimodality information by explicitly considering the distribution heterogeneity of different categories of features extracted from different modalities. This will significantly avoid the unnecessary complexity of feature distributions after our collaborative fusion, thus increasing the efficacy of subsequent diagnostic classifiers. Specifically, a deep learning technique (with deep multi-layered architecture) will be adopted to hierarchically mine multimodality information that resides nonlinearly both within each modality and between different modalities. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-task sparse learning technique for joint prediction of diagnostic status and clinical scores (e.g., ADAS-Cog and MMSE) by considering the inherent correlations between features and between training samples. This will also allow us to exploit the latent structure underlying the data for robust estimation of these highly variable clinical scores. Finally, in Aim 4, we will jointly predict clinical scores of each given subject in multiple future time points, by developing coupled random forests that can take advantage of all training subjects with complete or even incomplete multimodality data and further enforce temporal consistency of those estimated clinical scores.  All the above-proposed techniques will be evaluated by a large image set of elderly subjects in ADNI. We expect that the successful completion of this renewal project will result in a comprehensive and effective diagnosis/prognosis framework for improving early detection of AD. The respective software tools will be released freely to the research community, as we have done with our HAMMER software, which has been downloaded by >5200 users from >20 countries.

"Imaging Genomics Based Brain Disease Prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage of Alzheimer Disease (AD), and the existing studies have suggested that the individuals with amnestic MCI tend to progress to probable AD at a rate of approximately 10% to 15% per year. Early prediction of MCI patients with high risk of conversion to AD is of great importance for timely therapy and possible delay of the disease. Recent advances in acquiring multi-dimensional and longitudinal brain imaging and genome-wide array data provide exciting new opportunities to study the influence of genetic variation on brain structure and function. Integrating such multi-dimensional and longitudinal imaging genomic data holds great promise for a system biology of the brain to better understand the complex neurobiological mechanism of conversion of MCI to AD. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these neuroimaging genomic data sets have presented critical computational challenges for achieving the full transformative potential from comprehensive joint analysis of these heterogeneous and longitudinal data sets. This project aims to address these emerging challenges for early prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion with four aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel sparse bi-multivariate learning model based system biology framework for analysis of genome-wide association results across a large number of the structural and functional phenotypes derived from neuroimaging scans of the whole brain. Our new methods are designed for bi-multivariate analysis of high-throughput genomic data and complex Quantitative Traits (QTs) related to MCI-to-AD conversion by utilizing the system biology knowledge. Aim 2 is to further extend the learning approaches in Aim 1 with the new structured sparse models to the multi-dimensional data integration methods to identify the heterogeneous biomarkers from multiscale interrelated imaging genomic data for outcome prediction. Meanwhile, we will utilize the joint multi-task learning scheme to identify the stable genetic and phenotypic biomarkers that are associated with cognitive functions decline and MCI-to-AD conversion simultaneously. Based on the studies in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 is focused on revealing the longitudinal biomarkers of the changes of MCI progression or cognitive impairment by a new structured low-rank multi-task regression model. These biomarkers can fully differentiate longitudinal profiles of relevant QTs and better capture genetic associations with QT changes over time. Aim 4 is to evaluate and validate our proposed machine learning and bioinformatics algorithms on both synthetic data and real imaging genomic data. The results of this project will be able to efficiently improve our understanding of the complex neurobiological mechanism underlying the MCI-to-AD conversion. The identified biomarkers will finally enhance the early and accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion such that the clinical treatment can be provided in time.

Using the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 database and nutritional analyses of the traditional diets that correspond with the 26 populations, we will analyze whether specific nutrients correlate with the frequency of genetic variants that predispose risk of AD. We hypothesize that a population’s fitness would be enhanced and AD risk would be lower when the genetic variants that are selected for in a given population are in equilibrium with a diet that is enriched or depleted with the correlated nutrient(s). We will develop statistical models that will quantify these relationships. Aim 2: Translate nutritional patterns to a set of quantitative recommendations for AD prevention. With the nutrient data we obtain from Aim 1, combined with other evidence-based nutrition guidelines for AD, we will synthesize a set of qualitative and quantitative nutritional “rules” based on the app user’s genotypes, family history of AD and other health conditions. These genotype- and/or phenotype - specific rules will estimate ideal ranges for a given nutrient and amend the conventional “rules” (i.e. nutritional recommendations) by the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for America. Aim 3: Mobile app for delivery of personalized meal plan for the prevention of AD. This mobile application is designed for guided, proactive and self-executed prevention of AD, and targeted at those who are at elevated risk. We propose developing machine-learning algorithms to create meal plans that employ the modified nutrient ranges (from Aims 1 and 2) for a given AD risk genotype. Users will be able to modify food preference parameters (for example, “vegetarian”) while maintaining the appropriate nutrient ranges. A key outcome of this project will be a platform that supports population-wide dietary intervention by seamlessly connecting preventive healthcare with daily life in the digital age. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia in the US with over 5 million people suffering from this neurodegenerative disease. Aside from those actually suffering with Alzheimer’s, this devastating disease takes an enormous toll on families and caregivers and is estimated to cost over $200 billion in the US alone. The exact cause of Alzheimer’s disease is still being studied but there is a significant genetic component, with APOE alleles most strongly predictive. Nonetheless, diet and lifestyle interventions have been shown to mitigate Alzheimer’s risk even in those with APOE risk allele(s). Alzheimer’s pathology begins decades before symptoms appear and therefore making dietary and lifestyle changes earlier in life would be a cost-effective means of preventing disease later in life. This proposal aims to develop a low-cost, evidence-based, mobile app that delivers personalized nutritional recommendations in the form of meal plans to those with genetic susceptibility to Alzheimer’s disease.",Mobile Application to Deliver Personalized Nutrition for the Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease,9518200,R43AG055203,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Americas ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Food Preferences ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Mission ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' mortality ', ' nutrition ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Translating ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physical activity ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family history of ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' fighting ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neuro-degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Nutrient ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Dietary intake ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' fitness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Prevention Guidelines ', ' Population ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' Alzheimer disease prevention ', ' Alzheimer prevention ', ' AD prevention ', ' evidence base ', ' nutritional genomics ', ' nutrigenomics ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Preventive healthcare ', ' Preventive health care ', ' Preventative healthcare ', ' Preventative health care ', ' Android ', ' ']",NIA,GENBEN LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION,R43,2017,124438,0.2866321330316912
"Molecular Networks Underlying Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Among APOE E4 Carriers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The e4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene has been identified as one of the strongest genetic determinants of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In general, the e4 allele is associated with reductions in neural protection and repair, increasing a carrier’s vulnerability to damage accumulated over his/her lifetime. Nevertheless, while the penetrance of ApoE e4 is relatively high, a significant proportion of e4 carriers will never develop AD. The overall goal of this project is to model interactions across multiple omics networks to identify the biological pathways involved in sporadic AD susceptibility versus resilience among high-risk individuals. The multifactorial nature of AD suggests that it may manifest as a result of complex interactions across the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome. Identifying the central networks involved in AD pathogenesis will require integrative Systems Biology approaches. The proposed research offers a new and innovative way to integrate networks—a dominant feature in biology—across multiple tissues and omics platforms, in order to identify innate and dynamic precursors of resilience to AD, among a high-risk population (e4+). Towards this goal, we will: (1) employ newly developed GWAS-based network analysis, to identify SNP networks that alter the association between ApoE e4 and cognitive decline/dementia; (2) generate DNA methylation and RNA-seq data from brain samples that we will analyze using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (3) generate proteomic data from brain and CSF samples that we will analyze using WGCNA to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (4) use advanced integromic network analysis to identify multi-omics and multi-tissue pathways and biological systems involved in AD resilience. The integration of multiple 'omics' data using systems biology will be crucial for unraveling the connections and interactions between various functional levels involved in complex diseases, such as AD. Overall, our proposed research will improve understanding of the complex biology underlying AD susceptibility. These studies have the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets that could inform the development of future pharmacologic interventions aimed at preventing or slowing AD pathogenesis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individuals with the ApoE e4 genotype have a substantially increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The goal of this project is identify underlying biological interactions and networks that explain why some e4 carriers do not develop Alzheimer's disease, despite being high-risk. This research has the potential to uncover novel targets that can lead to the development of effective therapies for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",Molecular Networks Underlying Resilience to

"MIRIAD - Multiplexed Imaging of Resilience In Alzheimers Disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a leading cause of disability and death in the US and major global public health problem due to rise in aging population resulting in untold suffering, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies is certain. Solutions will come only from innovative research. Our application is highly responsive to this urgent scientific need by proposing to leverage an innovative molecular imaging platform invented at Stanford, multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI). We will determine the high dimensional cellular and subcellular protein-level expression, interaction, and localization for AD-relevant molecules identified by genomic and proteomic studies in resilience and pathologic states using human brain sections from an ongoing proteomic investigation of AD. We hypothesize that in-depth, stage-specific phenotypic signatures extracted from these unique groups will provide insight into the modifiable factors that endorse the protective mechanisms of brain reserve. We will test our hypothesis through three Specific Aims: (1) Establish a subcellular, phenotypic framework of vulnerable and resistant brain areas. Next-generation MIBI equipment will be used to rigorously image 30+ proteins simultaneously; targets marking subtypes of neurons, synapses, non-neuronal cells, neuro-inflammatory, and vascular components will be concurrently measured. (2) Reveal cognitive resilience multiplexed phenotypes. Using approaches we have successfully applied in other single cell studies, we will analyze multiplexed imaging data with statistical deep learning methods already established in our lab to identify topological, cellular, and molecular phenotypic differences among resilient, co- morbid, and AD dementia. (3) Implement a shared data repository. The power of multiplexed imaging in biology is its ability to reveal co-localization or mutual exclusivity to infer regulatory roles and gain mechanistic insight. To disseminate hundreds of these images from our proposed highly multiplexed study, we will create a web-based portal, using already established infrastructure, where all of the images from this study can be accessed, multi-color overlays generated ad hoc, and all the features will be shared freely. PROJECT NARRATIVE AD is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the aging American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. Such signatures will provide insight into the modifiable factors that endorse the protective mechanisms of brain reserve. Such insights will illuminate pathways that hold potential for new therapeutic targets, as well as create a shared research resource and analysis platform for the community of scientists committed to developing solutions for AD.",MIRIAD - Multiplexed Imaging of Resilience In Alzheimers Disease,9439172,R01AG057915,"['soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' amyloid-b protein

"Multi-modal Prediction of Future Clinical Dementia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The process of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is thought to begin years before symptoms. This ""preclinical"" phase, characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation consistent with AD, holds the key to identifying causes and developing therapeutic strategies. In the absence of sensitive and specific behavioral/cognitive tests, quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests will be critical for stratified medicine in preclinical AD. This project will examine two high-dimensional data modalities, namely structural brain MRI scans and genome-wide SNP data, in order to derive tools to compute individual-level predictions about future dementia onset. AD imprints a unique atrophy signature on the brain discernable in structural MRI scans. Converging data suggest that AD-associated atrophy is detectable years before clinical symptoms. The machine learning (or pattern analysis) approach, which our laboratory has advocated in neuroimage analysis, offers highly sensitive and specific atrophy detectors. We hypothesize these tools will be invaluable for identifying preclinical AD subjects who are at increased risk of dementia onset. Late-onset AD (LOAD), which represents >95% of all AD cases, is up to 70% heritable. In addition to APOE4, the major genetic risk factor, recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a growing list of other common genetic variants associated with LOAD. The complexity of LOAD's genetic underpinnings suggests that sophisticated models that aggregate data across the genome might help us explain some of the variability in disease progression. Developing such models using state-of-the-art machine learning technology and leveraging already-collected large-scale datasets is one of our main aims in this proposal. The proposed project will build on the principal investigator's (Sabuncu) strong background in computational modeling and machine learning to conduct analyses using cutting-edge methods on large-scale data. We will use multi-modal data, including neuroimaging and GWAS data, to develop and validate models that predict future decline in preclinical LOAD. Our method of choice will be a novel Bayesian ML algorithm, specifically designed for longitudinal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternatives (constructed by discriminating cases and controls) for identifying ""amyloid positive"" individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a multi-level approach for discovery and validation and a multi-modal strategy to test our hypothesis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Thanks to recent technological advances we can now reliably detect Alzheimer's pathology in individuals during the preclinical phase, which can last years before symptoms begin. Yet we lack the tools to predict the course of these preclinical individuals, many of which progress to dementia quite quickly, while others remain asymptomatic. The proposed project will leverage large- scale datasets such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and sophisticated data mining techniques to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on multi-modal data, including genetic markers and MRI scans.",Multi-modal Prediction of Future Clinical Dementia,9266742,R21AG050122,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ',

"Using connectomics to characterize risk for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION The prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years. While research efforts continue to focus on the causes of AD and to develop effective medical treatments, there is also a pressing need to characterize risk for AD before the disease is diagnosed. There may be subtle changes in brain and cognitive function that are detectable before major symptoms emerge. One approach for characterizing these vulnerabilities is the use of functional and structural neuroimaging to identify risk profiles for AD. The present study proposes and tests a model of AD pathology using neuroimaging network analysis and machine learning approaches to provide insight on widespread changes in information processing in the AD brain. The proposed model hypothesizes that some aspects of network information processing reflect neurodegeneration and cognitive decline associated with AD pathology (e.g., hub connectivity and global connectivity) whereas other network properties reflect attempts to compensate for compromised information processing (e.g., diffusion of information). In addition, this proposal compares the efficacy of models with respect to discriminating diagnostic categories (e.g., machine learning classification of AD and clinically normal subjects) versus isolating underlying dimensions of AD cognitive decline (e.g., machine learning prediction of memory and language scores from network features). Finally, this study will determine whether features of AD pathology are present in an at-risk sample of subjects; namely, individuals diagnosed with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). This will be examined by transferring the AD network models to aMCI subjects and testing whether the model can discriminate aMCI from clinically normal matched controls and whether the model can predict scores on cognitive tests. The analytic approach will using resting state fMRI data as a primary assay of network integrity, but diffusion imaging and task fMRI data will also be examined in an exploratory aim. The general approach will recruit individuals with AD, aMCI and clinically normal matched controls for each diagnostic group. The groups that are compared directly will be matched for amyloid status, as indicated by florbetapir PET imaging. The novel contributions of this project include (a) testing a network model of AD pathology that unifies various measures of network functioning, (b) comparing efficacy of modeling with respect to delineating diagnostic categories versus capturing underlying cognitive dimensions of AD, and (c) transferring the AD model to an at-risk group to assess disease vulnerability. This latter innovation can be applied in future studies to any group of subjects that is defined at risk, such as those with genetic vulnerability or positive family history. The present study also sets the stage for a subsequent longitudinal follow-up study to validate whether individuals identified at risk using network modeling actually convert to AD. Ultimately, network modeling of this sort may be used as a relatively less expensive and less invasive biomarker than PET imaging, which could lead to earlier treatments and interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE With the prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years, there is a pressing need to characterize risk for AD before the disease is diagnosed. The present study will use neuroimaging to examine brain connectivity and determine whether some aspects of altered connectivity are present in individuals who are at risk for AD: individuals who have mild cognitive impairment. This approach could be used in the future to possibly detect risk for AD before any cognitive symptoms emerge, thereby enabling earlier treatment and intervention to combat the devastating cognitive, social and financial consequences of AD.",Using connectomics to characterize risk for Alzheimer's Disease,9245134,R01AG055132,"['Affect ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary

"Manifold-valued statistical models for longitudinal morphometic analysis in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) Project Summary The ability to quantitatively characterize incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in its preclinical stage is a critical step for early interventions involving disease modifying therapy and for designing efficient clinical trials to test therapy efficacy. This project focuses on deriving statistical image analysis methods for identifying the relationship of morphometric changes in this early stage with direct indicators of AD pathology (such as amyloid deposition) and various risk factors such as family history in late midlife adults who are cognitively healthy. The proposed analysis will be conducted on the largest preclinical AD cohort assembled to date and help elucidate how clinical-cognitive-imaging AD phenotypes emerge in asymptomatic individuals at risk for AD. The core of our analyses is a set of algorithms that allow operating directly on powerful “manifold-valued” representations of morphometric change and consequently yield high sensitivity in picking up real but statistically weak multi-modal patterns of the disease process. Hypothesis: 1) Detecting precise associations between morphometric changes in preclinical AD subjects with amyloid burden and various risk factors is possible using new algorithms that work directly with representations of the Jacobians of the deformation fields derived from longitudinal imaging data. 2) Conducting such analyses on a large multi-site cohort of asymptomatic at-risk preclinical AD individuals with identified AD pathology will a) reveal important insights into early disease processes when dementia is 15+ years away, b) provide preclinical AD biomarkers and c) provide frameworks for predicting clinical endpoints at the level of individual subjects. Specific Aims: 1) To develop new algorithms for performing statistical analysis of manifold representations of morphometric changes concurrently with multiple covariates representing risk factors, AD pathology markers, and clinical/cognitive measures. 2) Conducting an end-to-end analysis of two independent preclinical AD cohorts to identify the relationship of morphometric changes with various predictors as well as test/retest validation across sites. 3) Analyzing the largest preclinical AD cohort to date for characterizing the relationship of the entire spectrum of predictors to clinical endpoints for late midlife individuals. 4) Providing industry- strength open-source software implementing the full suite of models, integrated with existing software toolboxes, for deployments on a workstation, a high throughput cluster or the cloud. Significance: This project will have a significant impact across three distinct areas of brain imaging research: 1) characterization of how clinical-cognitive-imaging AD phenotypes emerge in asymptomatic individuals in the earliest stages of AD, 2) rigorous algorithms for morphometric change analysis in neuroimaging and neuroscience, 3) open-source end-to-end implementations of the algorithms for use within the community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This project will develop novel statistical image analysis methods to characterize complex morphological brain changes in healthy individuals who are at risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and also have some evidence of AD related pathology. Studying and quantifying the evolution of early disease processes in late midlife adults (who are cognitively healthy) on the largest “preclinical” AD cohorts assembled to date will yield frameworks that tie such disease patterns to precise clinical endpoints, such as cognitive decline. These preclinical AD biomarkers have direct applications in a) design of clinical trials for new therapies and b) eventual translation to clinical practice.",Manifold-valued statistical models for

"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Successful development of small vessel disease (SVD) biomarkers will advance public health by changing the landscape of research, diagnosis, and treatment in vascular and AD dementias, which commonly have mixed pathologies. SVD biomarkers will specifically refine participant selection in clinical trials, improve diagnosis of the most common types of dementia, and advance target selection in studies of the prevention and treatment of dementia in older persons.",Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia.,9356352,UH2NS100599,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sclerosis ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' cerebrovascular amyloidosis ', ' Congophilic Angiopathy ', ' Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Collaborations ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' cohort ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Prevention ', ' neuropathology ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' White Matter Disease ', ' multimodality ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' sharing data ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Prevention trial ', ' cognitive ability ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' MRI biomarker ', ' clinical imaging ', ' ']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH2,2017,1256275,0.07678172258705646
"Assessing cellular aging in old and rejuvenated neurons from Alzheimer patients SUMMARY  Dr. Jerome Mertens is a stem cell biologist specialized in modeling human neurodegenerative diseases. During his graduate studies under the supervision of Dr. O. Brüstle (University of Bonn), Jerome was extensively trained in human stem cell and reprogramming technologies, and cellular neuroscience, and he published three first-author papers on utilizing human pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons to model Alzheimer's Disease (AD). As a postdoctoral researcher at the Salk Institute under the supervision of Dr. F.H. Gage, Dr. Mertens acquired an exceptional foundation in functional neuroscience, nuclear pore biology and imaging. Being entirely dedicated to advancing human in vitro disease models, Dr. Mertens' research focus was to better understand complex human brain disorders and the process of neuronal aging. He could show that direct conversion of human fibroblasts into induced neurons (iNs) preserves signatures of cell aging, while iPSC reprogramming erases them. As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Mertens thus far first-authored three primary research studies in Nature, Cell Stem Cell and Molecular Psychiatry. As an independent scientist, Dr. Mertens seeks bringing together his recent findings on modeling neuronal aging, his permanent interest in AD, and powerful systems biology and bioinformatic technologies to unravel the earliest age-dependent and disease- initiating mechanisms of sporadic AD. In his Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) proposal, Dr. Mertens, together with his Mentor Dr. F.H. Gage, and his Co-Mentors Dr. D. Galasko, Dr. M.W. Hetzer and Dr. G. Yeo, designed a dedicated training plan in systems biology and bioinformatics, and proposes a research project that sets out to reveal the impact of cellular aging in a human model for AD. In the first aim (K99 phase) Dr. Mertens will generate both phenotypically old and rejuvenated neurons from a large set of clinically well- characterized AD patients and matched controls to better understand the impact of neuronal aging on the pathology of sporadic AD. Following an unbiased transcriptome approach, he will analyze for AD-specific gene expression profiles and work to understand which of the AD-specific gene expression signatures and related mechanisms are age-dependent and which are age-independent. In a second aim (K99/R00 phases), Dr. Mertens will study the age-related dysregulation of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport and the import receptor RanBP17, which currently emerge as major topics in aging and neurodegenerative disease research. He will measure nucleo-cytoplasmic compartmentalization in young and old AD neurons and probe for nuclear transport-based mediators of age-dependent AD pathology using live cell imaging approaches. In a third aim (R00 phase), he will generate and analyze iNs from a large set of individuals suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and pre-symptomatic middle-aged donors, in addition to clinical AD patients. His goal is to find a trajectory in the transcriptomic AD motifs to pinpoint the earliest and potentially most treatable mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis, and to develop a biomarker for the detection of pre-disease AD.   NARRATIVE  The project by Dr. Mertens aims at deciphering the molecular and cell biological impact of human aging on Alzheimer's disease patient-specific induced neurons (iNs) and their rejuvenated counterparts (iPSC-iNs). Dr. Mertens will employ unbiased transcriptome approaches to analyze a clinically well-defined cohort of AD patient and control samples, and further extend the study to iNs from pre-AD (MCI) patients to find the earliest and most causative pathological mechanisms of the disease. Dr. Mertens will further extend his studies of age- dependent nuclear pore defects, and their effects on AD neurons.",Assessing cellular aging in old and rejuvenated neurons from Alzheimer

"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9459529,R01GM126550,"['Affect ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' anticancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Biology ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Communication ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' Label ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' drug sensitivity ', ' Research Activity ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' brain cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' user friendly software ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' gene expression assay ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Skeleton ', ' Regulation ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' disorder subtype ', ' disease subtype ', ' technique development ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' patient population ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' precision medicine ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,400000,0.10631509493526464
"An Integrated Reverse Engineering Approach Toward Rapid drug Re positioning for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and one of the leading sources of morbidity and mortality in the aging population. Despite enormous social and economic costs associated with AD, current drugs are directed towards symptomatic relief and none are curative. In this project titled “An integrated reverse engineering approach toward rapid drug repositioning for Alzheimer’s disease,” we propose to develop an innovative integrated drug repositioning strategy that combines computation-based drug prediction, computation-based human brain-blood-barrier (BBB) permeability prediction, retrospective large-scale clinical corroboration, and prospective experimental testing to rapidly identify anti-AD drug candidates. First, we will develop novel computational approaches to identify repositioning anti-AD candidates from all (>2,600) FDA-approved drugs. Second, we will develop novel multifaceted biology-based computational methods to predict which repositioned drug candidates can cross BBB in humans. Third, we will perform large-scale retrospective case-control studies to corroborate the clinical efficacy of repositioned drug candidates using patient electronic health record (EHR) data of >50 million patients. Finally, we will evaluate the therapeutic potential of promising repositioned candidates in experimental models. Our study will generate a large amount of data/knowledge/hypotheses that could serve as a starting point for us and others to conduct hypothesis-driven drug repositioning studies in other animal models of AD and in AD patients. We will build a comprehensive Alzheimer Drug Repositioning Knowledge Base (ADRKB) and develop interactive web applications to make ADRKB publicly available. The unique and powerful strength of our project is our ability to seamlessly combine novel computational predictions, retrospective clinical corroboration using patient EHRs, and experimental testing in animal models of AD to rapidly identify innovative drug candidates that may work in real-world AD patients. The repositioned drug candidates will have interpretable mechanisms of action, are highly likely to cross BBB in humans, have clinical effectiveness evidence gathered from ‘real-world’ AD patients, and have demonstrated efficacy in mouse models of AD. We anticipate that these findings can be expeditiously translated into clinical trials and benefit 5.4 million AD patients in United States and 47 million AD patients worldwide. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes enormous personal and societal burdens. Currently there exist no cures for AD. In this project titled “An integrated reverse engineering approach toward rapid drug repositioning for Alzheimer’s disease,” we propose to develop an innovative integrated drug repositioning strategy that combines novel computational drug prediction, novel computational brain-blood-barrier (BBB) permeability prediction, retrospective large-scale clinical corroboration, and prospective experimental testing to rapidly identify repositioned anti-AD drug candidates. The output of our project will be a list of ranked repositioned drug candidates with interpretable mechanisms of action, high BBB permeability in humans, supporting clinical efficacy evidence gathered from ‘real-world’ AD patients, and demonstrated efficacy in mouse models of AD. We anticipate that these findings can be expeditiously translated into clinical trials and benefit AD patients. Our study will generate a large amount of data/knowledge/hypotheses that could serve as a starting point for others to conduct hypothesis- driven biomedical and clinical drug repositioning studies in different animal models of AD and in patients.",An Integrated Reverse Engineering Approach Toward Rapid drug Re positioning for Alzheimer's Disease,9424314,R01AG057557,"['senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Animals ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Amyloid deposition ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Engineering ', ' Genes ', ' Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Patients ', ' Permeability ', ' Phenotype ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Drug Side Effects ', ' Adverse drug effect ', ' Work ', ' τ Proteins ', ' tau factor ', ' tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' tau Proteins ', ' Experimental Models ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neuro-degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' drug efficacy ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Provider ', ' therapeutic evaluation ', ' therapeutic testing ', ' Data ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' disease phenotype ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', "" Alzheimer's disease model "", ' AD model ', ' neurodegenerative phenotype ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' FDA approved ', ' phenomics ', ' drug candidate ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' ']",NIA,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,541537,0.3312690455442929
"Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease using structural systems pharmacology Abstract  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple health threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, efforts in drug discovery and repurposing for the treatment of AD have had limited success. The failure is largely attributed to the adoption of a reductionist model of “one-drug-one-gene- one-disease”. As AD is a multi-facet complex disease, a new treatment approach is urgently needed to simultaneously target multiple pathological processes responsible for the onset and progress of AD, some of which are also common to other diseases that cause dementia. In this application, we will develop an innovative translational bioinformatics approach to addressing challenges in AD drug discovery. Our approach is based on a new paradigm of systems pharmacology, which focuses on defining multiple targets to a single drug or a drug combination, and studying the effect of the drug(s) on perturbing disease-causing networks. Over the last ten years, we have developed a novel structural systems pharmacology (SSP) platform that can predict genome-wide high-resolution protein-chemical interactions and correlate molecular interactions with phenotype responses. The SSP platform synergistically combines novel methods from machine learning, bioinformatics, biophysics, and systems biology. We have successfully applied the SSP platform to drug repurposing, polypharmacology, side effect prediction, precision medicine, and Genome-Wide Association Studies. Building on our successful proof-of-concept studies, and in close collaborations with experimental laboratories, we will develop, and rigorously test a novel SSP approach to AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology. Firstly, we will develop a multi-layered drug-gene-pathway-disease-side effect network model (MULAN) that links FDA-approved drugs with dementia and side effects through protein-chemical interactions, gene-disease associations, chemical-disease associations, and dementia-associated biological pathways through integrating multiple omics data. Secondly, we will improve and apply our proven successful SSP platform, which can accurately infer novel relations from sparse and noisy MULAN, to identify safe FDA- approved drugs that can be repurposed for AD treatment. Finally, we will experimentally test FDA-approved drugs identified for their binding activity of drug targets and anti-AD potency in cell and animal models. The successful completion of this project will provide an integrated computational modeling framework for AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology as well as identify novel targeted anti-AD therapeutics toward pre-clinical trials. Relevance Statement Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, AD is a complex disease that has been extremely hard to treat with the conventional approach. New methods that can reuse old drugs to target mulple pathological processes in AD may provide new solutions to effective AD treatment.",Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease using structural

"Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology 7. Project Summary/Abstract  In Alzheimer's disease (AD), irreversible neurological damage takes place years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, it is recognized that the development of AD dementia treatment and prevention strategies relies on the early detection of presymptomatic pathology. Previous studies demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD and precedes the formation of plaques and tangles that are hallmarks of this disease. The premise of this study is based on the unique sensitivity of the brain to systemic bioenergetic decline due to its exceptionally high metabolic demand. We hypothesize that bioenergetic capacity is related to early AD pathology and that bioenergetic decline is associated with the long term progression and severity of this disease. Recent work by our group and others demonstrate that blood- based bioenergetic profiling, utilizing cellular respirometry, provides a reliable measure of systemic mitochondrial function. The proposed study will determine whether blood cell bioenergetics is related to AD risk, pathology, cognitive performance, and changes in these parameters over time. Our long term goal is to develop a minimally invasive screening tool that can be used in a clinic/community setting to identify candidates for more intensive diagnostic testing, such as CSF biomarker analysis and brain imaging.  This project will be completed in an efficient and cost-effective manner by leveraging resources provided by the NIA-funded Wake Forest Alzheimer' Disease Center Clinical Core (ADCCC). Participants in the ADCCC represent a spectrum of AD risk and disease progression and are being extensively characterized for AD pathologies at baseline and 3 year follow ups. Our preliminary data from ADCCC participants indicate that bioenergetic capacity, measured in blood cells, is lower in participants with mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, our data suggest that bioenergetic deficits are already apparent in cognitively normal participants at high risk for AD. The aims of the proposed study are: 1) To determine bioenergetic profiles most strongly associated with AD risk and reporters of AD pathology (cognitive performance, CSF Aβ42/tau, hippocampal volume, brain amyloid, and cerebral glucose metabolism); 2) To determine the changes in bioenergetic profiles related to the 3 year progression of cognitive decline and reporters of AD pathology; and, 3) To determine the relationships of mitochondrial content and inflammation with bioenergetic capacity, and reporters of AD pathology at baseline and at follow-up. A central goal of the proposed study is to determine the specific bioenergetic parameters that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Therefore, in addition to convention analytical approaches, we will employ state of the art Machine Learning analyses to identify individual parameters or multivariate signatures that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Completion of this project can impact the detection of presymptomatic AD, provide insights into mechanisms underlying bioenergetic decline associated with AD, and broadly advance translational bioenergetics research. 8. Project Narrative  It is widely recognized that the implementation of successful Alzheimer's disease prevention and treatment strategies rely on the identification of patients at risk for developing the disease. The proposed project will examine blood based bioenergetic profiling as a minimally invasive strategy for determining Alzheimer's disease risk and presymptomatic pathology. The completion of our study aims will advance the development of an affordable screening tool that can be utilized in a clinical/community setting to identify individuals who are candidates for

"Sphingosine-1-phosphate induced modulation of inflammation in aging and Alzheimer's disease Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive molecule that signals by activating S1P receptors (S1P1-5) to regulate cellular processes in systemic immunity and inflammation. Accumulating evidence indicates that ab- normalities of S1P signaling are associated with brain aging and with the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's dis- ease (AD). Fingolimod, a sphingosine analog used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), acts through S1P1 in lymphocytes to reduce their infiltration into the CNS and thereby provides therapeutic effects against subsequent neuroinflammation. Fingolimod crosses the blood brain barrier and emerging evidence suggests the direct neuroprotective effect of fingolimod on CNS cells. In experimental models of AD fingolimod appears to reduce the production and the neurotoxicity of Aβ peptide and promote neuroprotection of microglia and neurons. We have reported that in 5xFAD mice, a transgenic model of AD, oral fingolimod treatment decreases the activation of microglia and reactive astrocytes, decreases Aβ levels, and increases hippocampal neuro- genesis. Our preliminary data show that most of the neuroprotective effects of fingolimod in 5xFAD mice occur at a low dose with major effects on neuroinflammatory markers. We hypothesize that aging alters the S1P sig- naling system in the brain and drives the proinflammatory activation of astrocytes and microglia that is acceler- ated by the buildup of Aβ and that treatment with S1P modulators will interfere with this process and may affect age- and AD-related neuropathology and behavioral deficits. To test this hypothesis we will use two different transgenic mouse models of AD (5xFAD and PSAPP) that accumulate Aβ at different rates such that similar amounts of Aβ are deposited in the brain at different ages. The study includes 3 aims. The first two aims are mechanistic studies to determine the effect of age and AD-like pathology on the S1P system in wild type mice and in the mouse models of AD (aim 1) and to determine the effects of S1P receptor modulators on neuroin- flammation in aging and AD mouse models and on AD-related neuropathology and cognitive function in these models (aim 2). The latter studies will include a prevention arm by treating the mice before the emergence of AD-like pathology until old age (1-18 months), and an advanced disease arm by treating the mice with well- established pathology (15-18 months). The outcome measures will include cognitive behavior, amyloidosis, ac- tivation of astrocytes and microglia, S1P system, neurotrophin signaling, e.g. BDNF/TrkB, cytokines, synaptic- glial- and apoptotic markers, and small molecules determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) that reflect neural metabolism, excitotoxic, oxidative, and osmotic stress, as well as membrane integrity. Machine learning tools will be employed to integrate these data sets. The third aim will be the translational arm of the study to determine the effects of S1P modulation on indices of neuronal and glial function in aging and in AD mouse models using noninvasive techniques including in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging and spectroscopy (MRI/MRS) and positron emission tomography. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent devastating and incurable disease that robs elderly of their mental abilities and creates an enormous burden on families and caregivers. As our population ages, AD is becoming a major public health concern. Our proposed studies are designed to explore the poorly understood signaling pathway mediated by S1P and its receptors, as a component of the pathophysiology of AD and a therapeutic target for this

"PREDICT-ADFTD: Multimodal Imaging Prediction of AD/FTD and Differential Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY  Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the most common form of dementia in adults over the age of 65, and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the leading cause of dementia in middle age, with the behavioral variant subtype (bvFTD) being the most prevalent form. The relationships between clinical syndromes and pathological causes are complex, which makes accurate diagnosis difficult. For example, multiple studies have indicated that a significant proportion of cases of AD-like dementia show evidence of non-AD pathology, such as inclusions of the transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a protein associated with clinical FTD. Also, AD neuropathology has been found in 15–30% of patient with the clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). As treatment agents with potential disease-modifying effects are developed, sensitive and specific biomarkers will be needed, so that they can be tested and then eventually used in the appropriate patient populations. In this project, we will focus on clinically diagnosed bvFTD and AD patients, and apply machine learning to multimodal neuroimaging (T1, FDG-PET) data pooled from large, multisite studies of AD and FTD. Our goal is to develop novel biomarkers that can differentiate bvFTD, AD and controls. Our hypothesis is that each neuropathology is associated with a distinct biomarker signature, and these signatures can be discovered through well-characterized clinical, neurological and neuroanatomical profiles. We will use available amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of β-amyloid and tau to assess the robustness of our predictions of AD neuropathologies. In Aim 1 we will use cross-sectional and longitudinal structural imaging to develop predictive biomarker models for differentiating bvFTD vs. AD. In Aim 2 we will use cross-sectional and longitudinal FDG-PET imaging to develop predictive biomarker models. In Aim 3 we will evaluate the combination of structural and FDG-PET imaging as predictive biomarker models.  Relevance: This research supports NIH initiatives on long-term, personalized precision medicine and big data science. Our predictive biomarker models can inform participant selection in clinical trials so that we can identify disease-modifying treatments with greater power. Our system-biology approach can enable us to generate new questions on mechanisms underlying the origin and progression of neuro-pathological processes, create new data and computational tools that can in turn generate new insights and new hypotheses. NARRATIVE  Accurate diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is difficult because the relationships between clinical syndromes, and pathological and genetic causes are complex. In this project, we propose to use machine learning technologies to develop powerful predictive biomarkers that can distinguish bvFTD, AD and healthy controls, using well-characterized clinical, neurological and neuroanatomical data from multiple national databases. As treatment agents with potential disease-modifying effects are developed, sensitive and specific biomarkers can be tested and then eventually used in the appropriate patient

"The Macrovascular and Microvascular Contributions to Alzheimer's Disease: MESA VASCAD Project Summary Improving vascular health for delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is identified as a critical goal by the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias Conference, the 2015 NIA AD Summit and PAR-15-356 (to which this application is responding). Yet, critical barriers exist to implementing vascular prevention strategies for AD, and elucidating the role of midlife metabolic, macro- and micro- vascular factors in AD is essential to addressing these barriers. Each type of factor may manifest different pathologies in the brain that contribute to dementia sub-types, making a new and sufficiently comprehensive clinical trial a costly and time-consuming undertaking. To address this essential gap, we propose to leverage the rich longitudinal cohort data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study with the addition of detailed cognitive testing and multimodal brain neuroimaging – the MESA VASCAD study. MESA participants at the Wake Forest site (46% African-American, 54% non-Hispanic Caucasian) have already undergone extensive metabolic and vascular phenotyping, repeated retinal imaging and a brief cognitive assessment in 2010-2012. The MESA VASCAD study will add clinical and cognitive assessments (Uniform Data Set and supplemental cognitive tests); neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid PET); and reanalysis of retinal images. We propose to enroll 540 MESA participants in 2 years and repeat assessments 3 years later to more fully characterize targeted, modifiable vascular risk factors for AD. Through our Specific Aims, we will (1) test the hypothesis that baseline macrovascular and microvascular biomarkers in middle-age predict both standard AD neuroimaging outcomes (e.g. hippocampal volume and amyloid deposition assessed with PET) and more novel cerebrovascular biomarkers (e.g. microinfarcts, lacunar infarcts, neurite density and cerebral microbleeds); (2) determine if changes in metabolic and vascular biomarkers over 15 years predict cognitive and AD biomarker trajectory; and (3) using high-dimensional machine learning approaches, determine common, differential and interactive metabolic and vascular risk factor profiles among racial and APOE genotype groups. This proposed ancillary study, approved by the MESA Steering Committee, is led by a New Investigator with an experienced, multi- disciplinary team of collaborators. The MESA study is an ideal cohort for interrogating the questions in this proposal: it has highly detailed longitudinal risk factor data collected over 15+ years in a diverse cohort, which we can leverage and augment with cerebrovascular biomarkers, AD biomarkers, and cognitive reassessments - thereby creating a comprehensive brain phenotype dataset for vascular and AD risk factors. These new data will enable us to examine the timing and impact of vascular biomarkers on dementia biomarkers and cognitive trajectories before a diagnosis of pre-clinical and clinical AD-related disorders, meeting a critical gap in information that will help guide the development of novel therapeutic or prevention strategies for various forms of AD-related dementias. Project Narrative Vascular and metabolic disorders are proposed as potent modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, and may provide key routes for therapeutic and preventive interventions. We propose to leverage the vast resources of the NIH-sponsored Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study to examine the potential contributions of macrovascular and microvascular subclinical disease to AD-related pathology. At the Wake Forest MESA site, we will add neuroimaging, repeated cognitive testing, and reprocessing of existing digital retinal scans with novel measures of retinal microvascular architecture.",The

"Longitudinal Analysis for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in elderly people worldwide. Due to the fact that the longitudinal abnormality associated with AD can be detected in vivo, neuroimaging measures have been playing an increasingly important role in searching for biomarkers of AD that can be used for early diagnosis, progression monitoring, and therapy responses measurement. The goal of this project is to create a set of cutting-edge computational tools for identifying very early biomarkers of AD and alert AD progression via longitudinal image analysis. The key to achieve high sensitivity and specificity AD diagnosis of individuals is the stable longitudinal measurements. In light of this, the candidate will first develop a novel learning-based 4D (3D+t) landmark detector (Aim 1) to find the landmark locations at all time points simultaneously. The trajectories of landmark set form a compact 4D shape representation to achieve temporal consistency in registering longitudinal image sequence to the template (Aim 2). As a result, the consistency of low level features extracted from MR or PET images can be significantly improved. Since the subject-specific patterns of structural/functional changes, although more relevant to AD diagnosis of individuals, is very subtle compared to huge variation across subjects, the candidate will further develop a supervised deep neural network to learn the latent high-level spatial-temporal patterns by coupled stacked auto-encoder and temporal max pooling (Aim 2). The learned spatial-temporal morphological patterns consist of (1) cross- sectional features from MR and PET images, and (2) dynamic short/long term longitudinal patterns w.r.t. different number of historical time points. In a clinical setting, not all patients have a large and complete set of neuroimaging data, or an equal number of imaging scans. In order to eventually translate to clinic arena, a novel AD detector that uses a spatial-temporal hyper-graph learning framework (Aim 3) is proposed to not only provide high sensitivity and specificity in AD diagnosis but also solve the above difficulties. To evaluate the diagnostic value, we will apply our trained AD detector to ADNI dataset and patient data collected in UNC (Aim 3). Finally, we will package all our developed methods into a software package and release it freely to the neuroimaging community, to facilitate other AD-biomarker-exploration projects performed in other institutes. Project Narrative This proposal aims for the development of novel neuroimaging analysis methods for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using longitudinal image data. In particular, a set of automated algorithms will be created to aid the difficult task of analyzing subtle and complex morphological change patterns of Alzheimer's disease during the disease progression. The successful completion of this project will represent an import milestone in neuroimaging research by bringing forth the fruition of a powerful and practical system for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at individual level, for potential effective treatment.",Longitudinal Analysis for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,9344522,K01AG049089,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Attention ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Deformity ', ' Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Anatomic Abnormality ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' interest ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' Graph ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' image registration ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' task analysis ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' functional loss ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' Structural defect ', ' structural anomalies ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' Structural malformation ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' individual patient ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' inter-individual variation ', ' interindividual variation ', ' frontotemporal degeneration ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K01,2017,117098,0.3243259608580496
"The Longitudinal Course O\F Imaging Biomarkers in People At RISK of AD The goal of this ongoing R01 is to chart the progression of pathobiologic markers of presymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and their effect on neural function and cognition in a late-middle-aged cohort enriched with risk for AD. There is an appreciable gap in knowledge about the temporal disease course in this age range that this ongoing project has been directly addressing with serial multimodal imaging including amyloid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection, and serial cognitive measurement. In the next funding cycle we will add a new positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technique sensitive to fibrillar tau [F-18]THK5351 indexing neurofibrillary pathology. In the prior funding period we recruited 179 individuals from a registry of 1,545 people at risk for AD known as WRAP (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention). We found that [C-11]PIB amyloid burden is detectable in 20% of people with parental history of AD at a mean age of 60. Baseline amyloid is more extensive in the presence of higher CSF total tau levels, and 2-year increases in PiB amyloid are significantly predicted by higher baseline CSF tau. The hypothesis for this renewal is that tau- related neurofibrillar pathology begins early (in accord with the neuropathology literature) in people at AD risk and its strategic spatial burden explains changes in amyloid, neural function and cognitive decline. Aim 1: To test the premise that amyloid burden is necessary but not sufficient to evoke preclinical cognitive change. We will examine effects of longitudinal amyloid and tau change on episodic memory trajectories over time in 235 at risk individuals including all subjects we previously enrolled and follow them over 2 years with advanced multimodal imaging and CSF. Aim 2: To assess the effects of tau and amyloid imaging on MRI and CSF indicators of neural injury and function. Aim 3: To develop a multimodal disease marker to maximize efficiency of clinical trials in preclinical AD. Following our work in creating tools for efficient clinical trials in MCI, we will extend these concepts to the pre-MCI phase of disease utilizing deep learning architectures with tau, amyloid and structural imaging inputs. We will also examine change over time in tau, amyloid and cognition as outcomes. As any of these features considered singularly may be affected by age, and as amyloid and tau may be `necessary but not sufficient' by themselves, a derived multimodal marker may have eventual clinical utility in enriching prevention trials with those most likely to progress, and increasing power to detect change attributable to preclinical interventions. Significance: Relative tau and amyloid imaging profiles have not been empirically established in the presymptomatic time frame and this information is urgently needed to identify incipient disease. No comparable studies exist regarding the evolution of tau and amyloid signal in the critical late-middle-age time frame of preclinical AD. This ongoing project represents a unique opportunity to examine the earliest determinants of AD progression, when treatments may be most meaningful. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/ NARRATIVE Identifying the earliest neuropathological features of AD including tau and amyloid pathology will improve early detection and inform clinical trials in the presymptomatic time frame. This project will examine these features with advanced imaging methods in a cohort at risk for AD who are largely asymptomatic. An outgrowth of the project will be information about the rate of change in AD pathology which can help us plan clinical trials in this population using derived outcomes about the brain itself, thereby reducing the number of subjects needed in a trial and increasing sensitivity to detecting change.",The Longitudinal Course O\F Imaging Biomarkers in People At RISK of AD,9341059,R01AG021155,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Amyloid ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' brain blood flow ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Pathology ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' amyloid-b protein ', ' amyloid beta ', ' abeta ', ' a beta peptide ', ' Aβ ', ' Amyloid β-Protein ', ' Amyloid β-Peptide ', ' Amyloid β ', ' Amyloid Protein A4 ', ' Amyloid Beta-Peptide ', "" Amyloid Alzeheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein "", "" Alzheimer's amyloid "", "" Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein "", ' Alzheimer beta-Protein ', ' Amyloid beta-Protein ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' tangle ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' τ Proteins ', ' tau factor ', ' tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' tau Proteins ', ' neural injury ', ' nerve injury ', ' Entorhinal Area ', ' entorhinal cortex ', ' Hippocampal Formation ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Atrophic ', ' Atrophy ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Semantic memory ', ' interest ', ' Episodic memory ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Neurophysiology -

"Early detection of asymptomatic middle-age adults at risk for AD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a pressing public health need to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its earliest, asymptomatic, stages. This would immensely facilitate the conduct of targeted clinical trials, the development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents, and, ultimately, the curtailment of the looming epidemic that AD poses. Such an endeavor necessarily requires a multidisciplinary team of investigators with complementary areas of expertise. The goal of this Beeson Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award in Aging (K23) proposal is to provide the candidate with the experience, knowledge, and skillset necessary to carry out high quality, clinically- relevant, aging research so that he might effectively participate in and lead such a multidisciplinary group in the future. The proposal, therefore, comprises a unified set of research and training activities that are well-tuned to the candidate's transition from a K23 trainee to an independent investigator. The training plan seamlessly combines meetings with mentors, formal coursework, didactic activities, hands-on training, leadership training, and professional development. Specific training goals include: (1) cultivate a more nuanced understanding of aging and geriatric cognitive disorders, (2) receive dedicated training in neuroimaging methods, (3) develop advanced neuroimaging data analytic expertise, (4) receive ongoing training in the responsible conduct of research, and (5) obtain the career guidance needed for successful transition from the K23 to an independent research career, and maturation into a future leader in the neuroimaging of preclinical AD. In turn, the overall objectives of the research project are to use novel multi-modality machine learning techniques to specify the characteristic pattern of brain changes that is distinctive of persons in  Stage 3 preclinical AD (the stage hypothesized to impart the greatest risk of future progression to AD), and then determine whether asymptomatic, middle-aged adults who exhibit such brain changes are more likely to experience future cognitive decline. These objectives are directly relevant to the global effort to halt AD via early detection of cognitively-healthy persons at high  risk for progressing to AD. This is because current national guidelines for detecting risk for AD i asymptomatic persons call for extensive evaluations (e.g., nuclear imaging and lumbar puncture) that are expensive, not always well-tolerated by research volunteers and, more importantly, not widely available. In contrast, this project will rigorously assess brain changes i Stage 3 preclinical AD using routine, non-invasive, and broadly-deployable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of brain structure and blood flow. A specific deliverable of this project is the derivation of a single, quantitative, abnormality score that can be used-in combination with pertinent health information-for identifying, on an individual level, asymptomatic persons at heightened risk for AD. Such persons may then benefit from more extensive AD biomarker testing, closer monitoring, and treatment with disease-modifying drugs when such drugs become available. The project's success has material potential to significantly extend the public health reach of the proposed guidelines for defining preclinical AD. The three specific aims addressed in this project are: (1) specify the pattern of brain changes on MRI that is characteristic of Stage 3 preclinical AD, (2) prospectively assess the prognostic utility of an aggregate measure of midlife structural-functional MRI brain changes, and (3) preliminarily evaluate how individual differences related to cognitive reserve and genetic risk modify the association between early brain changes and future decline. Completion of the interrelated set of research and training activities proposed in this K23 will greatly foster the candidate's development into an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in conducting translational and multidisciplinary neuroimaging studies of preclinical AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To forestall the looming AD epidemic, there is need for highly sensitive yet easily deployable methods for identifying cognitively-healthy persons at high risk for AD. This project responds to this public health imperative by pursuing the development of an MRI aggregate measure that is grounded by established AD biomarkers, and is predictive of future cognitive decline in asymptomatic middle-aged adults.",Early detection of asymptomatic middle-age adults at risk for AD,9279032,K23AG045957,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', '

"Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and Clinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Cohorts The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is a prospective, community-based 3-generational study that enrolled participants between ages 20-50 and has examined them every 2-4 years to collect extensive lifestyle, vascular, biomarker data; 9300 have GWAS. Embedded in this cohort are 1036 multigenerational families. Surveillance for AD dementia (and MCI) has been ongoing for over 4 decades. We have identified 1421 incident AD, 1767 MCI, enrolled 800+ in a brain donation program, obtained 7000+ 1.5T brain MRI, and repeated, detailed neuropsychological assessments. We have recently obtained extensive omics in ~6000 (gene expression, methylation, miRNA, metabolomics and proteomics) and genomics (50X whole genome sequences [WGS] in 4197 with pedigree-based imputation to 6554) through the NHLBI funded SABRe CVD (omics) and TOPMed (WGS) programs. We seek to leverage these rich resources (>$25 million). We propose these specific aims: AIM 1 is to examine and explain temporal trends in clinical AD dementia in the FHS cohorts. The age-specific incidence of dementia has declined over the past 4 decades among FHS participants (in press). However, the reasons for this decline remain unclear. We thus propose to continue tracking temporal trends in AD dementia and MCI through intensive surveillance, and verifying diagnoses at autopsy. We hypothesize that better education, treatment of some vascular factors and protective lifestyle changes (diet, activity, social engagement) may partially explain these trends. AIM 2 is to identify the patterns and predictors of preclinical AD within FHS families by obtaining (i) a novel circulating biomarker (plasma tau on 8000+ persons, using samples collected 5-15 years ago and repeat assay in 450) to supplement 1000+ biomarkers already available, and (ii) brain imaging with tau- and amyloid- PET, 3TMRI, including assessment of functional connectivity, tractography and blood flow, in 450 dementia- and stroke-free, FHS participants age 35-75 on whom we have (a) directly verified familial cognition and AD dementia status (both parents and all 4 grandparents were FHS participants), and also (b) have WGS and omics data. AIM 3 is to utilize the available WGS and extensive `omics' data for deep molecular phenotyping of AD. We will undertake conventional family-based WGS analyses of AD dementia and preclinical AD endophenotypes and novel high dimensional (co-expression, network, systems-based) analyses in collaboration with Drs. DeJager (PI of Accelerated Medicine Partnerships-AD, with omics data in 1200 brains), Witten (award-winning mathematician in applying graphical analysis to omics) and Levy (PI of SABRe-CVD at FHS). We will validate our findings in unrelated and multi-ethnic (Omni) FHS participants, through collaborations with other cohorts, and share all data through dbGaP and BioLINCC for analyses by others. We expect to identify new biologic pathways, drug targets and biomarkers for AD, especially those applicable to the preclinical stage of AD and those explaining promising trends in AD risk; such pathways should prove most useful for AD prevention. Whereas the total number of persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) is increasing as the population ages, we have 4 decades of Framingham data suggesting that the risk at any given age is declining. We plan to study the reasons for this hopeful trend in detail through continuing our surveillance for dementia and cognitive impairment, collecting cutting edge brain imaging (amyloid and tau-PET, volumes, connectivity and perfusion on MRI) in the dementia-free (preclinical AD), and using sophisticated analysis of very extensive genetic and omic data already collected on Framingham subjects. This could help us better understand AD trends and biology and identify new biomarkers and treatment targets.   ","Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and

"Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease Consortium Project Summary While the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increases with advancing age, approximately 5% of AD patients develop symptoms before age 65 (~280,000 Americans). The vast majority (90%-95%) of EOAD patients do not have a known mutation in APP or PSEN1/2, and only ~50% are APOE ε4 carriers. Unlike late-onset AD (LOAD), 30-64% of EOAD have non-amnestic presentations, leading to missed or delayed diagnosis. Despite being highly motivated and having few comorbidities AD, EOAD patients are commonly excluded from large scale observational biomarker studies (e.g. ADNI and DIAN) and therapeutic trials due to their young age, non- amnestic deficits, or absence of known pathogenic mutations. Furthermore, studies suggest high heritability in EOAD in the absence of known mutations or APOE ε4, signifying that this population may be enriched for novel genetic risk factors. Emerging biomarkers of amyloid and tau have not been systematically characterized in this population, and clinical and neuroimaging measures employed in LOAD may be insensitive to baseline deficits and disease progression in EOAD, which predominantly involve non-memory cognitive domains and posterior cortical neurodegeneration. To fill this gap in AD research, we plan to recruit and longitudinally follow 400 amyloid PET-positive EOAD subjects meeting NIA-AA criteria for MCI due to AD or probable AD dementia (including primary amnestic, dysexecutive, language and visuospatial presentations) and 100 age-matched controls. Participants will undergo clinical assessments, psychometric testing, MRI, amyloid ([18F]Florbetaben) and tau ([18F]AV1451) PET, CSF and blood draw for collection of DNA, RNA, plasma, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Patients will be assessed at three time points – baseline (both EOAD and controls), 12 months (EOAD only, all measures) and 24 months (EOAD, all measures except PET). Methods will be harmonized with ADNI and DIAN. We will comprehensively characterize cognitive, imaging and biofluid changes over time in EOAD, and compare to a matched sample of LOAD participants identified in ADNI. We will employ machine learning algorithms to develop sensitive clinical and imaging measures of EOAD progression. An exploratory aim will apply next generation sequencing to assess for novel genetic risk factors for disease. The study will also establish a network of EOAD research sites and set the stage for the launch of clinical trials in this population. Project Narrative Patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD), occurring before age 65, are an understudied segment of the population of patients with AD, and many treatment studies exclude these younger individuals. In this project, we plan to recruit and follow more than 400 people with EOAD in order to better understand changes in thinking abilities, changes in the brain, and changes in blood and spinal fluid, with the goal of using this information to design new treatment trials inclusive of this segment of the AD population.",Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease Consortium,9562717,R56AG057195,"['ages ', ' Age

"The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as Revealed by Next-Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of disability and death in the US and a major global public health problem. Time is running short if we wish to avert a global public health disaster with untold suffering, disruption of families, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies. Solutions will come only from innovative research. Genomic studies for late-onset AD (LOAD) have identified over 20 risk loci; however, translating the relevant molecules identified by genomics to AD-specific mechanistic pathways has been challenging. Our application, entitled “The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline Revealed by Next- Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging,” is highly responsive to this urgent scientific need by proposing a uniquely innovative molecular imaging platform called multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) that will determine high dimensional protein interactions for AD-relevant molecules identified by genomics studies in normal and pathological states. Our proposal has three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we propose to analyze four regions in healthy aged brains: two sectors of the hippocampal pyramidal layer and from two isocortical regions. Next- generation MIBI instrumentation will be used to image simultaneously 30+ proteins that mark subtypes of neurons, synapses, and non-neuronal cells, while covering regulatory signaling, neuro-inflammatory components, and AD risk gene protein products with subcellular resolution. In Aim 2, we propose to use the same multiplexed imaging methods in AD brain stratified by APOE genotype. We will analyze these data with statistical machine learning methods already established in our laboratory, similar to what we have done previously with different cancers and the immune system. In Aim 3, using infrastructure we have already have established, we will create a web-based portal where all of the images from this study can be accessed, multi- color overlays generated ad hoc, and all the features we derive shared freely. We propose a transformative, collaborative approach to AD that leverages a long-standing NIA-funded longitudinal cohort and is highly responsive to the National Alzheimer's Plan. These novel insights will illuminate pathways that hold potential for new therapeutic targets and will create a shared research resource and analysis platform for the community of scientists committed to developing solutions for AD. Project Narrative AD is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the ageing American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. The overarching goal of this proposal is to generate a phenotypic landscape of cognitive decline, to understand modulation of cognitive decline during compensation and relate genetic predisposition to changes in phenotypic landscape defined by muti-parametric measurements using enabling technologies like multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI).  ",The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as

"Proinflammatory Endophenotype to predict NSAID treatment response Alzheimer's trials PROJECT SUMMARY - No Changes from awarded parent application It is our hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are heterogeneous conditions and, therefore, a paradigm shift is required to identify specific subpopulations for targeted interventions. This approach has generated significant success in other complex diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. A key opportunity in this context is the identification of those most likely to benefit from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs and other anti-inflammatory compounds. The relation between inflammation and the development of AD, MCI, and cognitive decline has received a great deal of attention with basic science and observational human studies demonstrating a protective effect against cognitive loss. Likewise, in our work, inflammation has been a key mechanism in the biological profile that is indicative of disease presence. Based on a wealth of literature (epidemiological, cross-sectional, pathobiological and animal model), multiple clinical trials have been conducted to determine the utility of NSAID compounds in treating or preventing AD (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study [ADCS] AD and MCI anti-inflammatory trials; Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial [ADAPT]); however, each of these studies failed to demonstrate therapeutic benefit, in fact some patients may have exhibited worsening cognitive performance with treatment. Our preliminary data suggests that particular subsets of patients in these trials did benefit from treatment and that our blood-based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify both positive and adverse responders within these trials. Here we propose to leverage three previously conducted clinical trials to test our hypothesis that our blood- based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify the subsets of patients who benefited from these previously conducted clinical trials. By conducting proteomic assays from existing biorepositories from the ADCS and ADAPT, we will address the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate the utility of the proinflammatory endophenotype as a means for patient selection into NSAID therapy for treating and preventing AD; Specific Aim 2. To determine if change in proinflammatory endophenotype scores over time is a biomarker of therapeutic response. By leveraging a highly innovative method and substantial existing resources, the current project addresses a significant need in the search for novel approaches AD therapeutics. The significance of the current project is the identification of a specific subset of patients who will experience clinically significant cognitive benefit from administration of NSAID medication. If successful, the current project will set the stage for a novel clinical trial that enrolls patients specifically based on baseline proinflammatory endophenotype scores for administration of NSAID therapy. In the long-term, this line of research is designed to build a person-centered (i.e. personalized) approach to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE - No Changes from awarded parent application Alzheimer's diseases are a growing public health crisis impacting millions of elders world-wide with a health care cost greater than cancer and equivalent to cardiovascular disease. Current treatments only slow progression of the disease and new strategies are urgently needed. The relevance of the current project is the validation of a person-centered approach to treating Alzheimer's disease by identifying specific subgroups that are most likely to respond to targeted therapies. The outcomes of this project will fundamentally change the approach to the search for novel therapies for AD from the “one-size-fits-all” approach to the search for specific subgroups that can be treated with targeted medications.",Proinflammatory Endophenotype to predict NSAID treatment response Alzheimer's trials,9752900,R01AG051848,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older

"Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, affecting 1 in 8 individuals over 65 years old in the US. Within AD, approximately 40-60% individuals are affected by psychotic symptoms (AD+P), which are associated with more rapid cognitive decline, greater disability, mortality and caregiver burden, resulting in a disproportionately large disease burden. Recent studies indicate a genetic basis for AD+P risk, but the molecular basis of AD+P remains largely uncharacterized, hindering the search for appropriate treatments and novel therapeutics. In this proposal, we seek to systematically dissect the mechanistic basis of AD+P by systematic generation, integration, and experimental dissection of transcriptional and epigenomic phenotypes across two brain regions and four cell types. (1) We profile single-cell RNA-seq and cell-type specific H3K27ac ChIP-seq across 192 post-mortem brain samples, each in two regions across AD patients with psychosis, AD patients with no psychosis, schizophrenia patients with no AD, and control individuals. (2) We integrate the resulting datasets with genetic information and GWAS data to predict driver genes, regions, variants, and pathways underlying AD+P using state-of-the-art machine learning methods for causality, mediation analysis, and genetic Bayesian fine- mapping. (3) We use our computational predictions to guide a systematic dissection of the molecular underpinnings of AD+P using a modular and programmable CRISPR-Cas9 methodology in iPSC lines to modulate regulatory elements, genes and alleles, and measure the resulting molecular and cellular phenotypes in cell-autonomous and non-autonomous phenotypes. If successful, this ambitious proposal has the potential to provide the first mechanistic insights on the development of psychotic symptoms in AD+P and/or P-AD, reveal functional risk variants and target genes for therapeutic intervention that will likely influence clinical management in order to alleviate the personal and societal burden associated with these disorders.

"Alzheimer's Disease Radio-Pathomics ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and common cause of dementia in elderly individuals. The loss of memory, inability to learn, decreased language function, among other neurological deficits, affects social functioning, and are catastrophic to maintaining daily life. The progression of AD eventually causes death within 5-10 years, and during this time the burden of patient care falls on an already stressed healthcare system. In 2017, it is estimated that AD cost the US $259 billion and by 2050 estimates could be as much as $1.1 trillion.  The main focus of our ongoing R01CA218144 project is to map the intratumoral and intertumoral heterogeneities of glioblastoma brain tumors at molecular, cellular, and tissue scales using whole brain samples aligned to clinical MRI scans. This supplement, in response to NOT-AG-18-008, looks to extend this technology into the diagnosis and treatment of AD.  Central Hypothesis: Microscopic cytological features of Alzheimer’s disease are detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging.  Rationale: To date, Radiological-Pathological (Rad-Path) imaging studies of AD have been extremely limited due to the difficulty in recruiting patients for both imaging and brain donation. The departments of radiology and pathology at the Medical College of Wisconsin have an ongoing brain donation program for patients with glioblastoma that enables us to correlate imaging findings to the underlying pathology using whole brain tissue samples. This extensive tissue and imaging bank has been used to validate imaging technology by combining complementary radiographic and pathological information. This growing one-of-a-kind dataset will be extended to include the recruitment of patients with AD participating in the Alzheimer’s Connectome Project.  Our preliminary results from our ongoing brain cancer studies suggest that hidden untapped information within the macroscopic imaging can be used to predict the presence of invasive tumor. Completion of these aims may establish an additional imaging biomarker for predicting AD pathology, and as efforts move forward to personalize treatment, this information will be invaluable in the clinical setting. !

"Role of the Extracellular Matrix in the Pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disorder: Regulation by OTX2 Project Summary. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is increasingly conceived as a disorder of the synapse. Yet, despite decades of investigations, the relationship between synaptic pathology and well established β-amyloid and tau pathology is not well understood. Emerging evidence strongly indicates that the extracellular matrix (ECM) may represent a critical element in this relationship, largely neglected thus far. The ECM, a molecular network representing 20% of the brain volume, plays a key role in neuroprotection, synaptic stabilization and plasticity, and interacts with β-amyloid and tau. It organizes into aggregates such as perineuronal nets (PNNs), organized ECM perisynaptic structures enveloping neuronal populations and regulating synaptic stabilization and neuroprotection. Based on preliminary data showing a dramatic loss of PNN integrity and significant changes of ECM composition in AD, we put forth that the ECM may represent a key element of pathophysiological mechanisms involving synaptic, β-amyloid and tau pathology in AD. However, little is known about expression and function of ECM and their relevance in Alzheimer Disease. Our central hypotheses for this supplemental application are that ECM abnormalities, mediated by altered expression of the transcription factor OTX2 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), may represent a key link between synaptic disruption and β-amyloid and tau pathology in AD, potentially contributing to cognitive decline in this disorder. We will test our hypotheses through two specific aims: Specific Aim 1 will expand our robust preliminary dataset on OTX2 and extracellular matrix regulation probing the dysregulation of OTX2, MMPs and ECM in AD. Specifically, this aim will test the hypothesis that a dysregulation of OTX2 and MMPs in the choroid plexus is part of an upstream signaling cascade responsible for a disintegration of PNN/ECM and subsequent synaptic loss in the brain parenchyma, specifically the amygdala. Specific Aim 2 will use machine-learning technologies to extract symptom dimensions based on the NIH RDoc definitions from tissue donors' records including a model of cognition that has been validated against neuropsychiatric testing. This process will be scaled up to develop a rich multi-dimensional phenotypic index and integrated with results from studies in Specific Aim 1. The large subject cohort to be used for these studies will allow us to further develop and validate this approach. Project Narrative. The proposed research is highly relevant to public health because the discovery of molecular mechanisms leading to cognitive decline and dementia in post-mortem human brain tissue of aged individuals, subjects with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and healthy donors will provide crucial insights into the pathophysiology of AD. This will provide conceptually new ways to think about the pathophysiology of this disorder and lead to novel preventive and therapeutic strategies. Thus, the project is relevant to the NIMH/NIA's mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the nature of mental disorders, and aging in particular as well as the application of that knowledge to cure and prevent mental health and aging-related disorders.",Role of the Extracellular Matrix in the Pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disorder: Regulation by OTX2,9718659,R01MH104488,"['Age

"Systematic Alzheimer's disease drug repositioning (SMART) based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening and image-omics PROJECT SUMMARY Given the complexity of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathogenesis and the associated co-morbid conditions, both the “depth” and the “width” of currently available drug repurposing solutions need to be improved in order to deliver effective AD therapeutic solutions. The depth of a drug-repurposing project refers to the level of understanding of disease mechanism and drug-target interactions across a wide searching space for the combination of dosage and treatment time. Achieving depth requires a reliable AD model system that comprehensively recapitulates AD pathogenesis in a human brain-like environment, and sophisticated transcriptomic profiles, which can reveal molecular-level changes underlying disease-reversing phenotypes across multiple treatment conditions. The width of a therapy search relies on the efficacy of predicting and validating effects of candidate compounds from an enormous search space. Width can be achieved from novel computational algorithms connecting –omics changes with phenotypic changes, thus guiding the search with improved knowledge on mechanisms and avoiding exhaustive testing of every available drug. Integrating the systems medicine and drug repositioning expertise of the Wong Lab at the Houston Methodist Research Institute of Houston Methodist Hospital with the Alzheimer's biology expertise of the Kim and Tanzi labs at Massachusetts General Hospital, we propose a SysteMatic Alzheimer's disease drug ReposiTioning (SMART) framework based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening. Reformatting a novel three- dimensional human neural stem cell culture model of AD (a.k.a. Alzheimer's in a dish) developed in the Kim and Tanzi labs for high content screening, the Wong lab screened 2,640 known drugs and bioactive compounds and obtained a panel of 38 primary hits that strongly inhibit β-amyloid-driven p-tau accumulation. We hypothesize that iteratively running relatively small screens with our novel 3D cell model and applying systematic artificial intelligence modeling to the transcriptomic profiles of the screening hits will allow us to: 1) quickly obtain a panel of robust novel drug candidates for AD, and 2) gain an in-depth understanding of disease mechanisms from those repositioned drug candidates, which will subsequently improve the success rate of predicting novel hits. Using the primary 38 hits as a starting point, the SMART computational modules will update the existing NeuriteIQ software package to quantify the image data from high content screening; it will also incorporate publicly available big data transcriptomic profiles to predict candidate compounds inducing similar pathway changes as those original compounds, effectively expanding the search width to tens of thousands of compounds while only requiring functional validation of less than 100 drug candidates. The validated predictions will, in turn, add to the panel of known hits that will launch the next round of computational predictions and experimental validations, efficiently generating candidates for novel AD therapies (Aim 1). SMART's iterative prediction-validation scheme effectively connects more transcriptomic profiles to desirable phenotypic changes. Thus, we will apply systematic image-omics modeling to uncover novel mechanisms driving such phenotypes. For all the validated hits, dose-responses for the phenotype of pTau inhibition will be obtained using the 3D culture model; while the dose-responses for individual genes and pathways will be modeled through public and in-house generated transcriptomic profiles. We will use Partial Least Square Regression models to identify gene modules with matching dose-response curves as the phenotypes, thus allowing us to go beyond the confinement of canonical pathway maps and identify novel functional modules specifically related to phenotypes of interest (Aim 2). Selected compounds derived from the previous two aims will be evaluated in human neurons directly derived from AD patients and in animal models (Aim 3). Success of this work will lead to new AD therapeutic compounds ready for translation into clinical trials, as well as a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the SMART framework for drug repositioning will be generalizable to other big data and disease platforms. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) Alzheimer's Disease (AD) currently afflicts 5.3 million people in the United States alone. Beyond symptomatic treatments, no clear therapeutic options are available. The proposed study provides a systematic drug repositioning strategy that uses a novel 3D human neural culture model (Alzheimer's-in-a-dish) integrated with a computational platform that leverages publicly available toxicology and pharmokinetic big data. Success of the study will greatly reduce the cost of AD drug development, identify potential new disease mechanism, and facilitate quicker translation from bench to bedside. .",Systematic Alzheimer's

"Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation Summary Transcription activation, a key step in gene control, is the readout of many signaling pathways controlling cell growth, development and stress response and defects in activation cause many human diseases and syndromes. Activation typically results from factors containing activation domains (ADs) binding to coactivator complexes containing activator binding domains (ABDs). Understanding the nature of ADs, the specificity of AD-coactivator interactions, and mechanisms of coactivator cooperativity are necessary for understanding the molecular basis of gene regulation. The long-term goal of this project is to determine mechanisms used by gene-specific activators and coactivators to regulate RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcription. The objectives of this proposal are to determine: i) mechanisms of Mediator recruitment and its interaction with ADs, ii) mechanisms of cooperativity between Mediator and the coactivator SAGA, and iii) what constitutes a functional AD and determines the AD specificity for different coactivators and promoter types. This work will utilize an interdisciplinary combination of biochemical, structural, molecular, and computational approaches to examine transcriptional activation in S. cerevisiae. To understand these mechanisms, we will build upon several breakthrough concepts and methods developed in the past grant period. We will use a combination of genomics and biochemistry to identify a new mechanism of Mediator recruitment that is likely used at many genes. We will use orthogonal approaches to determine how the coactivator SAGA stimulates genome-wide transcription, either by direct interaction with the Pol II preinitiation complex (PIC) and/or by direct interaction with Mediator. We will determine the structural basis for AD-Mediator Tail domain interaction using a combination of biochemical and structural analysis. Finally, we will use a combination of biochemistry, genomics, and computational analysis to predict AD function and specificity and identify new mechanisms of AD-coactivator interaction. The expected outcome of these studies will be a molecular understanding of transcription activator specificity and function, mechanisms used by the coactivators Mediator and SAGA to promote transcription, and an understanding of how these factors function at different classes of genes –a leap forward in understanding widely conserved mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation. Project Narrative Regulation of transcription by activation of gene expression is a key mechanism for control of cell growth, differentiation, and development. Defects in activation directly contribute to many human illnesses. Our proposed work will identify conserved and widely used mechanisms for transcriptional activation that will form the molecular basis for understanding regulation of transcriptional programs in normal cells, transcriptional defects leading to human disease, and reveal fundamental information on the mechanism of transcription factors that are the readout of many signaling pathways.",Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation,9613971,R01GM075114,"['Affect ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' cell growth ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA Polymerase II ', ' Pol II ', ' DNA-Dependent DNA Polymerase II ', ' DNA Polymerase epsilon ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Libraries ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Reagent ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' RNA Polymerase II ', ' RNA Polymerase B ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase II ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' S cerevisiae ', "" Brewer's Yeast "", "" Baker's Yeast "", ' Signal Pathway ', ' Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Syndrome ', ' Tail ', ' Technology ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' base ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Structure ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' Regulation ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' high throughput screening ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' Genomics ', ' Molecular Computations ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcription Initiation ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Normal Cell ', ' Housekeeping Gene ', ' Polymerase ', ' SAGA ', ' SPT/ADA/Gcn5 Acetyltransferase ', ' Transcription Coactivator ', ' transcriptional co-activator ', ' transcription co-activator ', ' Transcriptional Coactivator ', ' Transcriptional Activator/Coactivator ', ' Transcriptional Activator ', ' Transcription Factor Coactivator ', ' Transcription Activator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' DNA Binding Domain ', ' DNA-Binding Protein Motifs ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' in vivo ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Transcriptional Activation Domain ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' human disease ', ' protein crosslink ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' recruit ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,546403,0.0988206643151648
"Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease Resubmission 1 R01 AG058687-01 PI: Adriana Seelye, Ph.D. Project Summary. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease and their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and to reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. Project Objectives. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to objectively assess high-level IADL functioning in a new way that will more effectively identify the earliest subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence. The specific aims for this research are: Aim 1 will establish the most robust remotely monitored IADL variables and combinations of variables to discriminate between MCI and intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC using cross-sectional analyses. Aim 2 will determine the discriminatory ability of the new remotely monitored IADL variables compared to available IADL questionnaires to differentiate those with MCI relative to those with intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC in cross-sectional analyses. Aim 3 will identify and characterize the longitudinal trajectories (slopes) of remotely monitored IADL functioning over time between those with intact cognition and those with MCI using generalized linear mixed effects models, with person-specific IADL distributions and their changes as outcomes. Project Methods. The proposed project will apply innovative computing and ambient sensing technologies directly in participants' home and community environments to objectively assess IADL performance and variability among older adults with and without MCI in multiple clinically relevant functional domains for up to 4 years. Study involvement will also include annual neuropsychological and clinical testing. Machine learning computational approaches will be used to examine a large number of sensor-based IADL candidate variables generated through this study to determine the relative importance of these variables for discriminating between MCI and intact cognition groups, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Project Impact. The approaches used in this study will allow researchers, physicians, and caregivers to proactively identify and monitor increasing risks for deteriorating cognitive function (progressing from normal aging to MCI and from MCI to AD) in a way that is not currently possible, transforming AD prevention trials and significantly reducing the cost and consequences of functional decline in our aging population. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease, their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults with who are at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and the reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines.

"The study partner requirement in preclinical Alzheimers disease trials Project Summary/Abstract Preclinical Alzheimer's disease clinical trials enroll cognitively normal participants who are willing to undergo disease biomarker testing, learn the results, and take an investigational drug (or placebo) if those results indicate that they are at increased risk for disease. Like traditional trials in Alzheimer's disease dementia, these trials require participants to enroll with a study partner, a person who can attend visits with the participant and report about any changes in the participant's cognitive or functional ability. Like traditional trials in Alzheimer's disease dementia, these trials face logistical challenges related to difficult recruitment. We recently showed that the requirement for a participant to learn their Alzheimer's disease biomarker status was not a barrier to successful recruitment. In contrast, the requirement of enrolling with a study partner was a significant barrier to participation for many potential enrollees. We also observed results that suggested that the study partner barrier was related to the requirement of biomarker testing and disclosure. This project will further investigate the study partner role in preclinical Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. First, we will explore the ethical implications of the study partner requirement, specifically whether this requirement is a barrier to enrollment because participants are unwilling to share their biomarker results with others. Second, we examine the scientific need for study partners, by measuring informants' accuracy and precision in assessing cognitive performance, predicting cognitive decline, and recognizing subtle changes in cognition, and comparing to participants' abilities to perform these roles themselves. These studies will provide valuable data toward improving preclinical AD trial protocol designs, assisting investigators making decisions around 1) whether to require study partners, 2) who is qualified to fill this role, and 3) how participants should be protected against potential stigma related to their eligibility. Project Narrative Preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials enroll persons who have no observable cognitive impairment who demonstrate AD biomarkers and often face slow recruitment. This proposal will provide researchers with critical evidence to instruct recruitment that will increase the representativeness of preclinical AD trial subjects and ensure a complete understanding of the ethical issues in these trials, preventing a degradation of trust between researchers and participants and ensuring the safety of those who enroll.",The study partner requirement in preclinical Alzheimers disease trials,9564817,R21AG056931,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Affect ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Investigational Drugs ', ' Investigational New Drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Patients ', ' Placebos ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Trust ', ' Logistics ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Test Result ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Inferior ', ' Visit ', ' preference ', ' cooperative study ', ' Performance ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' data integrity ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' informant ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' eligible participant ', ' Alzheimer prevention ', ' AD prevention ', ' Alzheimer disease prevention ', ' alzheimer model ', ' AD model ', "" Alzheimer's disease model "", ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' Prevention trial ', ' cognitive ability ', ' trial design ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' pre-clinical trial ', ' preclinical trial ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R21,2018,183868,0.18202421870690524
"Longitudinal Analysis of the Dynamic Network Disruptions in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract A plethora of neuroscience studies has found that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) can be understood as a dysfunction syndrome where the structural and functional connectivity of the large-scale network are progressively disrupted by molecular pathomechanism that is not fully understood. The disruptions to the network exhibit dynamic patterns at different stages of AD, which holds valuable clues to understand AD progression. Current network computational tools are designed for cross-sectional data only, which is insufficient to maintain temporal consistency in investigating longitudinal network changes. To address this problem, we will develop the first extensive computational tool for longitudinal network analysis. Specifically, we will propose a learning-based approach to precisely quantify the evolution of brain network from noisy imaging data (Aim 1). Sparse representation and tensor analysis technique will be integrated to seek for the consistent longitudinal brain networks. We will apply our longitudinal network analysis tool to the series diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data from ADNI database to investigate how Alzheimer’s disease attacks human brain network by inspecting the dynamic interactions between the hub and non-hub nodes in AD progression (Aim 2). The outcome of this project will be the first longitudinal brain network analysis tool in computational neuroscience and neuroimaging fields. We will release the software (both binary program and source code), to facilitate the network studies in other neuro diseases that show brain network dysfunction. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a set of efficient computational tools specifically for longitudinal brain network analysis. In order to accurately measure the connectivity strength, we propose a learning-based approach to find the intrinsic brain network from the noisy imaging data. Sparse representation and tensor analysis technique have been integrated into brain network optimization for preserving the longitudinal consistency. It is worth noting that our data-driven approach is free of the ad-hoc thresholding technique which may undermine the repeatability of discovery. To the best of our knowledge, our learning-based approach is the first extensive computational tool for longitudinal network analysis in neuroscience and neuroimaging field. We will apply our longitudinal network analysis tools to the series diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data from ADNI database to investigate how Alzheimer’s disease attacks human brain network by inspecting the dynamic interactions between hub and non-hub nodes in AD progression.

"CSF, MRI, and PET biomarkers of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorder. Inflammatory changes in the brain are thought to represent key processes in the onset and progression of AD, but it remains unclear whether neuroinflammation confers neuroprotection, accelerated degeneration, or possibly both. Such an understanding in living humans is critical if we are to begin clinical trials using the array of FDA-approved immunomodulatory drugs in the future. We propose that complement- mediated neuroinflammation is protective in the early AD stages, while suppression of complement activities is accompanied by the development of greater cognitive deficits and faster cognitive decline. Our preliminary data from multiple cohorts support this hypothesis by showing 1) reduced levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) complement-related markers occur in the dementia stage but not mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of AD; 2) reduced CSF complement-related markers and elevated CSF interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels are associated with faster decline in AD; and 3) CSF inflammatory protein alterations reveal networks of cellular and protein regulations. In the In the current application, we will build on the association between complement related proteins and rates of cognitive decline in AD to identify associated changes in soluble CSF cytokines and chemokines, differential inflammatory cell type regulation, and imaging correlates of neuroinflammation. This application takes advantage of our group’s strengths in performing CSF cytokine measurements, CSF immunophenotyping, molecular imaging of neuroinflammation through positron emission tomography (PET) and iron-enhanced MRI, and network analysis through a novel biochemical-bioinformatics pipeline. We will directly identify individual and networks of soluble CSF cytokines that accompany the transition from the MCI to the dementia stage of AD, correlate the complement and other altered pathways with microglial activation through two modern PET tracers (11C-PBR28 and 18F-FEPPA), and measure changes in individual T helper cell (type 1, 2, 17) and non-T cell populations. This application represents the first attempt to correlate, at the individual level and at the group level, CSF and imaging measures of neuroinflammation. If successful, this application will advance the understanding of neuroinflammation in AD through parallel approaches, form the basis of a new biomarker panel (and algorithm) to diagnose AD through a combination of degenerative and inflammatory markers, and accelerate the target identification of future therapeutics aimed at modulating the immune system in AD. Brain inflammation is a key event in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease, but it is not clear whether it is harmful, protective, or both. The current proposal aims to confirm our finding that a switch from the protective to harmful type of inflammation predicts more severe symptoms and faster progression in Alzheimer’s disease, and we can identify people with the protective and harmful inflammation by studying the cerebrospinal fluid (circulating proteins and cells) and brain imaging (PET and MRI scans).","CSF, MRI, and PET biomarkers of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease",9511731,R01AG054046,"['Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Blood -

"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9543532,R01GM126550,"['Affect ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' anticancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Biology ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' Label ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' drug sensitivity ', ' Research Activity ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' brain cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' user friendly software ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' gene expression assay ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Skeleton ', ' Regulation ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' disorder subtype ', ' disease subtype ', ' disease subgroups ', ' technique development ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' patient population ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,400001,0.10631509493526464
"MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION FOR UNBIAS BIOMARKER DISCOVERY FOR AD AND OTHER COMPLEX TRAITS Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia but has no effective prevention or treatment. The brain proteome, ascertained in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have proven to be a rich source of information, reflecting Aβ plaques deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal injury and inflammation, and have helped the enrollment of participants in clinical trials. Still, additional non-invasive and cost-effective biomarkers are critical for the early detection, disease intervention and monitoring. Novel biomarkers may also help identify and characterize the additional aspects of AD, such as rate of progression and age at onset. Although genetic studies have focused on the identification of variants associated with risk through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome and exome sequencing projects, the genetic factors modulating these additional aspects of AD are less investigated. The current proposal focuses on these understudied aspects of disease etiology, namely the role of common and rare genetic variation on quantitative diagnostic and prognostic endophenotypes of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We will develop a unique resource – the proteome ascertained in a plasma, CSF and brain for a large number of samples – that will allow us to leverage unbiased approaches to reveal novel biomarkers and endophenotypes associated with AD and complex traits. We will utilize Mendelian Randomization to identify causal proteins involved in AD and extend our studies to other complex traits. We will use GWAS, exome-chip, whole-exome and whole-genome sequences to identify single variants, genes and pathways associated with plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain protein levels of AD biomarkers. NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with devastating personal, familial, societal and economical burdens, and there is currently no effective means of prevention or treatment.

"Quantifying Brain Abnormality by Multimodality Neuroimage Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops for an unknown and variable amount of time before its symptoms fully manifest. But, when the symptoms become clinically observable, a significant neurodegeneration has already taken place. Thus, there is a largely unmet need for technologies that can aid the effective early diagnosis and prognosis of AD in an in vivo and more objective manner. The goal of this renewal project is to develop a set of advanced machine-learning techniques for precise in vivo quantification of pathological changes of brains with multimodality neuroimaging for both early diagnosis and prognosis of AD. AD is a highly heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with complex pathophysiology, thus very challenging to pinpoint its subtle pathologies without any aid from advanced computational technologies. To this end, we propose the following four specific aims to identify those subtle disease-induced alterations, derive robust diagnostic conclusions, and predict future disease trajectories. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop a multi-view feature representation technique to robustly extract complementary information from neuroimaging data with multiple representative atlases, and then identify a small subset of most discriminative features for AD diagnosis. This novel multi-atlas technique will deviate from the conventional single-atlas approaches in feature representation, which are often susceptible to inter-subject structural variability, registration error, and atlas selection bias. In Aim 2, we will further devlop two novel multi-view feature mapping techniques for collaborative fusion of multimodality information by explicitly considering the distribution heterogeneity of different categories of features extracted from different modalities. This will significantly avoid the unnecessary complexity of feature distributions after our collaborative fusion, thus increasing the efficacy of subsequent diagnostic classifiers. Specifically, a deep learning technique (with deep multi-layered architecture) will be adopted to hierarchically mine multimodality information that resides nonlinearly both within each modality and between different modalities. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-task sparse learning technique for joint prediction of diagnostic status and clinical scores (e.g., ADAS-Cog and MMSE) by considering the inherent correlations between features and between training samples. This will also allow us to exploit the latent structure underlying the data for robust estimation of these highly variable clinical scores. Finally, in Aim 4, we will jointly predict clinical scores of each given subject in multiple future time points, by developing coupled random forests that can take advantage of all training subjects with complete or even incomplete multimodality data and further enforce temporal consistency of those estimated clinical scores.  All the above-proposed techniques will be evaluated by a large image set of elderly subjects in ADNI. We expect that the successful completion of this renewal project will result in a comprehensive and effective diagnosis/prognosis framework for improving early detection of AD. The respective software tools will be released freely to the research community, as we have done with our HAMMER software, which has been downloaded by >5200 users from >20 countries.

"Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Dynamic High-Order Brain Networks Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Dynamic High- Order Brain Networks Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with no known disease-modifying treatment. Current clinical diagnosis and monitoring of the disease are primarily based on subjective neuropsychological and neurobehavioral assessments, which are generally susceptible to large variability. Objective biomarkers that are sufficiently sensitive and specific for diagnosis and monitoring purposes are hence critically in need. Neuroimaging fits this need and provides objective measures and markers of preclinical disease states for aiding researchers and clinicians in developing new treatments and monitoring their effectiveness. Since AD- related neurological degeneration occurs long before the appearance of clinical symptomatology, additional diagnostic information during the prodromal phase of AD, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is of paramount importance for the success of treatment. The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning diagnostic framework based on resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) for accurate AD diagnosis at the individual level, so as to promote early detection for possible treatment and prophylaxis. Achieving this goal requires significant technical innovations to empower researchers the ability to detect sophisticated yet subtle alteration patterns in brain function. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts in accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will harness the temporal dynamics of functional connectivity to provide additional information for accurate identification of individuals who are at risk for AD. This is significantly different from most existing methods that assume temporal stationarity and are therefore unable to take advantage of temporally-evolving connectivity information for more fine-grained characterization of rapidly changing brain states. In Aim 2, we will extract high-order information from functional networks, beyond the commonly used region-pair correlation, for characterizing functional synchronization of the interactions of multiple pairs of regions. This overcomes the over-simplistic pairwise-interaction assumptions of existing methods, and thus allows greater capacity to model complex brain circuitry. In Aim 3, we will fuse information across imaging modalities to complement functional networks with both the white-matter structural networks (generated using diffusion MRI) and the morphological networks (generated using cortical thickness information from anatomical T1-weighted imaging). This will allow complementary information from different modalities to reinforce each other in improving diagnostic accuracy. Upon successful completion of this project, we expect that the resulting comprehensive, integrated, and effective diagnosis framework will be conducive to improving the success of early detection of MCI/AD, as well as other neurological disorders including schizophrenia, autism, and multiple sclerosis.

"Di-Leu-enabled multiplexed quantitation for biomarker discovery and validation in Alzheimer's disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly population. While several peptide and protein biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been used for AD diagnosis, an unequivocal diagnosis in the early phases of AD is still lacking. Perhaps more importantly, the discovery and establishment of reliable biomarkers capable of monitoring progression and degree of cognitive impairment as well as potential efficacy of therapy remains a major challenge. Furthermore, the correlation between CSF protein/peptide biomarkers and changes in the brain structure/function and cognition is not well established. In order to address these challenges and fill in existing knowledge gaps, we propose to employ a multi-faceted approach combining a suite of mass spectrometry-based technologies enabled by innovative multiplexed tagging strategies, bioinformatics tools and clinically-available measures to discover, identify and evaluate potential biomarkers of AD in CSF obtained from asymptomatic cognitively-healthy middle-aged adults, older cognitively-normal adults, and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. We propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 – To conduct in-depth analysis of site-specific glycoproteome and endogenous glycopeptidome in CSF from subjects in control, preclinical, MCI, AD groups, respectively. Specific Aim 2 – To discover and identify a panel of candidate glycoprotein/glycopeptide biomarkers at different stages of AD using multiplexed dimethylated leucine (DiLeu) reagents-enabled quantitative glycoproteomics approach along with machine learning classification algorithms for improved diagnosis of AD. Specific Aim 3 – To validate the CSF AD biomarkers, in plasma samples collected from individuals with MCI and dementia, using targeted quantitative proteomics approaches and ELISA assay along with association with AD-related clinical, cognitive and neuroimaging measures. This project uniquely integrates advances in MS-based multiplexed quantitative glycoproteomics and bioinformatics tools with neuroimaging and clinical measures to enable more comprehensive discovery and validation of CSF biomarkers in AD.  The proposed research will be performed in collaboration with a multi-disciplinary team of investigators including Drs. Cynthia Carlsson, Henrik Zetterberg, Ozioma Okonkwo and David Page. This multifaceted approach will enable identification of biomarkers of AD in CSF that offer improved sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis and predict dementia onset and progression. These biomarkers would be invaluable in designing therapeutics for patient care and more efficient clinical trials of disease modifying therapies. The advances in technology and new insights will have broad impact on translational medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly population, affecting more than 5 million Americans and 15 million people worldwide. The development of effective disease-modifying therapeutics for AD would greatly benefit from in vivo biomarkers, preferentially those that tag the very earliest stages of the disease. It is critical to establish a panel of valid biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring its progression, or even prevent it by targeting several pharmaceutical candidates. Despite several existing biomarkers for AD, they do not capture the heterogeneity of the disease and more importantly, lack the sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis. To address this key challenge and knowledge gap, this proposal aims to develop an innovative multi-faceted approach enabled by ultraplexed protein quantitation technology and new advancements of MS instrumentation allowing in-depth site-specific glycoproteomic mapping coupled with advanced bioinformatics tools and clinical neuroimaging for novel AD biomarker discovery and validation. The successful outcome of this research will have broad impact on translational medicine and will have profound impact on the physical and emotional health of millinois of individual patients at risk for this devastating diease.",Di-Leu-enabled multiplexed quantitation for biomarker discovery and validation in Alzheimer's disease,9449167,RF1AG052324,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', '

"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia ABSTRACT The “preclinical” phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation in the absence of major symptoms, can last decades, and potentially holds the key to successful therapeutic strategies. Today there is an urgent need for quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests that can predict clinical progression at the individual level. This project will develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms that will mine high dimensional, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to derive models that yield individual-level clinical predictions in the context of dementia. The developed prognostic models will specifically utilize ubiquitous and affordable data types: structural brain MRI scans, saliva or blood-derived genome-wide sequence data, and demographic variables (age, education, and sex). Prior research has demonstrated that all these variables are strongly associated with clinical decline to dementia, however to date we have no model that can harvest all the predictive information embedded in these high dimensional data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to compute clinical predictions from high- dimensional biomedical data such as clinical scans. Yet, most prior ML methods were developed for applications where the ``prediction’’ task was about concurrent condition (e.g., discriminate cases and controls); and established risk factors (e.g., age), multiple modalities (e.g., genotype and images) and longitudinal data were not fully exploited. This application’s core innovation will be to develop rigorous, flexible, and practical ML methods that can fully exploit multi-modal, longitudinal, and high- dimensional biomedical data to compute prognostic clinical predictions. The proposed project will build on the PI’s strong background in computational modeling and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. We will employ an innovative Bayesian ML framework that offers the flexibility to handle and exploit real-life longitudinal and multi-modal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternative benchmarks for identifying preclinical individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a statistically rigorous approach for discovery, cross-validation, and benchmarking the developed tools. This project will yield freely distributed, documented, and validated software and models for predicting future clinical progression based on whole-genome, longitudinal structural MRI and demographic data. We believe the algorithms and software we develop will yield invaluable tools for stratifying preclinical AD subjects in drug trials, optimizing future therapies, and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. NARRATIVE Emerging technologies allow us to identify clinically healthy subjects harboring Alzheimer’s pathology. While many of these preclinical individuals progress to dementia, sometimes quite quickly, others remain asymptomatic for decades. The proposed project will develop sophisticated data mining algorithms to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on ubiquitous, easy- to-collect, and affordable data modalities: brain MRI scans, saliva or blood- derived whole-genome sequences, and clinical and demographic variables.","Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and

"Brain-Computer Interface to Enhance Attention in Alzheimers Disease Summary  This administrative supplement proposes to add a group of adults with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) to the parent award R01DC009834. We will implement the same experimental methods that were approved in Specific Aims 2 and 4 of the parent award with this additional clinical population. The outcome measure of changes in Information Transfer Rate (ITR) as a result of training remains the same and we are adding two secondary behavioral measures for reading skills that were approved by the NIDCD program officer.  Individuals with AD present with attention and language deficits secondary to their dementia syndrome. Reading impairments are typical, and affect daily activities ranging from reading text (such as menus or magazines) to reading salient cues in their environment for wayfinding. The supplement goal is to enhance attention and reading skills in people with mild AD through a visual-attention-to-letters training paradigm. The training uses a letter-based brain-computer interface (BCI), the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) Keyboard system, which was already established in the parent award. It displays letters while EEG is recorded and uses a machine learning classifier and language model to decide the user's intended letter.  It is proposed that BCI training improves attention and fundamental reading skills in adults with mild AD. We plan to recruit 24 participants with possible or probable AD and language impairment from the NIA-funded P30 Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Center of which Barry Oken, MD, PhD is associate director. AD Center recruitment ensures all participants are diagnosed and characterized using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center guidelines. Participants will present with a Global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5 – 1 and deficits in reading, and will pass an established cognitive screen for RSVP Keyboard BCI use. Participants enroll in a single arm intervention with multiple baseline A-B design and outcomes measures obtained 3 times before and 3 times after intervention in a 2-month period. Two training opportunities are planned. First, participants perform a BCI RSVP calibration task twice weekly for 6 weeks. Feedback about attention and intended letter selection accuracy are provided based on P300 waves. Second, participants view a simulated RSVP Keyboard for 15 minutes daily on home computers as a process-specific attention training task. Three outcome measures are: (1) ITR, an EEG (P300) measure related to attention; (2) sentence reading fluency; and (3) letter-word identification. Reading skills are assessed with standardized, valid subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson IV Tests of Achievement. It is hypothesized that ITR, reading fluency and letter-word identification skills are improved with the training. This supplement strengthens the current assistive technology research program and provides data for a larger research agenda on translational BCI skills and training paradigms for individuals with cognitive and motor impairments, including those with AD. Project Narrative It is estimated that 5.7 whom million Americans of all ages are living with Alzheimer's dementia in 2018, many of can benefit frominterventions to improve attention and letter reading abilities. The RSVP Keyboard Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) provides automated training to improve cognitive skills and addresses vigilance to letters so individuals can rely on reading and greater attention to text for daily activities and wayfinding so that individuals can remain active in their communities.

"Computational Prediction and Functional Validation of Novel Risk Loci of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the United States but has no disease-modifying treatments. AD is also a substantially genetically based disease. Despite the fact that tens of new loci have been uncovered by GWAS to be AD-associated, the majority of the genetic component of AD remains unexplained. We propose an innovative machine learning computational approach to discover new AD genetic loci that leverages the tremendous investment in AD research including the following projects: Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD), and the Molecular Mechanisms of the Vascular Etiology of Alzheimer’s Disease (M²OVE-AD). We propose to use machine learning classification models trained on existing AD genetic studies and publicly available, multi-omics data to generate an AD-specific “risk score” for each base in the genome. To test these models, we propose a 2-stage (discovery/replication) study using a unique dataset of human postmortem brains from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Religious Orders Study (ROS). Simultaneously, we propose functional studies in model systems to determine whether the selective identified loci could influence AD pathogenesis.  In Aim 1, we propose to build machine learning models and using the models to obtain genome-wide, AD-specific “risk scores.” These scores will identify novel loci in the genome that increase AD risk were a mutation to be present there. In Aim 2, we propose to test our models using a unique dataset of 1695 human postmortem brains from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Religious Orders Study (ROS). These prospective longitudinal studies annually collect data cognitive, mental, and physical health, and has the requisite available tissue and data from genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dPFC). We propose a 2-stage genetic study to validate genetic associations with AD by testing whether rare variants in the locus associate with AD or whether there is differential CpG methylation at the locus associated with AD. In Aim 3, we will examine the functional consequences of top AD-associated “risk scores” in relevant model systems, including fly, mammalian cell culture and mouse models of AD.  This project can potentially identify important molecular contributors of AD that might not be apparent through other approaches, leading to new insights into mechanisms and treatment targets for AD and thereby have an important and sustained impact on public health. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects 5.4 million people in the U.S and is the 6th leading cause of death. AD is a substantially genetically based disease, and our proposal aims to find new genetic causes of AD by employing cutting-edge computational approaches, followed by experimental validation. Discovery of new genetic causes of AD will: 1) shed light on new biological mechanisms, 2) facilitate development of new diagnostic tests, and 3) provide new targets for AD treatment.",Computational

"Cognitive heterogeneity in those with high Alzheimer's Disease Risk The lack of an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has led to a call to detect the disease earlier in its course but AD's insidious onset that can span many years, adds complexity to doing so. As a result, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) has identified to understand the heterogeneity of AD, particularly at the asymptomatic stages as a research priority. While there are well-documented high AD risk factors (e.g., age, apolipoprotein E4, cardiovascular risk, amyloid and tau pathology), diagnosis is not inevitable, but it remains unknown why only some of those with high AD risk progress to disease and others do not. We contend that one challenge for answering this question is that by the time traditional AD preclinical symptoms of memory decline and/or hippocampal atrophy emerge, the neurodegenerative trajectory is already on a near irreversible course. We further hypothesize that traditional measurement methods produce crude measures that mask the broader range of clinical expression in the preclinical period and preclude the earliest opportunity to detect the beginning of the neurodegenerative trajectory. In this application, we seek to leverage the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) cognitive aging and dementia database, acquired through nearly 7 decades of prospective examination. Unique to FHS since 2005 has been the collection of novel NP indices (error responses, digital metrics such as item-level latencies, fragmented responses). Baseline data were collected at a time when the vast majority of these participants appeared asymptomatic, including those who are at high AD risk, a subset of which have since progressed to incident AD as well as similarly high AD risk subgroups who did not. We will use this unprecedented resource to 1) characterize the cognitive heterogeneity of these high AD risk groups as they do and do not progress to disease, 2) determine whether traditional neuroimaging biomarkers differentiate between progressors and non-progressors and 3) develop novel machine learning methods to identify neuroimaging indices even earlier than traditional MRI measures. We predict that compared to traditional neuropsychological (NP) scores, our novel NP measures will produce unique cognitive profiles that better differentiate those at high AD risk who do and do not progress to AD, that the NP profiles of high AD risk progressors will be associated with AD neuroimaging markers (e.g. decline in total brain and hippocampal volume, increase in white matter hyperintensities) while the NP profiles of high AD risk non-progressors will not show similar evidence of brain structure changes. We will also develop an adversarial learning framework to enhance baseline MRI images to serve as better predictors of high AD risk progressor and non-progressor groups than the original images. Results will lead to identification of a broader spectrum of preclinical presentation in those with high AD risk than has been previously recognized and thus better characterize the heterogeneity of NP performance, particularly earlier in the disease course, potentially identifying a critical period in which intervention strategies can mitigate disease risk. This study seeks to characterize the heterogeneity of cognitive profiles among those who are at high risk for Alzheimer's disease and differentiate those who do go on to disease and those who do not. This study is enhanced by novel cognitive data that include digital metrics that permit more extensive characterization of unique cognitive profiles in these high risk groups.",Cognitive heterogeneity

"Phenotypic screening and computational modeling for development of combination therapies for Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is thought to affect 40 million patients worldwide, a likely underestimate given the increasing recognition that the disease begins in the brain 2-3 decades before clinical symptoms are manifest. With an aging population and the staggering economic and emotional burden of patient care, the demand for effective AD therapies continues to grow. Beta amyloid (Aβ) peptides are thought to be the initial trigger for neurotoxic sequelae that in turn define AD progression; however, the recent clinical failures of a number of investigational drugs aimed at either preventing the production and/or aggregation of Aβ or enhancing its clearance have highlighted the need to gain a more holistic understanding of the temporal and spatial complexity intrinsic to AD pathophysiology. The pleiotropic effects attributed to Aβ are a challenge for developing pharmaceutical interventions against neuronal toxicity in AD. In this project, we propose merging phenotypic screening with computational inference to deconstruct Aβ-induced toxicities into targetable and interacting pathogenic and protective pathways. Our approach iterates experiments with computational modeling and analysis to efficiently identify drug combinations that protect against Aβ-induced toxicity in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived AD cell models. We have two specific aims: The first aim is to identify FDA approved drugs that prevent death in iPSC-derived neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) treated with Aβ, and then find combinations of these drugs that will synergistically combine to protect cells. Our second aim is to find combinations of approved drugs that target different pathways involved in Aβ-mediated cell death; here, the drugs considered need not individually demonstrate measurable protection against Aβ cell death, but we will computationally identify combinations that provide protection. In both aims, hits will be found through cell-based phenotypic screening, and combinations will be predicted using orthogonal computational models, including existing models, novel methods that incorporate drug-target interaction information, and deep learning. We design our study to simultaneously minimize the number of screens required to identify effective combinations, maximize the efficacy of the optimal combinations, and maximize the gain in information about the cellular effects of Aβ. This project will not only generate novel combinations of FDA approved drugs that slow Aβ-related cell death in human NPCs, but it will also deepen our understanding of the systems biology of AD pathogenesis, opening the door for development of new therapeutic strategies. At the end of the project, we expect to have several combinations of approved drugs poised for in vivo or clinical testing, as well as a list of pathways that are central to protection of neuronal cells in AD. Project Narrative The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is increasing with an aging population, mounting a staggering economic and emotional burden of patient care, and driving the demand for effective AD therapies. This project combines computational modeling with cell-based phenotypic screening to identify approved drugs or combinations of approved drugs for protecting human neuronal cells against cell death downstream of oligomeric beta amyloid insult. The expected outcome is a set of combinations treatments that show neuroprotection in vitro and can readily be advanced to pre-clinical or clinical trials.",Phenotypic screening and computational

"Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Adults with Down Syndrome Abstract By age 40 years, individuals with Down syndrome (DS) show the neuropathological changes of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and have a high risk for dementia, but little is known about the biomarkers that may predict clinical onset or reflect disease progression. The ABC-DS study focuses on a longitudinal and multidisciplinary determination of key biomarkers that are likely to define this progression, including levels and rates of change in blood based biomarkers such as b-amyloid peptides, protein and lipid profiles, and measures of amyloid and tau concentration in cerebrospinal fluid, neuroimaging-based changes and genetic polymorphisms. Using a neurocognitive battery that we have developed and tested, systematic profiles of longitudinal stability and of decline will allow us to define dementia status, including Mild Cognitive Impairment in DS (MCI-DS), and characterize progression in clinical status. Previously generated protein, inflammatory and lipid signatures will be examined, as well as amyloid and tau profiles in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Imaging biomarkers will include structural MRI components and PET studies of brain amyloid uptake and tau protein. Analysis of MRI imaging biomarkers will include longitudinal measures of atrophy, white matter abnormalities and intrinsic network connectivity paradigms. Amyloid positron tomography will delineate regional and whole brain uptake of amyloid and tau deposition. Polymorphisms in candidate genes for AD and related biomarkers will be studied as potential modifiers of risk and their relation to beta amyloid, proteomic, lipidomic and imaging biomarkers examined. Relationships among demographic, clinical, blood based and CSF biomarkers, imaging measures, and genetic variants will be examined to develop the most valid indicators of preclinical and early stages of AD. The addition of non-targeted proteomics (n=7,000 proteins) will provide the single largest and richest dataset to date for the study of AD in adults with DS The identification of a blood-based profile that can be highly accurate in identifying people at risk and in screening out people who have a low likelihood of having cerebral amyloid and/or tau would be of tremendous value to novel clinical trials an approach has tremendous potential for revolutionizing the current system. Importantly, the data and the biological samples will be archived and banked to establish a resource to be shared with other scientists. Collectively, our investigators have a combined clinical and research experience involving over 1500 patients (30% demented), over 850 banked blood samples, 500 DNA samples, and 50 imaging studies. Further, team investigators have previous experience with all methods that will be included in this new project. This proposal brings together a group of co-investigator with established expertise in studies of DS and makes available a combined cohort of 400 participants. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) Individuals with Down syndrome have a high risk for Alzheimer's disease, but little is known about the biomarkers that characterize disease onset and progression or why some individuals develop dementia much earlier than others. This study focuses on a multidisciplinary determination of key risk as well as protective biomarkers that are likely to affect AD progression, including blood-based, CSF-based and imaging-based biomarkers, and polymorphisms in AD-related genes. Study of biomarkers for early dementia changes may yield critical data documenting the transition from normal aging to mild cognitive impairment to clinical dementia in individuals with DS. This can provide key insights into the pathways involved in AD progression and may allow for future therapeutic interventions before irreversible cognitive deterioration has occurred.",Biomarkers of

"Mechanisms of Age-related Cognitive Decline in the Rhesus Monkey During normal aging, pyramidal cells in the primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) undergo significant structural and functional changes associated with cognitive deficits. Pyramidal cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) are comparatively spared. The parent project of this Supplement (R01 AG059028) analyzes the selective vulnerability of neurons and associated networks in LPFC compared to V1 in aging rhesus monkeys, and the role of age-related increases in oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular dysfunction in high-susceptibility LPFC neurons. We also propose that curcumin, an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory polyphenol, ameliorates age-related molecular, structural, and behavioral changes. We use a unique combination of state-of-the art physiological, anatomical and computational approaches, and behavioral assessment of aging monkeys, under control conditions and following therapeutic treatment with curcumin. This Supplement application (PA-18-591) represents a logical extension of this work to the human brain by assessing cellular alterations and neuronal demise in postmortem brains from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) compared to neurotypical control individuals. We focus on subsets of large pyramidal neurons severely and preferentially vulnerable in AD, identifiable by a high content of dephosphorylated neurofilament proteins and located in deep layer 3 and layer 5 in primates. Our previous analyses revealed that these neurons undergo tangle formation in early stages of AD at a faster rate than other pyramidal cells. We will use the same highly multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence platform together with rigorous stereologic designs to analyze the molecular phenotype of these neurons in AD cases with early (Clinical Dementia Scores [CDR] 0.5) and definite (CDR 3) dementia compared to controls (CDR 0). We will characterize in detail the protein expression profiles of neocortical neuron subsets in the normally aging human brain and through AD progression by imaging on the same tissue section large numbers of biomarkers, enabling classification of cell types and states on a cell-by-cell basis. Data-driven machine-learning techniques will be applied to assign neuronal subclasses based on molecular phenotype. We will analyze areas 9/46 (LPFC), which is affected in AD, and 17 (V1), which is generally spared in AD, replicating the experimental design of the parent project. Using many molecular markers from the parent project, we will study the microenvironment of vulnerable and non-vulnerable neurons, including glial and vascular cells, and extracellular pathology, at a layer-level of resolution. We expect to uncover potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets that could ultimately provide new approaches for earlier disease detection and prevention of progressive loss of critical neurons in AD. This Supplement and its parent project will yield novel and key information on the neural substrates of cognitive decline in aging primates and provide insight into specific mechanisms of action of protective anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidants in normal and pathological brain aging. Narrative from Parent R01 The goal of this study is to characterize the changes that occur to neurons, glia and vasculature in the prefrontal cortex and visual cortex during normal aging in the rhesus monkey in order to gain insight into the neural substrates of age-related cognitive decline in the primate. Importantly we will also test the ability of curcumin, a very powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, to prevent significant age-related changes to the brain. This study will thus reveal mechanisms underlying age-related brain dysfunction and suggest mechanisms that can compensate for changes to restore cellular function, and thus has broad implications for therapeutic strategies to reduce cognitive decline during normal aging, an important goal given our aging population.",Mechanisms of Age-related Cognitive Decline in the Rhesus

"An Integrated Reverse Engineering Approach Toward Rapid drug Re positioning for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and one of the leading sources of morbidity and mortality in the aging population. Despite enormous social and economic costs associated with AD, current drugs are directed towards symptomatic relief and none are curative. In this project titled “An integrated reverse engineering approach toward rapid drug repositioning for Alzheimer’s disease,” we propose to develop an innovative integrated drug repositioning strategy that combines computation-based drug prediction, computation-based human brain-blood-barrier (BBB) permeability prediction, retrospective large-scale clinical corroboration, and prospective experimental testing to rapidly identify anti-AD drug candidates. First, we will develop novel computational approaches to identify repositioning anti-AD candidates from all (>2,600) FDA-approved drugs. Second, we will develop novel multifaceted biology-based computational methods to predict which repositioned drug candidates can cross BBB in humans. Third, we will perform large-scale retrospective case-control studies to corroborate the clinical efficacy of repositioned drug candidates using patient electronic health record (EHR) data of >50 million patients. Finally, we will evaluate the therapeutic potential of promising repositioned candidates in experimental models. Our study will generate a large amount of data/knowledge/hypotheses that could serve as a starting point for us and others to conduct hypothesis-driven drug repositioning studies in other animal models of AD and in AD patients. We will build a comprehensive Alzheimer Drug Repositioning Knowledge Base (ADRKB) and develop interactive web applications to make ADRKB publicly available. The unique and powerful strength of our project is our ability to seamlessly combine novel computational predictions, retrospective clinical corroboration using patient EHRs, and experimental testing in animal models of AD to rapidly identify innovative drug candidates that may work in real-world AD patients. The repositioned drug candidates will have interpretable mechanisms of action, are highly likely to cross BBB in humans, have clinical effectiveness evidence gathered from ‘real-world’ AD patients, and have demonstrated efficacy in mouse models of AD. We anticipate that these findings can be expeditiously translated into clinical trials and benefit 5.4 million AD patients in United States and 47 million AD patients worldwide. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes enormous personal and societal burdens. Currently there exist no cures for AD. In this project titled “An integrated reverse engineering approach toward rapid drug repositioning for Alzheimer’s disease,” we propose to develop an innovative integrated drug repositioning strategy that combines novel computational drug prediction, novel computational brain-blood-barrier (BBB) permeability prediction, retrospective large-scale clinical corroboration, and prospective experimental testing to rapidly identify repositioned anti-AD drug candidates. The output of our project will be a list of ranked repositioned drug candidates with interpretable mechanisms of action, high BBB permeability in humans, supporting clinical efficacy evidence gathered from ‘real-world’ AD patients, and demonstrated efficacy in mouse models of AD. We anticipate that these findings can be expeditiously translated into clinical trials and benefit AD patients. Our study will generate a large amount of data/knowledge/hypotheses that could serve as a starting point for others to conduct hypothesis- driven biomedical and clinical drug repositioning studies in different animal models of AD and in patients.",An Integrated Reverse Engineering Approach Toward Rapid drug Re positioning for Alzheimer's Disease,9566845,R01AG057557,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Animals ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Amyloid deposition ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Engineering ', ' Genes ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Patients ', ' Permeability ', ' Phenotype ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Adverse drug effect ', ' Drug Side Effects ', ' Work ', ' tau Proteins ', ' τ Proteins ', ' tau factor ', ' tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' Experimental Models ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' drug efficacy ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Provider ', ' therapeutic evaluation ', ' therapeutic testing ', ' Data ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' disease phenotype ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' alzheimer model ', ' AD model ', "" Alzheimer's disease model "", ' neurodegenerative phenotype ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' FDA approved ', ' phenomics ', ' drug candidate ', ' web application ', ' web app ', ' ']",NIA,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,534336,0.3312690455442929
"Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS) Project Summary While the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increases with advancing age, approximately 5% of AD patients develop symptoms before age 65 (~280,000 Americans). The vast majority (90%-95%) of EOAD patients do not have a known mutation in APP or PSEN1/2, and only ~50% are APOE4 carriers. Unlike late-onset AD (LOAD), 30-64% of EOAD have non-amnestic presentations, leading to missed or delayed diagnosis. Despite being highly motivated and having few comorbidities, EOAD patients are commonly excluded from large scale observational biomarker studies (e.g. ADNI and DIAN) and therapeutic trials due to their young age, non- amnestic deficits, or absence of known pathogenic mutations. Furthermore, studies suggest high heritability in EOAD in the absence of known mutations or APOE4, signifying that this population may be enriched for novel genetic risk factors. Emerging biomarkers of amyloid and tau have not been systematically characterized in this population. Clinical and neuroimaging measures employed in LOAD may be insensitive to baseline deficits and disease progression in EOAD, which predominantly involve non-memory cognitive domains and posterior cortical neurodegeneration. To fill this gap in AD research, we plan to recruit and longitudinally follow 400 amyloid PET- positive EOAD subjects meeting NIA-AA criteria for MCI due to AD or probable AD dementia (including primary amnestic, dysexecutive, language and visuospatial presentations) and 100 age-matched controls. Participants in the Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease Study (LEADS) will undergo clinical assessments, psychometric testing, MRI, amyloid ([18F]Florbetaben) and tau ([18F]AV1451) PET, CSF and blood draw for collection of DNA, RNA, plasma, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Patients will be assessed at three time points – baseline (both EOAD and controls), 12 months (EOAD all measures; controls – clinical and cognitive measures only) and 24 months (EOAD, all measures except PET). Methods will be harmonized with ADNI and DIAN. We will comprehensively characterize cognitive, imaging and biofluid changes over time in EOAD, and compare to a matched sample of LOAD participants identified in ADNI. We will employ machine learning algorithms to develop sensitive clinical and imaging measures of EOAD progression. An exploratory aim will apply next generation sequencing to assess for novel genetic risk factors for disease. The study will also establish a network of EOAD research sites and set the stage for the launch of clinical trials in this population. Project Narrative Patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD), occurring before age 65, are an understudied segment of the population of patients with AD, and many treatment studies exclude these younger individuals. In this project, we plan to recruit and follow more than 400 people with EOAD in order to better understand changes in thinking abilities, changes in the brain, and changes in blood and spinal fluid, with the goal of using this information to design new treatment trials inclusive of this segment of the AD population.",Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS),9568150,U01AG057195,"['Age ',

"Alzheimer's Amyloid and Tau Pathology Staging and Clinical Impact Prediction Using Multi-Modal MRI Pattern Classification SUMMARY This Phase I grant will use innovative machine learning approaches and brain image data to address the critical need to identify the presence and extent of Alzheimer’s disease pathology for clinical diagnosis and treatment evaluation. Misdiagnosis rates currently exceed 20% and diagnosis is not available in early stages of disease, impeding patient care and the development of effective treatments. Combining innovations in machine learning with recently available information from tau PET imaging, classifier and regression models will be developed that can predict amyloid plaque and tau distribution, using structural and/or functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. These advances can greatly improve the early, accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, enable the selection of patients for clinical trials, and aid in the development of effective new therapeutics. In the first Specific Aim, multivariate machine learning classifiers will be developed using structural MRI, functional MRI (ASL), and FDG PET as a comparator to characterize amyloid and tau pathology and disease stage in patients with Alzheimer’s disease ranging from presymptomatic through dementia stages. Second, within-classifier and across-classifier performance will be evaluated with respect to the objectives to: discriminate subjects with amyloid and tau pathology; provide a metric of tau burden and spatial distribution using MRI and FDG PET modalities; and identify neurodegenerative patterns that may reflect differences in clinical severity among patients with the same tau burden and distribution. In addition, the relationship between classifier scores and cognitive endpoints will be evaluated. Third, similar classifiers will be developed using structural MRI and FDG PET to characterize amyloid and CSF tau burden in a genetically predisposed, early onset AD population, and findings compared to those in the late onset AD population. This work makes use of data acquired in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the DIAN study of early onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s Disease (ADAD), and additional data sets. Innovations of this work include: prediction of tau burden and distribution using imaging measures of neurodegeneration; application of our machine learning methods and optimization to recently available modalities and measures; unique approaches in machine learning optimization and classifier design; and the inclusion of Late Onset Alzheimer’s Disease (LOAD) and ADAD data sets and initial comparison between these forms of AD. Achievement of these aims will result in diagnostic and prognostic image analysis tools to aid in accurate diagnosis and prognosis supporting patient care and the clinical evaluation of therapeutic interventions. NARRATIVE! This Phase I grant uses innovative machine learning approaches and brain image data to address the critical need to diagnose the presence and extent of Alzheimer’s disease pathology for clinical diagnosis and treatment evaluation. Using sophisticated software tools, algorithms will be developed that can predict the amount of amyloid plaque and the distribution of aggregated tau, two hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that is widely used in clinical trials and in the clinic. These advances can greatly improve the early, accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, enable the selection of patients for clinical trials, and aid in the development of urgently needed effective

"Development of Ryan Companion Robot for Assisting Elderly People with Alzheimer's Disease The objective of the proposed Fast-Track SBIR effort is to develop and commercialize the Ryan CompanionBot (hereafter, Ryan), an intelligent conversational life-like social robot, designed to improve the well-being and quality of life of older adults with early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementia (ADRD). According to the NIA, research reports estimate that as many as 5.1 million Americans may have AD, and the number is expected to rise as the population ages. Common symptoms of AD/ADRD include cognitive decline, short-term memory loss, changes in mood, depression, communication difficulties, lost interest in hobbies or activities, and repetitive behavior. Americans suffering from AD/ADRD are believed to cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Traditional methods for disease management have shown limited success treating AD/ADRD or mitigating its symptoms. Health care personnel and caregivers who are physically and emotionally taxed are seeking new ways to provide care for elderly individuals and particularly those suffering from AD/ADRD. Innovative technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, have begun to alleviate the growing need for novel solutions to the healthcare. Among such technologies, socially assistive robots such as Ryan have received a great amount of attention in recent years. Ryan will be designed to promote social interaction and foster engagement and rapport, and improve mood and well-being of persons with early stage AD/ADRD. In the Phase I effort, we will develop facial emotion recognition technology and integrate it with Ryan and then conduct a pilot study to understand the feasiblity and effectiveness of Ryan in fostering empathy and rapport in interaction with persons with AD/ADRD. Once validated, we will work with domain experts to design and build aestehcically pleasing Ryan V2.0 and integrate the facial expression recognition technology with a spoken- dialog system, reminders, and other intelligent features into Ryan to address the needs of persons with early stage AD/ADRD and their caregivers. If successful, DreamFace will be positioned to bring to market an affordable and effective socially-assistive robot to improve the quality of life for persons with AD/ADRD. The goal of the project is to develop a socially assistive robot companionbot (Ryan) for improving the quality of life of persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Americans suffering from AD cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Successful development of Ryan will improve patient well-being, make caregivers more efficient and effective, and provide significant financial benefits to the healthcare industry, and assist families

"Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex Humans have a remarkable ability to flexibly interact with the environment. A compelling demonstration of this cognitive flexibility is our ability to perform complex, yet previously un-practiced tasks successfully on the first attempt. We refer to this ability as `ad hoc self-programming': `ad hoc' because these new behavioral repertoires are cobbled together on the fly, based on immediate demand, and then discarded when no longer necessary; `self-programming' because the brain has to configure itself appropriately based on task demands and some combination of prior experience and/or instruction. This type of learning differs importantly from trial-and-error learning, in which responses are sculpted incrementally, based on feedback from previous attempts. In comparison to trial-and-error learning, much less is known about ad hoc self- programmed learning, but it clearly represents a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The overall goal of our research proposal is to understand the neurophysiological and computational basis for ad hoc self-programmed behavior.  There have been significant barriers to the study of this topic. Among them are the difficulty of studying these processes in animals who require training (which by definition precludes single-trial self- programming), and the lack of access to opportunities with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to study neuronal processes in humans.  The proposed research seeks to address this gap. We leverage critical advances in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and computational modelling, including: 1) availability of a large-scale recording platform enabling simultaneous recordings of 100+ neurons from the cortical surface; 2) opportunities to record from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in human subjects engaged in a custom-designed behavioral task; 3) developments borrowed from the artificial intelligence community to create advanced neural network models of complex cognitive processes.  By applying these innovative methodologies, we focus on addressing our overall goal with three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we determine what information about the structure of a novel, complex, instructed task is represented in human dlPFC neuronal activity. We also determine how and when this information is encoded, in terms of spiking activity, oscillatory activity, or coherence between the two. In Aim 2, we determine the relationship between these neuronal representations and behavior. We investigate how the robustness and timing of the emergence of required neural representations relates to response accuracy and reaction time. In Aim 3, we develop a computational model of ad hoc self-programmed learning. To do so, we borrow from recent insights in the AI world regarding prefrontal network structure, and also apply our developing understanding of neural representations from the previous Aims.  We expect that this innovative approach will revolutionize our understanding of this amazing capacity for immediate, configurable learning that characterizes our everyday lives. In doing so, we will develop new strategies to study mechanisms of rapid, flexible cognitive control in general. A better understanding of human cognitive control and its nuanced capacities will naturally translate into an appreciation of deficiencies in these processes, and how they manifest in the form of neuropsychiatric disorders. This appreciation can then lead to the development of rational, targeted therapies. Project Narrative In our everyday lives, we frequently encounter situations that we have never previously faced, but to which we must respond appropriately on the first attempt. The human brain's remarkable ability to rapidly reconfigure its cognitive circuitry to match new task demands and thereby enable such behavior is a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The proposed studies leverage exciting new developments in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and artificial intelligence to understand the neuronal circuitry underlying this amazing capacity.","Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex",9628299,U01NS108923,"['Animals ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Architectures ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Cues ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Logic ', ' London ', ' Memory ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' neurosurgery ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Reaction Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Programmed Learning ', ' Amaze ', ' Custom ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Left ', ' Surface ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Response to stimulus physiology ', ' stimulus/response ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neuronal circuitry ', ' neuronal circuit ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Resolution ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Instruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' alzheimer model ', ' AD model ', "" Alzheimer's disease model "", ' cognitive control ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' operation ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' cognitive process ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' recurrent neural network ', ' ']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2018,704586,0.10611817743521706
"Multi-modal machine learning detection and tracking of traumatic brain injury neurodegeneration and its differentiation from Alzheimer's disease SUMMARY The proposed research focuses on the use of neuroimaging and machine learning to detect and understand the progression of neurodegeneration caused by repetitive brain trauma, and to differentiate this from that caused by Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other dementias. The deliverables defined in this Phase I stage will support the development of a commercial software product for use in pharmaceutical clinical trials and in clinical diagnosis. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) has been shown to cause cognitive deterioration and other symptoms that overlap those arising with AD. TBI can also lead to the development of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), which shares similarities in brain atrophy and tau accumulation with AD. There is mixed evidence as to whether TBI increases the risk or rate of developing AD, but regardless, the likelihoods of co-morbidity and misdiagnosis become high as individuals age. The relevant population includes professional sports athletes, individuals who played head contacting sports during high school or college, military veterans, and persons experiencing falls. However, the process by which TBI causes progressive damage, and the ways in which it can best be discriminated from AD, have not been determined. The aims of this grant focus on characterizing the progressive structural and pathology effects of TBI and discriminating these from AD using imaging of structure, function, and pathology, and machine learning. Classifiers will be developed using these information types alone and in combination. Innovations of this work include the use of a unique, comprehensive data set of imaging, cognitive, and other data acquired on more than 600 fighters by the Cleveland Clinic, a database of more than 10,000 well-characterized scans from persons across the spectrum of pre-symptomatic and symptomatic AD and other dementias, and a sophisticated machine learning software platform that addresses issues such as data overfitting and validation. Specific Aim 1 focuses on characterizing neurodegenerative changes that occur in fighters using volumetric (T1 weighted MRI) and white matter (Diffusion Tensor, DTI) imaging. Aim 2 will characterize tau accumulation in fighters and its relationship to and structural changes, comparing the two tracers 18F-AV1451 and 18F-FDDNP. Specific Aim 3 will determine methods to differentiate TBI related neurodegeneration from AD using structural and tau imaging. Follow on work in Phase II will include model refinement and additional validation with additional independent data, further prediction of cognitive impairment, extension to functional imaging modalities ASL and fMRI BOLD, dissociation of co-existing TBI and AD, comparisons to other forms of trauma, and development of software tools for commercialization. This work can have significant societal benefit through improved detection of TBI effects and precursors to greater damage and impairment, and accurate differentiation of AD and other dementias versus TBI effects to support optimal patient care. NARRATIVE This research addresses a critical gap in the understanding of the neurodegenerative effects of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), and the ability to differentiate effects of TBI from those caused by Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative dementias. Advances in machine learning will be applied to a unique multi-modality data set acquired in over 650 boxers and mixed martial arts fighters who have experienced varying exposure to head trauma and years since trauma was incurred, and to a data from a set of more than 10,000 scans acquired in persons at varying stages of mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. Outcomes of the research will enable a diagnostic tool to be developed that enables differentiation of TBI effects from those of other dementias, and that increases the understanding of the path by which TBI can cause progressive cognitive impairment.",Multi-modal machine learning detection and tracking of traumatic brain injury neurodegeneration and its differentiation from Alzheimer's

"Center for Identification and Study of Individuals with Atypical Diabetes Mellitus (U54) Diabetes is traditionally classified in two broad categories: autoimmune Type 1 and obesity-related Type 2. Numerous phenotypically and etiologically distinct forms exist and are emerging, collectively termed “atypical diabetes” (AD), that do not fit into either category. We hypothesize that AD comprises a spectrum that includes numerous forms, both known (e.g, MODY/monogenic, Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults, Ketosis-Prone Diabetes) and unknown. We propose to establish the Center for Atypical Diabetes Research and Evaluation (CADRE). The goals of CADRE are to (1) identify and define comprehensively the forms of AD; and (2) establish an extensive database and repository of biosamples from AD patients. Defining the forms of AD is challenging because the etiology of AD can range from a single gene variant to a highly complex mixture of genetics, epigenetics and environmental factors. To identify patients with AD, and then to define the forms, we will use a two-pronged approach. Approach (a) will use clustering analysis of genotypic and phenotypic data from diverse groups of patients with diabetes. We have recruited 15 domestic and international population cohorts with data on more than 33,000 patients with diabetes. Further, we have recruited six diabetes study clinics (Baylor College of Medicine [BCM], University of Washington [UW], Indiana University [IU], Emory University, University of Colorado, and SUNY Downstate) who will prospectively recruit patients. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation will facilitate recruitment from patient groups. The Administrative Core at BCM will work with cohorts and clinics to obtain data. The University of South Florida (USF) will filter data for AD and separate patients into phenotypically homogenous clusters that can be diagnosed based on genetic and clinical features unique to the cluster. Approach (b) will identify monogenic, oligogenic and mitochondrial forms of AD from patients enrolled in genetics registries (BCM) and a family study with genetic data (Botnia). The BCM registries include patients referred to the Undiagnosed Disease Network. All patients will undergo whole-exome and mitochondrial genome sequencing (Cores at BCM), single-nucleotide polymorphism variant analysis (Oxford), metabolomic analysis (Duke) and phenotypic analysis of C-peptide, adiponectin, proinsulin, islet autoantibodies, and serum insulin DNA levels (Cores at UW and IU). To establish the database and biorepository, we will invite patients with AD to participate in sample donation and longitudinal follow-up via the cohorts and clinics. Data and samples will be transferred to the Database and Biorepository Core at USF, with input and tracking implemented using the successful framework developed by USF for large multicenter trials. Data will be made available through the NIDDK and a CADRE website and samples will be made available through ancillary study application. Ongoing patient recruitment to expand the database and biorepository will occur through the study clinics and clinician referral through the CADRE website. Overall, CADRE will be built on a foundation of existing, successful core facilities and computational systems to create a lasting resource that will substantially advance AD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE For many people with diabetes, their symptoms do not match those usually associated with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We will use medical and genetic information from a large number of patients with diabetes to find all the forms of “atypical diabetes,” so doctors can better diagnose and treat these patients. We will also make the Center for Atypical Diabetes Research and Evaluation (CADRE) to keep data and samples from patients with atypical diabetes, so scientists can study these forms of

"A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs To stem the rising incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in our aging population, new methods to repurpose and combine drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) are acutely required. This is a challenge, however, because the complex polygenic basis of AD remains opaque, and rational methods to repurpose drugs are in early years, even for well-defined gene targets. To address these problems, we propose new algorithms to integrate data on a very large scale so as to combine evolutionary information and high-throughput experimental observations with the knowledge conveyed by text in the literature. First, to detect disease-relevant genome variations in AD patients, Aim 1 will combine a novel mathematical calculus of mutational landscapes with machine learning, in so doing suggesting primary candidate genes for drug targeting based on signs of mutational selection in cases or controls. Next, to repurpose and combine drugs targeting these genes, Aim 2 will map a large fraction of all that is known about genes, phenotypes, and drugs into a single high-dimensional network that represents their interactions as described in various databases (structured data) and in the literature (unstructured data). The topology of this network will determine the optimal choice of single drug or combination therapy in an approach that can be personalized. Finally, to validate efficacy experimentally, Aim 3 will test both our candidate genes and drugs with state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo screens. Feasibility rests with prior studies on evolution, networks, systems, and text-mining that demonstrate accurate predictions of deleterious mutations and their clinical sequelae and the discovery of drivers of diseases. Broadly, this work will yield proof of principle for a novel quantitative model that integrates fundamental concepts from mathematics and molecular evolution, and for a low resolution but large-scale map of biomedical knowledge in which network notions of distance computed by machine learning identify relevant functional hypothesis that would otherwise be easily overlooked. The result will be a new experimental ability to unravel the genotype-phenotype relationship in Alzheimer's Disease so as to guide drug therapy. Alzheimer's is a devastating disease projected to rise dramatically in our aging population. To develop drugs against it, we propose to train machine learning on the DNA of patients with Alzheimer's to detect genes with abnormal mathematical features in their mutations. Then, we will place these genes in a “map”, which represents a large fraction of biomedical knowledge in a high-dimensional network. The drugs that fall near our genes of interest in this map are our candidates, and experiments will test in cell and mouse models whether they affect the hallmark signs of Alzheimer's.",A knowledge

"Novel Approaches to Identifying and Engaging Disadvantaged Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in Clinical Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite well-documented disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prevalence, incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and mortality, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial/ethnic minorities) are disproportionately under-represented in clinical AD research. Current recruitment methods for AD research predominantly identify patients from outpatient clinics and community settings, or with pre-existing diagnoses. Reliance on these recruitment approaches may create barriers to participation for disadvantaged individuals as they are more likely to lack information about AD services, be undiagnosed and have limited access to outpatient care. Yet, greater enrollment of disadvantaged individuals into AD studies is critically needed to achieve national goals for AD research. Targeted AD screening and tailored recruitment within acute care settings has strong potential to address these gaps, as disadvantaged individuals often rely on these settings to meet their health needs. This K76 proposal is designed to provide Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi, PhD, a geriatric trained nurse and expert in AD symptom management with the training required for success as an independent clinician-scientist focused on improving AD identification to promote greater participation in research and access to effective care and therapies, specifically targeting high-risk disadvantaged populations. The overarching objective of the proposed research is to design screening and recruitment approaches for identifying and engaging disadvantaged AD patients/caregivers and their biological children in research from acute care settings. The proposal consists of validation of an electronic health record (EHR) Phenotype Model for AD using EHR clinical data identified in preliminary studies (Aim 1), and specification of this Model for performance among disadvantaged individuals (Aim 1a). To address recruitment from acute care environments, mixed methods strategies will inform the design of tailored recruitment approaches appropriate to acute care (Aim 2) which will be piloted with 30 AD patients/caregivers to determine their feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact on willingness to enroll in a Trial Registry (Aim 2a). As a junior faculty member at an institution with extensive support for early stage investigators and significant infrastructure in AD disparities and EHR Phenotyping, Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi is in an ideal environment to complete the proposed research and pursue advanced training relevant to her career goals. Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi’s career development plan integrates didactic and practical training, individual mentoring and mentored research activities in the areas of 1) clinical trial design, 2) advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, 3) acute care research, 4) AD health disparities, 5) recruitment and retention of vulnerable populations and 6) leadership. This proposed award addresses fundamental gaps and barriers to improve inclusion of disadvantaged individuals in AD research while affording training and mentored research critical for Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi to lead an independent research program in clinical AD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Under-representation of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial and ethnic minorities) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is a major barrier to achieving national AD research goals and exacerbates widespread health disparities in AD. The proposed research addresses fundamental barriers to research participation among disadvantaged individuals with AD through the development of novel 1) screening and 2) recruitment approaches within acute care settings, where many disadvantaged individuals routinely seek health care. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to improve access and engagement in AD research among disadvantaged groups.",Novel Approaches to Identifying and Engaging Disadvantaged Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in Clinical Research,9589379,K76AG060005,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Terminology ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' care episode ', ' Patient Care Episodes ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' Development Plans ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Techniques ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Exclusion ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) ', ' ICD-10 ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' disease phenotype ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' AD detection ', ' Alzheimer disease detection ', ' Alzheimer screening ', ' Alzheimer disease screening ', ' alzheimer model ', ' AD model ', "" Alzheimer's disease model "", ' high risk ', ' community setting ', ' group intervention ', ' screening ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' racial minority ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K76,2018,242555,0.35486632524462014
"Harnessing Diverse BioInformatic Approaches to Repurpose Drugs for Alzheimers Disease Abstract The exploration of genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes derived from brains with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by powerful computational tools has the potential of developing new knowledge, including the identification of pathways and targets that may be involved in the initiation and/or progression of the disease. The challenge is to find drugs that impact those pathways, and then validate the importance of those pathways – distinguishing primary disease drivers from secondary events. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to probe potential pathways in proof of concept, and ultimately therapeutic, clinical trials. Here, we propose to discover and validate hypotheses for drug repurposing in AD through three integrated, complementary informatics approaches. Specifically, we will apply classical and network aware (prior-loaded) machine learning approaches to identify pathways and targets altered in AD brains at different stages of disease progression using data from Accelerating Medicines Partnership-AD available through Synapse (Aim 1); we will use systems pharmacology approaches to discover the target selectivity of lead compounds in human neuronal and glial cell types using unbiased RNA-seq, proteomic and imaging studies followed by pathway analysis (Aim 2). Each of these two Aims has two approaches: data-driven, hypothesis-generating analyses to discern disease-relevant drug signals; and hypothesis-testing in which positive findings from one approach are evaluated using the other approaches to assess rigor and reproducibility. Moreover, RNA-seq and proteomic data collected in cultured human CNS cell types following exposure to potential disease drivers and/or FDA-approved drugs in Aim 2 will be fed back into Aim 1 as CNS-cell type-derived priors to refine the predictive models. In Aim 3, we will develop new informatics strategies to conduct in-silico drug trials in EHR data with “prospective” outcomes to validate hypotheses based on the omics data sets and extant literature, using two big data sets: the UK 20 year CPRD longitudinal records of 20M National Health Service patients, and the RPDR Database (based at Partners Healthcare) with 6 M individuals followed for over 20 years. This integrated informatics program compensates for the limitations of each individual informatics approach to promote discovery and critical evaluation of “lead compounds” for known and novel AD pathways. To execute this strategy, we have assembled a multi-site, multi-disciplinary team with expertise ranging from clinical care to computer science and systems pharmacology. Some of the team members are AD experts and others bring an outsider's perspective. Finally, as a deliverable, we will create open-source data packages to release all the supporting evidence, software, and data with provenance in accordance with FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible) standards through Synapse and the AlzDataLens platform developed at MGH (Aim 4). These data packages will help to prioritize follow on clinical and translational studies including collaborations with industry or members of the community at large involved in new clinical trials. Project Narrative Repurposing existing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to accelerating proof-of-concept and ultimately therapeutic clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We propose a bioinformatics campaign, parallel to a traditional drug campaign, using available expression data from AD brains in the public domain as our “laboratory” and electronic heath records(EHR) as our “clinical trial infrastructure”. Resulting data packages from these analyses will be shared on Open Science platforms and will help to prioritize follow on clinical and translational studies, ultimately leading to new clinical trials.",Harnessing Diverse BioInformatic Approaches to Repurpose Drugs for Alzheimers Disease,9662335,R01AG058063,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary

"Leveraging the Human Non-Coding Transcriptome to Identify Therapeutics for Healthy Aging and Alzheimers Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Age is the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Nevertheless, a majority of individuals do not develop AD by their 9th decade of life. We propose that targeting the endogenous protective mechanisms associated with ‘healthy aging’ represents a sound scientific paradigm for addressing AD prevention, especially if this can be achieved using a combination of pre-existing FDA approved drugs. Our initial models of human aging identified novel transcriptomic signatures of aging, common in human hippocampus and muscle, prompting us to develop an expanded biobank and an updated assay that integrates both protein coding and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) data using novel RNA quantification methods, and extensively phenotyped clinical resources. We have utilized this translational bioinformatics strategy and a novel human biobank to produce a robust prototype screen that successfully identified >100 drugs from in silico analysis using the NIH cMAP/LINCS database, including 29 chemical regulators of a proven longevity pathway (PI3K/mTOR, p<0.00001). We validated this activity in human primary cells. Here, our overarching goal is to refine this screen in a range of human cell models and identify optimal combinations of FDA approved drugs that positively regulate the healthy-aging-related RNA network without the focused need for direct PI3K/mTOR inhibition and hence reduced potential side effects. Through the pursuit of 3 major distinct but interacting aims, the present body of work will enhance the network modeling by incorporating human brain aging lncRNA responses; formatting the current validated assay into a higher-throughput screen able to examine ~5,000-10,000 combinations of individually active drugs. We expect to demonstrate that our strategy can guide repositioning of individual drugs into sets of drug-combinations that ‘switch on’ a healthy-aging profile in human cell systems. NARRATIVE The greatest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is age, and up to 10% of the population develops AD by the age of 65. Since over 1.2 billion people are set to reach 65yr world-wide in the coming two decades, the imminent socioeconomic costs mean that it is extremely urgent to identify practical solutions. We have discovered a healthy-aging molecular signature that is ‘druggable’; and have devised a high-throughput strategy to identify combinations of efficacious FDA-approved drugs that induce that signature. Unlike standard drug-development that is too slow, the present project aims to quickly select ideal drug combinations that might delay or prevent AD and motivate new clinical trials.",Leveraging the

"Computational Prediction and Functional Validation of Novel Epigenetic Risk Loci in Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the United States but has no disease-modifying treatments. AD is also a substantially genetically based disease but the heritability of AD declines with older ages-at-onset suggesting increased environmental contributions at older age. We propose to study the AD epigenome since it is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Here, we will study DNA methylation at the fifth position of cytosine, which could modulate transcriptional activity. We propose an innovative machine learning computational approach to discover new AD-associated methylation sites beyond what can be interrogated by array-based approaches. We propose to use machine learning classification models trained on existing AD epigenetic studies and publicly available, multi-omics data to generate an AD-specific “risk score” for each methylation site in the genome by leveraging the tremendous investment in AD research, particularly the Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD), and the Molecular Mechanisms of the Vascular Etiology of Alzheimer's Disease (M2OVE-AD). We predict that high scoring methylation sites will associate with AD, and we will test this prediction with a 2-stage (discovery/replication) study using a unique dataset of human postmortem brains from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) and an autopsy dataset from Emory University's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). Simultaneously, we propose functional studies in model systems to determine whether the selective identified loci could influence AD pathogenesis.  In Aim 1, we propose to build machine learning models and using the models to obtain, AD-specific “risk scores” for each of the 28 million methylation sites in the genome In Aim 2, we propose to test our models using a unique dataset of 1695 human postmortem brains from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) and 432 postmortem human brains from the Emory ADRC. Both ROS and MAP are prospective longitudinal studies annually collect data cognitive, mental, and physical health, and has the requisite available tissue and data from genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dPFC). We propose a 2-stage genetic study to validate whether predicted methylation sites are associated with AD. In Aim 3, we will examine the functional consequences of top AD-associated “risk scores” in relevant model systems, including fly, mammalian cell culture and mouse models of AD.  This project can potentially identify important molecular contributors of AD that might not be apparent through other approaches, leading to new insights into mechanisms and treatment targets for AD and thereby have an important and sustained impact on public health. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects 5.4 million people in the U.S and is the 6th leading cause of death. AD is a substantially genetically based disease, and our proposal aims to find new genetic causes of AD by employing cutting-edge computational approaches, followed by experimental validation. Discovery of new genetic causes of AD will: 1) shed light on new biological mechanisms, 2) facilitate development of new diagnostic tests, and 3) provide new targets for AD treatment.",Computational

"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death.

"A Proinflammatory Endophenotype to Predict NSAID Treatment Response Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials PROJECT SUMMARY It is our hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are heterogeneous conditions and, therefore, a paradigm shift is required to identify specific subpopulations for targeted interventions. This approach has generated significant success in other complex diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. A key opportunity in this context is the identification of those most likely to benefit from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs and other anti-inflammatory compounds. The relation between inflammation and the development of AD, MCI, and cognitive decline has received a great deal of attention with basic science and observational human studies demonstrating a protective effect against cognitive loss. Likewise, in our work, inflammation has been a key mechanism in the biological profile that is indicative of disease presence. Based on a wealth of literature (epidemiological, cross-sectional, pathobiological and animal model), multiple clinical trials have been conducted to determine the utility of NSAID compounds in treating or preventing AD (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study [ADCS] AD and MCI anti-inflammatory trials; Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial [ADAPT]); however, each of these studies failed to demonstrate therapeutic benefit, in fact some patients may have exhibited worsening cognitive performance with treatment. Our preliminary data suggests that particular subsets of patients in these trials did benefit from treatment and that our blood-based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify both positive and adverse responders within these trials. Here we propose to leverage three previously conducted clinical trials to test our hypothesis that our blood- based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify the subsets of patients who benefited from these previously conducted clinical trials. By conducting proteomic assays from existing biorepositories from the ADCS and ADAPT, we will address the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate the utility of the proinflammatory endophenotype as a means for patient selection into NSAID therapy for treating and preventing AD; Specific Aim 2. To determine if change in proinflammatory endophenotype scores over time is a biomarker of therapeutic response. By leveraging a highly innovative method and substantial existing resources, the current project addresses a significant need in the search for novel approaches AD therapeutics. The significance of the current project is the identification of a specific subset of patients who will experience clinically significant cognitive benefit from administration of NSAID medication. If successful, the current project will set the stage for a novel clinical trial that enrolls patients specifically based on baseline proinflammatory endophenotype scores for administration of NSAID therapy. In the long-term, this line of research is designed to build a person-centered (i.e. personalized) approach to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's diseases are a growing public health crisis impacting millions of elders world-wide with a health care cost greater than cancer and equivalent to cardiovascular disease. Current treatments only slow progression of the disease and new strategies are urgently needed. The relevance of the current project is the validation of a person-centered approach to treating Alzheimer's disease by identifying specific subgroups that are most likely to respond to targeted therapies. The outcomes of this project will fundamentally change the approach to the search for novel therapies for AD from the “one-size-fits-all” approach to the search for specific subgroups that can be treated with targeted medications.",A Proinflammatory Endophenotype to Predict NSAID Treatment Response Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials,9454213,R01AG051848,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', '

"Assessing cellular aging in old and rejuvenated neurons from Alzheimer patients SUMMARY  Dr. Jerome Mertens is a stem cell biologist specialized in modeling human neurodegenerative diseases. During his graduate studies under the supervision of Dr. O. Brüstle (University of Bonn), Jerome was extensively trained in human stem cell and reprogramming technologies, and cellular neuroscience, and he published three first-author papers on utilizing human pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons to model Alzheimer's Disease (AD). As a postdoctoral researcher at the Salk Institute under the supervision of Dr. F.H. Gage, Dr. Mertens acquired an exceptional foundation in functional neuroscience, nuclear pore biology and imaging. Being entirely dedicated to advancing human in vitro disease models, Dr. Mertens' research focus was to better understand complex human brain disorders and the process of neuronal aging. He could show that direct conversion of human fibroblasts into induced neurons (iNs) preserves signatures of cell aging, while iPSC reprogramming erases them. As a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Mertens thus far first-authored three primary research studies in Nature, Cell Stem Cell and Molecular Psychiatry. As an independent scientist, Dr. Mertens seeks bringing together his recent findings on modeling neuronal aging, his permanent interest in AD, and powerful systems biology and bioinformatic technologies to unravel the earliest age-dependent and disease- initiating mechanisms of sporadic AD. In his Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) proposal, Dr. Mertens, together with his Mentor Dr. F.H. Gage, and his Co-Mentors Dr. D. Galasko, Dr. M.W. Hetzer and Dr. G. Yeo, designed a dedicated training plan in systems biology and bioinformatics, and proposes a research project that sets out to reveal the impact of cellular aging in a human model for AD. In the first aim (K99 phase) Dr. Mertens will generate both phenotypically old and rejuvenated neurons from a large set of clinically well- characterized AD patients and matched controls to better understand the impact of neuronal aging on the pathology of sporadic AD. Following an unbiased transcriptome approach, he will analyze for AD-specific gene expression profiles and work to understand which of the AD-specific gene expression signatures and related mechanisms are age-dependent and which are age-independent. In a second aim (K99/R00 phases), Dr. Mertens will study the age-related dysregulation of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport and the import receptor RanBP17, which currently emerge as major topics in aging and neurodegenerative disease research. He will measure nucleo-cytoplasmic compartmentalization in young and old AD neurons and probe for nuclear transport-based mediators of age-dependent AD pathology using live cell imaging approaches. In a third aim (R00 phase), he will generate and analyze iNs from a large set of individuals suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and pre-symptomatic middle-aged donors, in addition to clinical AD patients. His goal is to find a trajectory in the transcriptomic AD motifs to pinpoint the earliest and potentially most treatable mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis, and to develop a biomarker for the detection of pre-disease AD.   NARRATIVE  The project by Dr. Mertens aims at deciphering the molecular and cell biological impact of human aging on Alzheimer's disease patient-specific induced neurons (iNs) and their rejuvenated counterparts (iPSC-iNs). Dr. Mertens will employ unbiased transcriptome approaches to analyze a clinically well-defined cohort of AD patient and control samples, and further extend the study to iNs from pre-AD (MCI) patients to find the earliest and most causative pathological mechanisms of the disease. Dr. Mertens will further extend his studies of age- dependent nuclear pore defects, and their effects on AD neurons.",Assessing cellular aging in old and rejuvenated neurons from Alzheimer

"CRCNS:  Pooling Multisite data and Staistical Tests for analyzing biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease Recent developments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aging research suggest that reducing future  cases may be feasible by preventing AD in high-risk individuals by initiating  treatments prior to neurodegeneration. Identifying such individuals requires  characterizing the earliest stages of dementia when individuals are still asymptomatic  and early disease effects are weak. To detect subtle (faint yet persistent) effects, large  sample sizes are typically needed, but existing studies are not sufficiently large to provide high  statistical power. Motivated by this critical need, this project will develop the statistical  theory and algorithms needed to pool multi-cohort Alzheimer's disease datasets to facilitate large  scale statistical analysis in samples of cognitively unimpaired individuals who are still  asymptomatic. The development will be driven by (a) new shape analysis methods to characterize  brain anatomy at the individual level and (b) statistical machine learning algorithms to enable  seamless pooling of data from different studies/cohorts. Specific Aim 1: Develop novel shape  analysis methods which enable testing advanced hypotheses in a way that is largely invariant to  study-wise biases in Alzheimer's disease datasets collected at two different research sites  (DELCODE, WRAP/WADRC) using compact descriptors of individual level brain anatomy  (neuroanatomical signatures). Specific Aim 2: Derive new statistical theory and  algorithms, based on classical statistical constructs and deep learning, for  harmonizing shape features and other clinical/cognitive features focused on early  Alzheimer's disease across the two sites. Specific Aim 3: Perform association and  prediction analyses on the pooled datasets to evaluate novel scientific hypotheses related to early  stages of Alzheimer's disease. We will analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, shape features   and longitudinal cognition (slopes/intercepts) and finally conduct analyses to better  understand heterogeneity and sub-groups within the pooled cohort of cognitively unimpaired adults.  Significance: This project will (i) lead to the development of efficient shape representation  frameworks that will allow testing advanced localized hypotheses on brain regions of interest  without requiring sub-field segmentation. The impact of these shape analysis methods will support  spatially localized brain image analysis in Alzheimer's disease and in aging studies more  generally. (ii) Produce harmonization algorithms and statistical theory to enable large scale  data pooling in Alzheimer's disease as well as a broad range of other aging and neuroscience studies. Alzheimer's disease is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States. This project is expected to shed new light on the early neurodegenerative processes that occur in Alzheimer's disease, as well as facilitate early detection of disease by providing the means to combine and analyze a large pooled dataset of MR images, CSF biomarkers, behavioral data and clinical evaluations collected among research participants evaluated in Wisconsin and Germany. New insights that emerge from this project are expected to facilitate future pooling of large datasets, as well as inform the design of new studies and development of new therapies for Alzheimer's disease and improve the health and well-being of many aging Americans.",CRCNS:  Pooling Multisite data and Staistical Tests for analyzing biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease,9692899,RF1AG062336,"['Adult

"Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and Clinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Cohorts The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is a prospective, community-based 3-generational study that enrolled participants between ages 20-50 and has examined them every 2-4 years to collect extensive lifestyle, vascular, biomarker data; 9300 have GWAS. Embedded in this cohort are 1036 multigenerational families. Surveillance for AD dementia (and MCI) has been ongoing for over 4 decades. We have identified 1421 incident AD, 1767 MCI, enrolled 800+ in a brain donation program, obtained 7000+ 1.5T brain MRI, and repeated, detailed neuropsychological assessments. We have recently obtained extensive omics in ~6000 (gene expression, methylation, miRNA, metabolomics and proteomics) and genomics (50X whole genome sequences [WGS] in 4197 with pedigree-based imputation to 6554) through the NHLBI funded SABRe CVD (omics) and TOPMed (WGS) programs. We seek to leverage these rich resources (>$25 million). We propose these specific aims: AIM 1 is to examine and explain temporal trends in clinical AD dementia in the FHS cohorts. The age-specific incidence of dementia has declined over the past 4 decades among FHS participants (in press). However, the reasons for this decline remain unclear. We thus propose to continue tracking temporal trends in AD dementia and MCI through intensive surveillance, and verifying diagnoses at autopsy. We hypothesize that better education, treatment of some vascular factors and protective lifestyle changes (diet, activity, social engagement) may partially explain these trends. AIM 2 is to identify the patterns and predictors of preclinical AD within FHS families by obtaining (i) a novel circulating biomarker (plasma tau on 8000+ persons, using samples collected 5-15 years ago and repeat assay in 450) to supplement 1000+ biomarkers already available, and (ii) brain imaging with tau- and amyloid- PET, 3TMRI, including assessment of functional connectivity, tractography and blood flow, in 450 dementia- and stroke-free, FHS participants age 35-75 on whom we have (a) directly verified familial cognition and AD dementia status (both parents and all 4 grandparents were FHS participants), and also (b) have WGS and omics data. AIM 3 is to utilize the available WGS and extensive `omics' data for deep molecular phenotyping of AD. We will undertake conventional family-based WGS analyses of AD dementia and preclinical AD endophenotypes and novel high dimensional (co-expression, network, systems-based) analyses in collaboration with Drs. DeJager (PI of Accelerated Medicine Partnerships-AD, with omics data in 1200 brains), Witten (award-winning mathematician in applying graphical analysis to omics) and Levy (PI of SABRe-CVD at FHS). We will validate our findings in unrelated and multi-ethnic (Omni) FHS participants, through collaborations with other cohorts, and share all data through dbGaP and BioLINCC for analyses by others. We expect to identify new biologic pathways, drug targets and biomarkers for AD, especially those applicable to the preclinical stage of AD and those explaining promising trends in AD risk; such pathways should prove most useful for AD prevention. Whereas the total number of persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) is increasing as the population ages, we have 4 decades of Framingham data suggesting that the risk at any given age is declining. We plan to study the reasons for this hopeful trend in detail through continuing our surveillance for dementia and cognitive impairment, collecting cutting edge brain imaging (amyloid and tau-PET, volumes, connectivity and perfusion on MRI) in the dementia-free (preclinical AD), and using sophisticated analysis of very extensive genetic and omic data already collected on Framingham subjects. This could help us better understand AD trends and biology and identify new biomarkers and treatment targets.   ","Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and

"Interactive Companion Robot for Preventing Neuro-Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer's and Other Dementias ABSTRACT  The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing worldwide, placing enormous burdens on healthcare providers, patients and caregivers. Many new treatments are in development and the consensus is that most interventions will need to be initiated as early in the disease progression as possible. Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) has developed sensitive non-invasive EEG biomarkers for early detection of Alzheimer's and evaluating treatment outcomes. The biomarkers are in use in drug trials and are being validated longitudinally in a large population of patients with Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and healthy controls. Patients with MCI are particularly interesting as potential targets for early intervention as MCI is often a transitional state between normal aging and dementia.  This proposal introduces a novel, socially assistive robot (SAR) protocol designed with the goal of slowing the progression of cognitive decline in patients with MCI. The team combines ABM's 15-year success in implementing real-time neuro-sensing and dementia biomarkers with academic and commercial expertise in robot behavioral intervention design. Dr. Maja Mataric, USC Professor, Dr. Cory Kidd, CEO and founder, Catalia Health, and Dr. Schneider, USC Professor, will work with ABM to enable the Mabu robot to interact with participants in their homes and influence healthy habits. Catalia demonstrated that the Mabu software use of artificial intelligence to encourage social interaction improves medical adherence. This project will develop a SAR-mediated intervention for elderly users and MCI patients. Mabu will interact with participants in their homes to encourage and monitor the formation of healthy habits involving physical activity, specifically walking regularly. ABM's mobile EEG sensing systems will be used to assess dementia biomarkers pre- and post-robot intervention and during initial and final human-robot interactions, providing real-time metrics including engagement, workload, stress, and other measures of interactions between human and robot.  The SAR is envisioned as a complementary approach that will support and enhance any combination of therapeutic interventions for dementia. The team envisions multi-stage user-robot interactions aimed at: increasing physical activity; enhancing cognitive skills; providing motivation; increasing well-being and improving quality of life. The Phase I focus is on increasing physical activity using the robot as a coach for a small cohort (10 healthy elderly; 10 MCI patients) selected from the ongoing ABM dementia biomarker study. Physical exercise is selected based on the specific evidence that increased activity can delay or slow cognitive decline. The Mabu robot will interact with participants twice daily in their homes for 6-weeks to encourage them to be more active. Project Narrative  This project addresses the worldwide demand for novel intervention approaches to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias introducing a novel, socially assistive robot (SAR) protocol designed with the goal of slowing the progression of cognitive decline in patients with mild cognitive impairment. The SAR is envisioned as a complementary approach that will support and enhance any combination of therapeutic interventions for dementia. If successful, the SAR intervention in combination with Advanced Brain Monitoring's objective EEG sleep and daytime dementia biomarkers has the potential to assist patients in living healthier and more productive lives, maintaining independence for longer periods of time, and removing some burden from caregivers.",Interactive Companion Robot for Preventing Neuro-Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer's and Other Dementias,9679688,R43AG061994,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cognition ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Medicine ', ' Moods ', ' Motivation ', ' Names ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Social Psychology ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Companions ', ' Robot ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' success ', ' professor ', ' computer science ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Study Subject ', ' social ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Aging Process ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' usability ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' normal aging ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' patient population ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive skill ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' Accelerometer ', ' early detection markers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' human-robot interaction ', ' ']",NIA,"ADVANCED BRAIN MONITORING, INC.",R43,2018,387579,0.11078135353293327
"Dementia Screening Using Automated Speech Analysis: A Pilot Study Project Summary Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is vital if treatments are to be most effective, yet for myriad reasons, a staggering number of older Americans do not receive diagnostic services. Recent technological breakthroughs show considerable promise to identify biomarkers for AD, but nonetheless still require costly and often invasive in-person testing. What is needed is a new approach that can rival current technologies in terms of diagnostic accuracy, while also permitting wider accessibility and economy. The ubiquitous telephone will be the vehicle for this approach in the proposed study. Telephone-based diagnostic screening tests have emerged as a viable alternative to in-person testing, and appear well tolerated and cost-effective. These tests are effective at detecting frank dementia, yet lack sensitivity to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) a likely risk factor for AD. Deficits in language function, particularly semantic knowledge, are characteristic of AD, and these changes may occur decades prior to the emergence of overt symptoms. Research from our group has demonstrated that automated speech analysis can quantify aspects of semantic knowledge in psychiatric samples and can provide similar information to human raters in terms of diagnostic accuracy. Hence, our goal is to determine the acceptability, sensitivity and specificity of an automated speech analysis approach to the detection of AD and MCI from speech samples elicited via telephone. Such an approach has the potential to greatly outperform current screening methods, not only in terms of sensitivity to cognitive decline, but also accessibility, cost, and user satisfaction. If successful, this project could form an integral part of an adaptive, machine learning decision support system to accurately predict an individual's dementia conversion threshold and trajectory of decline. Project Narrative Alzheimer’s disease is a significant and mounting public health concern, yet for a host of reasons, a staggering number of older Americans do not receive a diagnostic evaluation. The proposed study seeks to address this issue by leveraging a device ubiquitous in many homes: the telephone. Speech samples elicited via telephone will undergo computerized analysis, with a view to identifying cognitive decline at an early stage and potentially reaching many more people at a fraction of the cost of currently-available screening tests.",Dementia Screening Using Automated Speech Analysis: A Pilot Study,9524622,R03AG052416,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnostic Services ', ' diagnosis service ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Semantics ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Speech ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' success ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' Participant ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Economic Burden ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' AD detection ', ' Alzheimer disease detection ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' diagnostic screening ', ' symptomatology ', ' amnestic mild cognitive impairment ', ' ']",NIA,MARYMOUNT UNIVERSITY,R03,2018,83008,0.029464154853091364
"Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate is an epileptologist and neuroscientist at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Medical School, whose long-term career goal is to become an independent- ly funded translational investigator with expertise at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases. Patients with neurodegenerative diseases are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and patients with epilepsy often suffer from cognitive co-morbidities. The ability to translate the clinical experience, research tools, and intellectual framework from the field of epilepsy to that of the neurodegenerative diseases, and vice versa, could be a powerful approach to studying both processes. During the proposed training period, the candidate will combine her prior training in epilepsy, EEG signal processing, and machine learning, with newly acquired skills in neuroimaging (functional MRI), biostatistics, and additional clinical exposure to patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Under the mentorship of Dr. Sydney Cash, an expert in epilepsy and neurophysiologic signal processing, and the co-mentorship of Dr. Reisa Sperling, an expert in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and neuroimaging approaches, the candidate proposes to: 1) Delineate the spectrum of epileptiform activity in early stages of AD and develop computa- tional tools to identify this activity; 2) Establish the pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie epileptiform activity in AD; and 3) Determine how epileptiform abnormalities are associated with cognitive trajectories in patients with early stage AD. Visual and computational analysis of 24- hour scalp EEGs will be integrated with resting-state and task-based fMRI measurements, amy- loid PET imaging, and longitudinal cognitive testing from subjects with AD, to develop a com- prehensive understanding of the role of epileptiform abnormalities in early stages of AD. In addi- tion to the research proposed, the candidate’s career development plan entails rigorous coursework and seminars, practical hands-on experience, and close guidance from a board of academic advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow the candidate to establish a clinical and research niche at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases, and to develop a comprehensive toolbox with which to probe human brain function from the standpoint of neurophysiology, structure, connectivity, and tar- geted pathology. Collectively, these will form the foundation for a successful career as an inde- pendent investigator pursuing important clinical and translational research projects to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, or both. Project Narrative People with Alzheimer’s disease are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and people with epilepsy commonly suffer from impairments in memory and cognition. Our goals are to better understand the interplay between epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease, and to determine whether epileptiform activity may be a treatable contributor to cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s disease. This has important public health implications, as according to the Alzheimer’s Association, a treatment that slows the rate of progression of Alzheimer’s disease by five-fold would reduce the number of people with severe Alzheimer’s disease from 6.5 million to 1.2 million and reduce Medicare costs by 50% by the year 2050.",Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's

"The Macrovascular and Microvascular Contributions to Alzheimer's Disease: MESA VASCAD Project Summary Improving vascular health for delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is identified as a critical goal by the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias Conference, the 2015 NIA AD Summit and PAR-15-356 (to which this application is responding). Yet, critical barriers exist to implementing vascular prevention strategies for AD, and elucidating the role of midlife metabolic, macro- and micro- vascular factors in AD is essential to addressing these barriers. Each type of factor may manifest different pathologies in the brain that contribute to dementia sub-types, making a new and sufficiently comprehensive clinical trial a costly and time-consuming undertaking. To address this essential gap, we propose to leverage the rich longitudinal cohort data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study with the addition of detailed cognitive testing and multimodal brain neuroimaging – the MESA VASCAD study. MESA participants at the Wake Forest site (46% African-American, 54% non-Hispanic Caucasian) have already undergone extensive metabolic and vascular phenotyping, repeated retinal imaging and a brief cognitive assessment in 2010-2012. The MESA VASCAD study will add clinical and cognitive assessments (Uniform Data Set and supplemental cognitive tests); neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid PET); and reanalysis of retinal images. We propose to enroll 540 MESA participants in 2 years and repeat assessments 3 years later to more fully characterize targeted, modifiable vascular risk factors for AD. Through our Specific Aims, we will (1) test the hypothesis that baseline macrovascular and microvascular biomarkers in middle-age predict both standard AD neuroimaging outcomes (e.g. hippocampal volume and amyloid deposition assessed with PET) and more novel cerebrovascular biomarkers (e.g. microinfarcts, lacunar infarcts, neurite density and cerebral microbleeds); (2) determine if changes in metabolic and vascular biomarkers over 15 years predict cognitive and AD biomarker trajectory; and (3) using high-dimensional machine learning approaches, determine common, differential and interactive metabolic and vascular risk factor profiles among racial and APOE genotype groups. This proposed ancillary study, approved by the MESA Steering Committee, is led by a New Investigator with an experienced, multi- disciplinary team of collaborators. The MESA study is an ideal cohort for interrogating the questions in this proposal: it has highly detailed longitudinal risk factor data collected over 15+ years in a diverse cohort, which we can leverage and augment with cerebrovascular biomarkers, AD biomarkers, and cognitive reassessments - thereby creating a comprehensive brain phenotype dataset for vascular and AD risk factors. These new data will enable us to examine the timing and impact of vascular biomarkers on dementia biomarkers and cognitive trajectories before a diagnosis of pre-clinical and clinical AD-related disorders, meeting a critical gap in information that will help guide the development of novel therapeutic or prevention strategies for various forms of AD-related dementias. Project Narrative Vascular and metabolic disorders are proposed as potent modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, and may provide key routes for therapeutic and preventive interventions. We propose to leverage the vast resources of the NIH-sponsored Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study to examine the potential contributions of macrovascular and microvascular subclinical disease to AD-related pathology. At the Wake Forest MESA site, we will add neuroimaging, repeated cognitive testing, and reprocessing of existing digital retinal scans with novel measures of retinal microvascular architecture.",The

We will determine the high dimensional cellular and subcellular protein-level expression, interaction, and localization for AD-relevant molecules identified by genomic and proteomic studies in resilience and pathologic states using human brain sections from an ongoing proteomic investigation of AD. We hypothesize that in-depth, stage-specific phenotypic signatures extracted from these unique groups will provide insight into the modifiable factors that endorse the protective mechanisms of brain reserve. We will test our hypothesis through three Specific Aims: (1) Establish a subcellular, phenotypic framework of vulnerable and resistant brain areas. Next-generation MIBI equipment will be used to rigorously image 30+ proteins simultaneously; targets marking subtypes of neurons, synapses, non-neuronal cells, neuro-inflammatory, and vascular components will be concurrently measured. (2) Reveal cognitive resilience multiplexed phenotypes. Using approaches we have successfully applied in other single cell studies, we will analyze multiplexed imaging data with statistical deep learning methods already established in our lab to identify topological, cellular, and molecular phenotypic differences among resilient, co- morbid, and AD dementia. (3) Implement a shared data repository. The power of multiplexed imaging in biology is its ability to reveal co-localization or mutual exclusivity to infer regulatory roles and gain mechanistic insight. To disseminate hundreds of these images from our proposed highly multiplexed study, we will create a web-based portal, using already established infrastructure, where all of the images from this study can be accessed, multi-color overlays generated ad hoc, and all the features will be shared freely. PROJECT NARRATIVE AD is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the aging American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. Such signatures will provide insight into the modifiable factors that endorse the protective mechanisms of brain reserve. Such insights will illuminate pathways that hold potential for new therapeutic targets, as well as create a shared research resource and analysis platform for the community of scientists committed to developing solutions for AD.",MIRIAD - Multiplexed Imaging of Resilience In Alzheimers Disease,9565386,R01AG057915,"['Abbreviations ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease

"PREDICT-ADFTD: Multimodal Imaging Prediction of AD/FTD and Differential Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY  Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the most common form of dementia in adults over the age of 65, and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the leading cause of dementia in middle age, with the behavioral variant subtype (bvFTD) being the most prevalent form. The relationships between clinical syndromes and pathological causes are complex, which makes accurate diagnosis difficult. For example, multiple studies have indicated that a significant proportion of cases of AD-like dementia show evidence of non-AD pathology, such as inclusions of the transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a protein associated with clinical FTD. Also, AD neuropathology has been found in 15–30% of patient with the clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). As treatment agents with potential disease-modifying effects are developed, sensitive and specific biomarkers will be needed, so that they can be tested and then eventually used in the appropriate patient populations. In this project, we will focus on clinically diagnosed bvFTD and AD patients, and apply machine learning to multimodal neuroimaging (T1, FDG-PET) data pooled from large, multisite studies of AD and FTD. Our goal is to develop novel biomarkers that can differentiate bvFTD, AD and controls. Our hypothesis is that each neuropathology is associated with a distinct biomarker signature, and these signatures can be discovered through well-characterized clinical, neurological and neuroanatomical profiles. We will use available amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of β-amyloid and tau to assess the robustness of our predictions of AD neuropathologies. In Aim 1 we will use cross-sectional and longitudinal structural imaging to develop predictive biomarker models for differentiating bvFTD vs. AD. In Aim 2 we will use cross-sectional and longitudinal FDG-PET imaging to develop predictive biomarker models. In Aim 3 we will evaluate the combination of structural and FDG-PET imaging as predictive biomarker models.  Relevance: This research supports NIH initiatives on long-term, personalized precision medicine and big data science. Our predictive biomarker models can inform participant selection in clinical trials so that we can identify disease-modifying treatments with greater power. Our system-biology approach can enable us to generate new questions on mechanisms underlying the origin and progression of neuro-pathological processes, create new data and computational tools that can in turn generate new insights and new hypotheses. NARRATIVE  Accurate diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is difficult because the relationships between clinical syndromes, and pathological and genetic causes are complex. In this project, we propose to use machine learning technologies to develop powerful predictive biomarkers that can distinguish bvFTD, AD and healthy controls, using well-characterized clinical, neurological and neuroanatomical data from multiple national databases. As treatment agents with potential disease-modifying effects are developed, sensitive and specific biomarkers can be tested and then eventually used in the appropriate patient

"Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a growing epidemic, and potential treatments are unlikely to be effective unless deployed during the earliest stages of AD, prior to cognitive symptoms. Currently there are no inexpensive, non-invasive biomarkers for effective AD screening necessary for early recognition and treatment on a broad scale. Sleep is abnormal in preclinical AD, even prior to cognitive symptoms, and disrupted sleep may in turn accelerate AD pathological mechanisms. Electroencephalography (EEG) directly measures brain function, and the stereotyped nature of sleep EEG offers a particularly rich opportunity to identify biomarkers of brain dysfunction due to AD. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that sleep-wake brain mechanisms are abnormal very early in AD, and can be detected via subtle but distinct sleep and EEG changes. The objective is to develop sleep and EEG biomarkers of AD, to enable non-invasive and inexpensive screening on a large scale, through the following specific aims.  Aim 1) Identify sleep-wake patterns across the 24-hour day characteristic of AD pathology. Ambulatory sleep-EEG data will be recorded over the 24-hour period in the home setting from a large, diverse, community-based cohort, with the hypothesis that increased sleep-wake transitions over the 24-hour day are characteristic of preclinical-to-mild AD. Aim 2) Assess slow wave integrity measures as biomarkers of AD pathology. EEG abnormalities of slow wave sleep are particularly associated with elevated amyloid-β levels and plaques. Novel analytic techniques will extract bihemispheric slow wave coherence, slow wave velocity, and slow wave intradaily ratio from EEG data collected during sleep and wake. The hypothesis is that amyloid plaques present in early AD will reduce slow wave integrity by all three measures. Aim 3) Determine the EEG signature of AD using machine learning. Machine learning techniques will be applied to EEG from a full attended overnight polysomnogram, to identify a “signature” of AD pathology. The goal is to identify a “signature” that can be detected with spatially limited EEG data that could be collected at home.  The expected outcome of these aims is to identify sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD that can be detected noninvasively and inexpensively at home. The impact of our work will be the ability to screen large populations easily for AD pathology, so that affected individuals can be identified and treated. Moreover, sleep-EEG biomarkers could be used to track disease progression and treatment response in clinical trials for AD. Lastly, since sleep disturbance has a direct effect on AD pathology, by identifying sleep-EEG changes very early in the pathological process, we may be able to intervene, improve sleep, and potentially change the trajectory of AD.  ! Project Narrative Combating the looming crisis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) will require identifying and treating individuals with AD even before cognitive symptoms appear. The proposed project will develop sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD in a large, diverse, community-based cohort, which can be used for inexpensive, non-invasive screening for AD on a broad scale. This project will enable large-scale screening and treatment of early AD, use of sleep-EEG theranostic biomarkers for clinical and drug-development purposes, and intervention for sleep disturbances to potentially change the trajectory of AD.",Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease,9559968,R01AG059507,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Amyloid deposition ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Pathology ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Spinal Puncture ', ' Lumbar Puncture ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Amyloid beta-Protein ', ' soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' amyloid-b protein ', ' amyloid beta ', ' abeta ', ' a beta peptide ', ' Aβ ', ' Amyloid β-Protein ', ' Amyloid β-Peptide ', ' Amyloid β ', ' Amyloid Protein A4 ', ' Amyloid Beta-Peptide ', "" Amyloid Alzeheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein "", "" Alzheimer's amyloid "", "" Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein "", ' Alzheimer beta-Protein ', ' Measures ', ' tau Proteins ', ' τ Proteins ', ' tau factor ', ' tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Delta Wave sleep ', ' Delta Wave ', ' Slow-Wave Sleep ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Staging ', ' Senile Plaques ', ' diffuse plaque ', ' cored plaque ', ' aβ plaques ', ' amyloid-b plaque ', ' amyloid beta plaque ', ' Neuritic Plaques ', ' Amyloid Plaques ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' cognitive function ', ' Hour ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurobehavioral Manifestations ', ' neurobehavioral symptom ', ' Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms ', ' Cognitive Symptoms ', ' Cognitive Manifestations ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' sleep problem ', ' Napping ', ' response ', ' sleep onset ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Drug Development ', ' Clinical Drug Testing/Development ', ' Collection ', ' Scheme ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' amyloid imaging ', ' Alzheimer screening ', ' Alzheimer disease screening ', ' combat ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' theranostics ', ' screening ', ' early detection markers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' sleep quality ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,403908,0.2867538612344037
"Molecular Networks Underlying Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Among APOE E4 Carriers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The e4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene has been identified as one of the strongest genetic determinants of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In general, the e4 allele is associated with reductions in neural protection and repair, increasing a carrier’s vulnerability to damage accumulated over his/her lifetime. Nevertheless, while the penetrance of ApoE e4 is relatively high, a significant proportion of e4 carriers will never develop AD. The overall goal of this project is to model interactions across multiple omics networks to identify the biological pathways involved in sporadic AD susceptibility versus resilience among high-risk individuals. The multifactorial nature of AD suggests that it may manifest as a result of complex interactions across the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome. Identifying the central networks involved in AD pathogenesis will require integrative Systems Biology approaches. The proposed research offers a new and innovative way to integrate networks—a dominant feature in biology—across multiple tissues and omics platforms, in order to identify innate and dynamic precursors of resilience to AD, among a high-risk population (e4+). Towards this goal, we will: (1) employ newly developed GWAS-based network analysis, to identify SNP networks that alter the association between ApoE e4 and cognitive decline/dementia; (2) generate DNA methylation and RNA-seq data from brain samples that we will analyze using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (3) generate proteomic data from brain and CSF samples that we will analyze using WGCNA to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (4) use advanced integromic network analysis to identify multi-omics and multi-tissue pathways and biological systems involved in AD resilience. The integration of multiple 'omics' data using systems biology will be crucial for unraveling the connections and interactions between various functional levels involved in complex diseases, such as AD. Overall, our proposed research will improve understanding of the complex biology underlying AD susceptibility. These studies have the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets that could inform the development of future pharmacologic interventions aimed at preventing or slowing AD pathogenesis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individuals with the ApoE e4 genotype have a substantially increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The goal of this project is identify underlying biological interactions and networks that explain why some e4 carriers do not develop Alzheimer's disease, despite being high-risk. This research has the potential to uncover novel targets that can lead to the development of effective therapies for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",Molecular Networks Underlying Resilience to

"Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology 7. Project Summary/Abstract  In Alzheimer's disease (AD), irreversible neurological damage takes place years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, it is recognized that the development of AD dementia treatment and prevention strategies relies on the early detection of presymptomatic pathology. Previous studies demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD and precedes the formation of plaques and tangles that are hallmarks of this disease. The premise of this study is based on the unique sensitivity of the brain to systemic bioenergetic decline due to its exceptionally high metabolic demand. We hypothesize that bioenergetic capacity is related to early AD pathology and that bioenergetic decline is associated with the long term progression and severity of this disease. Recent work by our group and others demonstrate that blood- based bioenergetic profiling, utilizing cellular respirometry, provides a reliable measure of systemic mitochondrial function. The proposed study will determine whether blood cell bioenergetics is related to AD risk, pathology, cognitive performance, and changes in these parameters over time. Our long term goal is to develop a minimally invasive screening tool that can be used in a clinic/community setting to identify candidates for more intensive diagnostic testing, such as CSF biomarker analysis and brain imaging.  This project will be completed in an efficient and cost-effective manner by leveraging resources provided by the NIA-funded Wake Forest Alzheimer' Disease Center Clinical Core (ADCCC). Participants in the ADCCC represent a spectrum of AD risk and disease progression and are being extensively characterized for AD pathologies at baseline and 3 year follow ups. Our preliminary data from ADCCC participants indicate that bioenergetic capacity, measured in blood cells, is lower in participants with mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, our data suggest that bioenergetic deficits are already apparent in cognitively normal participants at high risk for AD. The aims of the proposed study are: 1) To determine bioenergetic profiles most strongly associated with AD risk and reporters of AD pathology (cognitive performance, CSF Aβ42/tau, hippocampal volume, brain amyloid, and cerebral glucose metabolism); 2) To determine the changes in bioenergetic profiles related to the 3 year progression of cognitive decline and reporters of AD pathology; and, 3) To determine the relationships of mitochondrial content and inflammation with bioenergetic capacity, and reporters of AD pathology at baseline and at follow-up. A central goal of the proposed study is to determine the specific bioenergetic parameters that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Therefore, in addition to convention analytical approaches, we will employ state of the art Machine Learning analyses to identify individual parameters or multivariate signatures that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Completion of this project can impact the detection of presymptomatic AD, provide insights into mechanisms underlying bioenergetic decline associated with AD, and broadly advance translational bioenergetics research. 8. Project Narrative  It is widely recognized that the implementation of successful Alzheimer's disease prevention and treatment strategies rely on the identification of patients at risk for developing the disease. The proposed project will examine blood based bioenergetic profiling as a minimally invasive strategy for determining Alzheimer's disease risk and presymptomatic pathology. The completion of our study aims will advance the development of an affordable screening tool that can be utilized in a clinical/community setting to identify individuals who are candidates for comprehensive diagnostic testing.",Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology,9517639,R01AG054523,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult

"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",9515964,R01LM012535,"['Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Beds ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Indiana ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Phenotype ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Public Health ', ' Science ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' interest ', ' user friendly software ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Proteomics ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Genomics ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' epigenomics ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' data integration ', ' Advanced Development ', ' Outcome ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' transcriptomics ', ' endophenotype ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' therapeutic target ', ' high risk ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' multimodality ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' multi-omics ', ' multiple omics ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2018,341899,0.13973608789443465
"Bioinformatics-predicted Alzheimer's risk factors and their role in synaptic dysfunction Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly that affects more than 5 million patients in the USA. Despite tremendous efforts to understand the pathophysiology of AD, no new therapeutic drug was approved in the last 10 years. A paradigm shift is needed in the approach to find effective treatment and cure of AD. Recent data demonstrate that synaptic failure is an essential cause of cognitive decline during the early phase of AD. Synapse loss in AD brain samples is the best correlate with the severity of cognitive impairment. The exact cellular process leading to such dramatic synapse loss in AD is still elusive. Technical advances allow now the detailed analysis of proteomics and mRNA sequencing and thus provide vast databases. Although multiple hits were described in genome wide association studies including novel genetic coding and non-coding regions, researchers are currently at the point they need to understand the molecular biology behind these genetic variations and how they impact AD. However, it is not clear how to best prioritize them for further study. This task is hindered by the fact that the physiological functions for the overwhelming majority of genes remain elusive as never tested in details. Here we propose a new innovative approach using bioinformatics, machine learning and synaptic functional assays to predict and analyze new pathways in the etiology of AD. Our iterative approach is based on prioritizing candidate genes that begins with previously validated software to predict AD-related phenotypes and is combined with a novel meta-analytic approach to predicting transcriptional changes with age. The candidate gene- phenotype list will be experimentally validated, and then this experimental data will in-turn be used to further refine the priority scores to be maximally sensitive to AD-related phenotypes. We expect that by combining transcriptional network behavior with literature-based relationships between genes, AD and AD-related phenotypes, we can determine the most likely phenotypic consequence of the identified variants linked to a specific gene. We also hypothesize that a subset of these variants encoding synaptic genes will cause synaptic dysfunction, which will be directly measured in cultured neurons and animal models of AD. We will test our hypothesis in two Specific Aims. The proposed research has the potential for significant impact as it will provide the AD field with a novel analytical tool to better predict risk factors and also will test for the first time genes or coding regions for their effect on synaptic transmission and AD pathology. Project Narrative  The proposed research addresses the pathomechanism of Alzheimer’s disease by combining bioinformatics to predict novel risk factors of this disease with detailed screening for their effects on neuronal communication. Understanding these novel pathways in the etiology of cognitive impairment has public health relevance as currently no effective therapy is available for dementia. Therefore, the proposed research is aligned with the mission of NIH that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burdens of human disability.",Bioinformatics-predicted

"Validation of a novel prospective circulatory biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease using the ADNI dataset. Summary This supplement will evaluate the utility of hemodynamic parameter maps extracted from resting state fMRI data, as early markers of cerebrovascular dysfunction in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). We have developed a method to derive maps of cerebrovascular function and dysfunction from resting state data, including through retrospective analysis of existing public datasets. These metrics are sensitive to both macrovascular and microvascular changes. In healthy tissue, vasodilation modulates cerebral perfusion in response to changing demands for oxygen and nutrients; this ability is reduced or absent in many forms of cerebrovascular pathology. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), is a measure of brain blood vessels’ capacity for vasodilation, which offer useful information on the health of local vasculature. Traditional analysis methods of hypercarbic CVR data underestimate CVR magnitude in regions where the response is delayed with respect to the gas administration schedule, and give no information at all about blood flow delay, a crucial feature of vascular dysfunction. We have validated a method to quantitatively map delays in blood flow arrival, and other hemodynamic parameters, even in the absence of external manipulations, allowing us to differentiate the circulatory and metabolic components of cerebrovascular compromise from resting state data alone. We have already demonstrated the utility of this approach in primarily circulatory disorders, such as stroke and moyamoya disease; this supplement seeks to establish the utility of this approach to probe early circulatory dysfunction in AD. Specific patterns of local alteration in circulation may precede (or even lead to) neuronal degeneration, and may serve as an effective biomarker for following disease progression. This supplement would be used to test this hypothesis in two ways. First, we will add a focused cohort of patients with mild cognitive impairment or probable mild Alzheimer’s Disease (16 subjects) to our active protocol studying subjects at risk for stroke. We will perform an abbreviated version of our extensive circulatory evaluation protocol to determine circulatory markers of early AD relative to our comparison group. Second, we will perform a broad retrospective analysis on the resting state fMRI data in the ADNI (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) database to measure circulatory parameters in a very large group that includes a range of diagnoses, and longitudinal data from a subset of subjects, to determine how regional bloodflow changes with disease progress. Finally, we will design and test machine learning classifiers to evaluate the ability of these circulatory markers to detect early AD/PRAD. These complementary efforts will test the hypothesis that specific, regional patterns of circulatory alteration progress with Alzheimer’s Disease, and may in fact precede other symptoms, allowing early, objective and quantitative detection of AD, and tracking of disease progression. Furthermore, this will serve as excellent preliminary data for designing more comprehensive efforts to develop this technique as an effective clinical tool. Narrative Cerebral hemodynamics plays an important role in Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias. However, existing assessment methods are not well suited to fully quantifying blood flow in pathology in the presence of delayed blood flow; delayed blood arrival is often misinterpreted as blood volume or flow decreases. In this supplement, we will extend our novel fMRI processing methods for extracting high quality hemodynamic parameters, including blood flow delay, from resting state fMRI data, currently being used to assess stroke risk, to examine the circulatory changes seen in early Alzheimer’s disease, in order to evaluate these parameters as an early biomarker to predict disease progression.",Validation of

"High-Resolution J-Resolved MRSI for Metabolic Imaging in Early AD AD is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline. AD  is increasingly viewed as a disorder of cerebral glucose metabolism, which is known to start up to  two decades before the clinical manifestation of AD. Several consensus statements have hence  highlighted the need for metabolic biomarkers to differentiate AD induced brain changes from other  forms of dementia, especially since pharmaceutical agents to treat AD are emerging. Highly specific  and sensitive quantitative biomarkers of abnormal glucose metabolism, which can facilitate  longitudinal studies, are urgently needed for the early detection and management of Alzheimer’s  disease (AD).  The main goal of this proposal is to develop a practical and reproducible J-resolved magnetic  resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) framework on a 7T scanner to probe abnormal metabolism in  early AD subjects. The focus of the parent grant is to develop a short protocol for  multi-parametric (T1, LGE, CINE) cardiac MRI using non-Cartesian sequences & machine learning. In  this supplement, we propose to extend the computational framework and non- Cartesian sequences  introduced in the parent grant to exploit the higher SNR offered by ultra- high field magnets (e.g  7T) to overcome the challenges in MR spectroscopic imaging. This approach will enable the accurate  estimation of the concentration of J-coupled metabolites that have significant overlap in 1-D MRSI.  Our previous supplement is facilitating the specificity and spatial resolution of T1rho, which is a  metabolic biomarker for acidosis resulting from accumulation of waste products in AD. This  proposal, if successful, will enable us to complement the acidosis biomarker with a broader array  of metabolites which will enable us to characterize the various stages of the pathological cascade  in early AD. Thus, this supplement will facilitate the development of a metabolic MRI toolbox, which will greatly  strengthen research on AD and related dementias.

"The Longitudinal Course O\F Imaging Biomarkers in People At RISK of AD The goal of this ongoing R01 is to chart the progression of pathobiologic markers of presymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and their effect on neural function and cognition in a late-middle-aged cohort enriched with risk for AD.

"Longitudinal Analysis for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in elderly people worldwide. Due to the fact that the longitudinal abnormality associated with AD can be detected in vivo, neuroimaging measures have been playing an increasingly important role in searching for biomarkers of AD that can be used for early diagnosis, progression monitoring, and therapy responses measurement. The goal of this project is to create a set of cutting-edge computational tools for identifying very early biomarkers of AD and alert AD progression via longitudinal image analysis. The key to achieve high sensitivity and specificity AD diagnosis of individuals is the stable longitudinal measurements. In light of this, the candidate will first develop a novel learning-based 4D (3D+t) landmark detector (Aim 1) to find the landmark locations at all time points simultaneously. The trajectories of landmark set form a compact 4D shape representation to achieve temporal consistency in registering longitudinal image sequence to the template (Aim 2). As a result, the consistency of low level features extracted from MR or PET images can be significantly improved. Since the subject-specific patterns of structural/functional changes, although more relevant to AD diagnosis of individuals, is very subtle compared to huge variation across subjects, the candidate will further develop a supervised deep neural network to learn the latent high-level spatial-temporal patterns by coupled stacked auto-encoder and temporal max pooling (Aim 2). The learned spatial-temporal morphological patterns consist of (1) cross- sectional features from MR and PET images, and (2) dynamic short/long term longitudinal patterns w.r.t. different number of historical time points. In a clinical setting, not all patients have a large and complete set of neuroimaging data, or an equal number of imaging scans. In order to eventually translate to clinic arena, a novel AD detector that uses a spatial-temporal hyper-graph learning framework (Aim 3) is proposed to not only provide high sensitivity and specificity in AD diagnosis but also solve the above difficulties. To evaluate the diagnostic value, we will apply our trained AD detector to ADNI dataset and patient data collected in UNC (Aim 3). Finally, we will package all our developed methods into a software package and release it freely to the neuroimaging community, to facilitate other AD-biomarker-exploration projects performed in other institutes. Project Narrative This proposal aims for the development of novel neuroimaging analysis methods for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using longitudinal image data. In particular, a set of automated algorithms will be created to aid the difficult task of analyzing subtle and complex morphological change patterns of Alzheimer's disease during the disease progression. The successful completion of this project will represent an import milestone in neuroimaging research by bringing forth the fruition of a powerful and practical system for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at individual level, for potential effective treatment.",Longitudinal Analysis for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,9484199,K01AG049089,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Evolution ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Deformity ', ' Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Anatomic Abnormality ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' interest ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' Graph ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' image registration ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' task analysis ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' functional loss ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' candidate marker ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' structural anomalies ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' Structural malformation ', ' Structural defect ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' individual patient ', ' early detection markers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' interindividual variation ', ' inter-individual variability ', ' inter-individual variation ', ' frontotemporal degeneration ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K01,2018,117098,0.3243259608580496

"Manifold-valued statistical models for longitudinal morphometic analysis in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) Project Summary The ability to quantitatively characterize incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in its preclinical stage is a critical step for early interventions involving disease modifying therapy and for designing efficient clinical trials to test therapy efficacy. This project focuses on deriving statistical image analysis methods for identifying the relationship of morphometric changes in this early stage with direct indicators of AD pathology (such as amyloid deposition) and various risk factors such as family history in late midlife adults who are cognitively healthy. The proposed analysis will be conducted on the largest preclinical AD cohort assembled to date and help elucidate how clinical-cognitive-imaging AD phenotypes emerge in asymptomatic individuals at risk for AD. The core of our analyses is a set of algorithms that allow operating directly on powerful “manifold-valued” representations of morphometric change and consequently yield high sensitivity in picking up real but statistically weak multi-modal patterns of the disease process. Hypothesis: 1) Detecting precise associations between morphometric changes in preclinical AD subjects with amyloid burden and various risk factors is possible using new algorithms that work directly with representations of the Jacobians of the deformation fields derived from longitudinal imaging data. 2) Conducting such analyses on a large multi-site cohort of asymptomatic at-risk preclinical AD individuals with identified AD pathology will a) reveal important insights into early disease processes when dementia is 15+ years away, b) provide preclinical AD biomarkers and c) provide frameworks for predicting clinical endpoints at the level of individual subjects. Specific Aims: 1) To develop new algorithms for performing statistical analysis of manifold representations of morphometric changes concurrently with multiple covariates representing risk factors, AD pathology markers, and clinical/cognitive measures. 2) Conducting an end-to-end analysis of two independent preclinical AD cohorts to identify the relationship of morphometric changes with various predictors as well as test/retest validation across sites. 3) Analyzing the largest preclinical AD cohort to date for characterizing the relationship of the entire spectrum of predictors to clinical endpoints for late midlife individuals. 4) Providing industry- strength open-source software implementing the full suite of models, integrated with existing software toolboxes, for deployments on a workstation, a high throughput cluster or the cloud. Significance: This project will have a significant impact across three distinct areas of brain imaging research: 1) characterization of how clinical-cognitive-imaging AD phenotypes emerge in asymptomatic individuals in the earliest stages of AD, 2) rigorous algorithms for morphometric change analysis in neuroimaging and neuroscience, 3) open-source end-to-end implementations of the algorithms for use within the community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This project will develop novel statistical image analysis methods to characterize complex morphological brain changes in healthy individuals who are at risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and also have some evidence of AD related pathology. Studying and quantifying the evolution of early disease processes in late midlife adults (who are cognitively healthy) on the largest “preclinical” AD cohorts assembled to date will yield frameworks that tie such disease patterns to precise clinical endpoints, such as cognitive decline. These preclinical AD biomarkers have direct applications in a) design of clinical trials for new therapies and b) eventual translation to clinical practice.",Manifold-valued statistical models for

"Functional Regression and Subgroup Analysis for Asynchronous Longitudinal Data. Project Summary / Abstract Asynchronous longitudinal designs have been widely used in studies on aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In these decades-long studies, as longitudinal variables were routinely collected from di erent platforms (e.g. food frequency questionnaires, lab results and clinical or psychological tests), the obtained data were not synchronized in time even for the same subject. As part of the motivating Normative Aging Study (NAS), it was of substantial interest to address whether dietary intake of niacin was associated with incident AD and cognitive decline. In the study, four cognitive tests were administered to participants in a span of 6 years after participation, and nutrient intake was determined by food frequency questionnaires distributed at the baseline and between adjacent cognitive tests. As a result, the exposure variables, including nutrient intake, and the outcomes of cognitive tests, were measured asynchronously. Naive analyses ignoring the mistiming issue will lead to biased results and wrong conclusion. In addition, the development of aging-associated diseases tends to di er in various (latent) subpopulations, where associations between disease progression and biomarkers and environmental exposures vary substantially across subpopulations. Subgroup analyses in aging populations are crucial for developing better strategies of preventing, treating and managing aging-associated diseases, such as AD.  Accounting for the peculiar nature of the NAS data, the proposed methods will help address the key question on the association between dietary intake of niacin and incident AD in the NAS. We will also examine other biomarkers and environmental exposures associated with AD. The proposed subgroup analysis will also help identify latent subgroups within the aging population and discern subgroup-speci c risk factors leading to cognitive impairment. Unlike the existing work relying on restrictive model assumptions, the proposed methods are fully nonparametric, data adaptive and can be combined with state-of-the-art model selection methods to choose relevant risk factors for AD from hundreds of variables that might be time varying and asynchronous with the response. Methods and theory developed in this project will be widely applicable to other longitudinal studies. We will also develop new computation tools and software packages that are scalable for large longitudinal data sets with long followups.

"Using connectomics to characterize risk for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION The prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years. While research efforts continue to focus on the causes of AD and to develop effective medical treatments, there is also a pressing need to characterize risk for AD before the disease is diagnosed. There may be subtle changes in brain and cognitive function that are detectable before major symptoms emerge. One approach for characterizing these vulnerabilities is the use of functional and structural neuroimaging to identify risk profiles for AD. The present study proposes and tests a model of AD pathology using neuroimaging network analysis and machine learning approaches to provide insight on widespread changes in information processing in the AD brain. The proposed model hypothesizes that some aspects of network information processing reflect neurodegeneration and cognitive decline associated with AD pathology (e.g., hub connectivity and global connectivity) whereas other network properties reflect attempts to compensate for compromised information processing (e.g., diffusion of information). In addition, this proposal compares the efficacy of models with respect to discriminating diagnostic categories (e.g., machine learning classification of AD and clinically normal subjects) versus isolating underlying dimensions of AD cognitive decline (e.g., machine learning prediction of memory and language scores from network features). Finally, this study will determine whether features of AD pathology are present in an at-risk sample of subjects; namely, individuals diagnosed with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). This will be examined by transferring the AD network models to aMCI subjects and testing whether the model can discriminate aMCI from clinically normal matched controls and whether the model can predict scores on cognitive tests. The analytic approach will using resting state fMRI data as a primary assay of network integrity, but diffusion imaging and task fMRI data will also be examined in an exploratory aim. The general approach will recruit individuals with AD, aMCI and clinically normal matched controls for each diagnostic group. The groups that are compared directly will be matched for amyloid status, as indicated by florbetapir PET imaging. The novel contributions of this project include (a) testing a network model of AD pathology that unifies various measures of network functioning, (b) comparing efficacy of modeling with respect to delineating diagnostic categories versus capturing underlying cognitive dimensions of AD, and (c) transferring the AD model to an at-risk group to assess disease vulnerability. This latter innovation can be applied in future studies to any group of subjects that is defined at risk, such as those with genetic vulnerability or positive family history. The present study also sets the stage for a subsequent longitudinal follow-up study to validate whether individuals identified at risk using network modeling actually convert to AD. Ultimately, network modeling of this sort may be used as a relatively less expensive and less invasive biomarker than PET imaging, which could lead to earlier treatments and interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE With the prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years, there is a pressing need to characterize risk for AD before the disease is diagnosed. The present study will use neuroimaging to examine brain connectivity and determine whether some aspects of altered connectivity are present in individuals who are at risk for AD: individuals who have mild cognitive impairment. This approach could be used in the future to possibly detect risk for AD before any cognitive symptoms emerge, thereby enabling earlier treatment and intervention to combat the devastating cognitive,

"The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as Revealed by Next-Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of disability and death in the US and a major global public health problem. Time is running short if we wish to avert a global public health disaster with untold suffering, disruption of families, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies. Solutions will come only from innovative research. Genomic studies for late-onset AD (LOAD) have identified over 20 risk loci; however, translating the relevant molecules identified by genomics to AD-specific mechanistic pathways has been challenging. Our application, entitled “The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline Revealed by Next- Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging,” is highly responsive to this urgent scientific need by proposing a uniquely innovative molecular imaging platform called multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) that will determine high dimensional protein interactions for AD-relevant molecules identified by genomics studies in normal and pathological states. Our proposal has three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we propose to analyze four regions in healthy aged brains: two sectors of the hippocampal pyramidal layer and from two isocortical regions. Next- generation MIBI instrumentation will be used to image simultaneously 30+ proteins that mark subtypes of neurons, synapses, and non-neuronal cells, while covering regulatory signaling, neuro-inflammatory components, and AD risk gene protein products with subcellular resolution. In Aim 2, we propose to use the same multiplexed imaging methods in AD brain stratified by APOE genotype. We will analyze these data with statistical machine learning methods already established in our laboratory, similar to what we have done previously with different cancers and the immune system. In Aim 3, using infrastructure we have already have established, we will create a web-based portal where all of the images from this study can be accessed, multi- color overlays generated ad hoc, and all the features we derive shared freely. We propose a transformative, collaborative approach to AD that leverages a long-standing NIA-funded longitudinal cohort and is highly responsive to the National Alzheimer's Plan. These novel insights will illuminate pathways that hold potential for new therapeutic targets and will create a shared research resource and analysis platform for the community of scientists committed to developing solutions for AD. Project Narrative AD is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the ageing American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. The overarching goal of this proposal is to generate a phenotypic landscape of cognitive decline, to understand modulation of cognitive decline during compensation and relate genetic predisposition to changes in phenotypic landscape defined by muti-parametric measurements using enabling technologies like multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI).  ",The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as

"Novel whole-genome analysis methods for Alzheimer's risk prediction Project Summary/Abstract  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects millions of Americans, yet there are no treatments that meaningfully affect disease progression once symptoms manifest. This has shifted the focus to early detection and intervention, which is thought by many researchers to offer the best chance of slowing or stopping the progression of AD. However, trials aimed at averting the underlying causes of disease have proven difficult because pathological changes in AD happen well in advance of cognitive decline. A widely-available genetic test for determining AD risk early in life, while prevention might still be possible, would allow early treatment intervention, enrollment in clinical trials, and improved patient stratification for testing treatment effectiveness. However, despite recent advancements, genetic risk prediction models (GRPMs) for late-onset AD (LOAD) lack sufficient discrimination ability to support such applications. Given the lack of effective treatments once symptoms have manifested and the socioeconomic consequences at stake, there is a serious unmet need for a widely-available GRPM able to accurately assess a patient's risk in middle age or earlier, before neurodegeneration begins.  To address this need, Parabon has teamed with AD researchers from Washington University and Emory to develop a GRPM able to accurately predict an individual's risk of developing LOAD at various ages. Phase I demonstrated that this GRPM, which exploits diagnostic heterogeneity, non-additive (epistatic) interactions among variants, and machine learning, significantly outperforms traditional risk factors. In Phase II, the GRPM will be further optimized, validated, and commercialized as a direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic health risk assessment test. In Aim 1, thousands of new and existing case and control subjects with genotypes and detailed phenotypes will be added. In Aim 2, novel approaches to feature selection for epistatic interactions will be implemented to increase the generalizability of selected features. In Aim 3, the selected genomic features will be used to predict imaging and biomarker endophenotypes of LOAD. In Aim 4, the out- of-sample endophenotype predictions will be combined into a final predictive model for AD diagnosis that can be applied to new subjects at any age, which will be validated in an independent replication set. Finally, in Aim 5, data and results will be prepared for scientific publication and submission to the FDA for marketing authorization as a DTC genetic health risk assessment system. Project Narrative Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects millions of Americans, yet there are no treatments that significantly slow disease progression once symptoms manifest, making early intervention crucial to reduce the individual and societal burden of this disease. This proposal seeks to create a genetic risk prediction model that can predict an individual's AD risk at any age, which will be made widely available as a direct-to-consumer genetic health risk assessment. It will enable early intervention and life planning for at-risk individuals and allow researchers to maximize the probability of detecting treatment effects in clinical trials by assessing patients'

"Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease using structural systems pharmacology. Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple health threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, efforts in drug discovery and repurposing for the treatment of AD have had limited success. The failure is largely attributed to the adoption of a reductionist model of “one-drug-one-gene- one-disease”. As AD is a multi-facet complex disease, a new treatment approach is urgently needed to simultaneously target multiple pathological processes responsible for the onset and progress of AD, some of which are also common to other diseases that cause dementia. In this application, we will develop an innovative translational bioinformatics approach to addressing challenges in AD drug discovery. Our approach is based on a new paradigm of systems pharmacology, which focuses on defining multiple targets to a single drug or a drug combination, and studying the effect of the drug(s) on perturbing disease-causing networks. Over the last ten years, we have developed a novel structural systems pharmacology (SSP) platform that can predict genome-wide high-resolution protein-chemical interactions and correlate molecular interactions with phenotype responses. The SSP platform synergistically combines novel methods from machine learning, bioinformatics, biophysics, and systems biology. We have successfully applied the SSP platform to drug repurposing, polypharmacology, side effect prediction, precision medicine, and Genome-Wide Association Studies. Building on our successful proof-of-concept studies, and in close collaborations with experimental laboratories, we will develop, and rigorously test a novel SSP approach to AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology. Firstly, we will develop a drug-gene-disease multi-layered network model (MULAN) that links FDA-approved drugs with neurodegenerative diseases through protein-chemical interactions, gene- disease associations, and chemical-disease associations through integrating multiple omics data. Secondly, we will improve and apply our proven successful SSP platform, which can accurately infer novel relations from sparse and noisy MULAN, to identify safe FDA-approved drugs that can be repurposed for AD treatment. Finally, we will experimentally test FDA-approved drugs identified for their binding activity of drug targets and anti-AD potency in cell and animal models. The successful completion of this project will provide an integrated computational modeling framework for AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology as well as identify novel targeted anti-AD therapeutics toward pre-clinical trials. Relevance Statement Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, AD is a complex disease that has been extremely hard to treat with the conventional approach. New methods that can reuse old drugs to target mulple pathological processes in AD may provide new solutions to effective AD treatment.",Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease using structural

"5R01GM120033-02 Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining Supplement Proposal ABSTRACT  In response to the NOT-AG-18-008, we are submitting a supplement to our parent R01 5R01GM120033-02 to extend the proposed work to Alzheimer's disease (AD).  Within our R01 award, we are developing two powerful new automated algorithms to capture biomarkers of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s Disease. Both of these tools capitalize on recent developments in machine learning; one of them, NMRQuant, has already been validated on simulated and phantom nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data and is ready to be applied to biological samples. We propose to examine the plasma samples obtained from the Texas Alzheimer’s Research and Care Consortium (TARCC), which prospectively collects demographic, environmental, neuropsychosocial, and genetic data along with the biofluid samples, in consecutive 1-year follow-up analyses that track various health outcomes. We hypothesize that progression of cognitive dysfunction from mild cognitive impairment to AD are accompanied by quantifiable changes in small molecules and metabolites in peripheral plasma. We will test this hypothesis on patients with AD, those with mild cognitive impairment, and healthy controls. We are uniquely positioned to advance biomarker and diagnostics tools as well as screening methods for cognitive deficits in AD, given that we have access to the state-of-the-art equipment, data collection expertise, and new analytical algorithms with superb sensitivity and specificity for NMR spectral data. Application of NMR metabolomics to AD could provide diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of cognitive status, which is necessary for measuring both disease progression and treatment response. This work may thus hold a promise to bring transformative data to the field of AD. NARRATIVE As we seek to develop treatments for Alzheimer disease (AD) and other forms of cognitive decline, it is important to develop sensitive and specific biomarkers that can monitor disease progression and therapeutic response. The metabolome is a dynamic and sensitive biological system, reflecting both innate processes and environmental influences, and thus, to a great extent, an organism’s health and homeostasis. In this study, we will use metabolomics platform to examine plasma from a large cohort of prospectively followed healthy individuals, those with mild cognitive impairment, and those with AD, collected by the Texas Alzheimer’s Research and Care Consortium (TARCC).",5R01GM120033-02 Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining Supplement Proposal,9719311,R01GM120033,"['Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Award ', ' Data Collection ', ' Equipment ', ' Health ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Methods ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Research ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' Peripheral ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' small molecule ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Data ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biological systems ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' metabonome ', ' metabolome ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' ']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,232653,0.3271158809291432
"Disparities in the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Among African American and European American Veterans Summary/Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that currently affects more than 5 million Americans, a number that is expected to triple by 2050. The National Plan to Address AD has articulated a vision for the development of specific treatments for AD by 2025, and it is critical that minorities and Veterans be included within the scope of this projected research progress. However, the diagnosis of AD is complicated by the lack of confirmatory diagnostic tests and the presence of other comorbid processes, including cerebrovascular disease, PTSD, and traumatic brain injury. These issues have contributed to a significant underdiagnosis of AD among Veterans, particularly among African Americans (AAs).  Considering diagnosis of AD in an ethnic minority context means paying particular attention to AAs, who have estimated dementia prevalence and incidence rates that are about two times higher than the rates in European Americans (EAs). There is also evidence of racial disparity in dementia care, though the magnitude of this disparity is unknown. To better understand the magnitude of the underdiagnosis of AD, this proposal will leverage the big data resources of VHA, where ~0.6 million AA Veterans who are age 65+ receive care—this is one of the largest samples of older AAs with associated electronic health records (EHRs) in the U.S. Given that it is infeasible to conduct manual record reviews or in-person evaluations in every Veteran served by VHA with undiagnosed AD, Specific Aim 1 will develop an AD-status model by applying novel weakly supervised machine-learning methods to the EHRs of 22,000 AA and EA Veterans who are age 65 or older. These weakly supervised methods are novel in that they will permit data mining within a large number of EHRs, including both structured and unstructured data, without initial human annotation or labeling. By developing an AD-status model in this way, the proposed work will avoid the potential limitations of past natural language processing studies of AD, which used predetermined search terms to generate models and were not sufficiently accurate. Specific Aim 2 will conduct medical record reviews and telephone assessments, the “silver standard” for diagnosing AD, in 600 randomly selected Veterans and their caregivers. This combination of machine learning and follow-up assessment, which has not been previously utilized in AAs or AD, will enable the validation and refining of the AD-status model so that it can predict the likelihood that AA Veterans are true AD cases. In this way, the proposed interdisciplinary team of dementia specialists, bioinformaticists, and biostatisticians will likely demonstrate the rapid and efficient detection of complex and costly disorders like AD. This has the potential to lead to earlier and more accurate diagnoses of AD, which can then improve Veteran access to medical and psychosocial supports and delay institutionalizations. Thus, future investigations of short- and long-term biomedical, pharmacological or system-level AD interventions will be feasible in AAs. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an increasingly common neurodegenerative disorder that is underdiagnosed in African Americans. To help reduce AD-related health disparities, we will use novel weakly supervised machine- learning methods in VHA's electronic health records, to develop a model that detects undiagnosed AD.",Disparities in the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Among African American and European American Veterans,9760728,R56AG059739,"['learning strategy ', ' dementia care ', ' data resource ', ' Adult

"Development and validation of novel tests in the DCT drawing analysis platform for the detection of Alzheimer’s Disease-related early cognitive impairment Project Summary/Abstract Early detection of AD and AD-related dementias is critical for the development of novel therapeutic agents and for effective patient treatment and care. DCT has created a platform able to detect subtle changes in behavior indicative of early cognitive impairment by using a digital pen to record drawing motions and automatically analyzing that data using a combination of artificial intelligence and neuropsychological analysis. DCT has successfully launched its first test on the platform, DCTclockTM, which has been demonstrated to detect subtle cognitive change in early Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and AD-related dementias earlier than standard cognitive tests, correlate with known AD biomarkers such as amyloid and tau in preclinical-AD subjects, and detect known APOE genetic risk in cognitively healthy participants. The test is FDA-cleared to market for general cognitive assessment and is currently used in multinational clinical trials, research initiatives, and by practicing clinicians for patient care. DCT is now conducting a study involving 400 participants ranging from cognitively healthy to demented to validate a tablet as input device for the drawing data, and to collect data on a set of novel tablet-based drawing tasks including: a symbol task, a visual retention task, a trail making task, a path- finding task, and a visuoconstructional task. We aim to analyze task data collected in the study to produce a set of easily-deployable, rapid, cost-effective, and sensitive tests to be used as cognitive digital biomarkers in clinical trials for AD and AD-related dementias. The first aim is to develop novel cognitive measures from these additional tests and obtain preliminary validation. Existing data will be split into training and testing sets. The training set will be analyzed to develop metrics, following an interpretable hierarchical analysis structure with low-level drawing measurements combined in a set of composite scales tied to a cognitive concept (i.e., information processing), and then further combined to obtain a simple 0-100 score for performance on the test. The testing set will be used to conduct preliminary validation consisting of a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis, correlation measures to existing neuropsychological tests, and test-retest reliability measurements to ensure repeat testing stability. The second aim is to implement the developed metrics in the commercial DCT platform. Robust software will be created for the measurement, storage, and display of the novel metrics, setting a foundation to enable usage of the metrics by research and commercial partners. Project Narrative Novel therapeutic agents for Alzheimer’s disease rely on recruiting subjects who are in the earliest stages of pre-symptomatic impairment and the ability to accurately monitor these subjects. This project will produce a set of easily-deployable, sensitive, rapid, and cost-effective tablet-based tests to be used as cognitive digital biomarkers by future clinical trials to help enable the development of new efficacious treatments for Alzheimer’s disease. The short testing time and ease of use of the technology could also enable primary care providers to detect individuals most at-risk for preclinical Alzheimer’s disease and other related dementias.",Development and validation of novel tests in the DCT drawing analysis platform for the detection of Alzheimer’s Disease-related early cognitive impairment,9909246,R43AG066291,"['Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Motion ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' τ Proteins ', ' tau factor ', ' tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' tau Proteins ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Therapeutic Agents ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Visit ', ' processing speed ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' HIPAA ', ' Structure ', ' memory process ', ' memory processing ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' cognitive change ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' digital ', ' cost effective ', ' Impairment ', ' input device ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' Alzheimer disease detection ', ' AD detection ', ' information processing ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' stability testing ', ' signal processing ', ' cloud based ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' demented ', ' recruit ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' Infrastructure ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' ']",NIA,"DIGITAL COGNITION TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2019,120723,0.2025219479230142
"Decoding the regulatory architecture across brain cell types in Alzheimer's Disease In this supplement to our ENCODE4 project, we will analyze functional genomics data from up to 7 major brain regions in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients and healthy controls. These data include both bulk tissue and single cell assays. We will use these data to generate brain cell-type specific regulatory maps in AD cases and controls, and to understand the processes of dysregulation in AD. We will additionally use these data, supplemented with public data, to identify critical cell types for AD progression, causal variants, target genes and regulatory networks in AD cases and controls. Finally, we will validate regulatory variants using MPRAs and CRISPR experiments in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. In summary, this supplement will enable us to provide high-resolution maps of chromatin function and healthy and diseased brains, and to link disease-associated variants to likely functional roles.

"A machine learning approach to increasing diagnostic accuracy in Atypical Alzheimer's disease cases with clinical-radiological mismatch Project Summary Machine-learning (ML) approaches have been applied for automatic diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). These studies use highly variable training and testing datasets and consequently confound objective comparison of classification between methodologies because of differences between datasets, feature extraction, feature selection, and validation methods. The hypothesis of this proposed project is that advanced ML co-analysis of commonly used MRI imaging and neuropsychological information may hold potential for improved hard-to-detect AD diagnosis. This study proposes a fully automated two-step AD diagnosis framework for patients with dementia through the following Specific Aims:  Aim 1: To discover volumetric MRI imaging biomarkers for dementia by studying feature-based  multiresolution-fractal texture extraction, Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) multiclass feature selection,  and fusion with feature-less deep ML methods. In this Aim, we will design hand-crafted MRI features and  featureless deep learning methods to obtain imaging features. Multi-class KLD will be developed to select  and fuse different features to generate MRI biomarkers.  Aim 2: To combine advanced regression based feature fusion and prediction for MRI biomarkers and  neuropsychological information informant history, AD risk factors, and functional status for accurate and  hard-to-detect AD classification. This Aim systematically fuses the newly discovered MRI imaging  biomarkers with a battery of non-imaging features to target the atypical AD cases where volumetry and  neuropsychological testing alone may not yield AD detection. This will help to reduce the number of patients that will need referral for further more expensive PET imaging for diagnosis of AD. Project Narrative There is need to understand the effect of combining feature-guided deep Magnetic Resonance Imaging with other data, such as neurophysiological data, informant history, Alzheimer's dementia risk factors, and functional status, for accurate diagnosis of atypical Alzheimer's Dementia cases. Early intervention has the potential to improve the quality of life of such patients.

"Identification and Characterization of Common Pathways across Alzheimer Disease Genotypes using a Multiomic Approach Alzheimer disease (AD) is a multigenic and multifactorial condition with a common pathological hallmark, deposition of Aβ and tau proteins aggregates in the brain. A few genes have been directly involved in the protein deposition metabolism. Another 24 loci have been identified as risk factors for AD which have shed light into other impaired mechanisms. There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how all these pathways are interrelated towards a same ending phenotype. Omic technologies have been instrumental in complementing our understanding of the pathways involved between disruption of particular loci and final pathology. However, each one of these studies only explains a modest portion of the pathology of AD, whilst complex diseases involve a highly dynamic and interactive system of molecular layers. The central hypothesis is that different molecular layers are interconnected in AD so that the dysregulation of any of these causes the ultimate AD phenotype (Aβ and tau proteins aggregates). Multi-omic analysis can provide an insight into how different molecular dimensions interact with each other, an insight that single omic data cannot provide. Also, there is limited availability of multi-omic data collected on the same group of individuals and tissue. The objective of this project is to identify dysregulated pathways consistent across molecilar layers. In the K99 phase of the award, I plan to generate single-omic profiles (transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic) from brain tissue from highly characterized individuals. I will also leverage existing GWAs data for these individuals to conduct pair-wise integrative analysis to identify common variants that act as genetic regulators (QTL) for the identified dysregulated molecular markers. To conduct these analyses, I will gain training in network and pathway analysis, but also in big data and machine learning methods. During this period, I will also receive training in handling of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSc) and in functional analysis. Preliminary analysis using transcriptomic data have identified AGFG2 gene to be overexpressed across AD etiologies compared to controls. AGFG2 is an astrocyte expressed gene that seems to be involved in Aβ metabolism. During the K99 phase I will examine the role of AGFG2 in iPSC-derived astrocytes from AD patients' carriers of known pathogenic mutations (ADAD). Having acquired this knowledge, during the R00 phase I will explore whether dysregulation of AGFG2 has the same effect in ADAD as in iPSC-derived astrocytes from early onset and late onset AD patients. Finally, I will elevate the pair-wise integration of omic data to a meta-dimensional level. This will allow me to identify molecular signals (transcripts, proteins, metabolites) that are consistent across molecular layers. If successful, this project has the potential to reveal novel insights of AD biology, which will be of interest to the scientific community. In addition, with this award I will develop a translational profile which will be invaluable for establishing me as an independent investigator in the growing field of systems biology. Project Narrative This study will use multi-omic data from brain tissue from Alzheimer disease (AD) cases and healthy individuals to identify biological abnormalities that are consistent across molecular layers which will be validated on iPSc. The results will reveal novel understanding of AD and point to new therapeutic targets.",Identification and Characterization of Common Pathways across Alzheimer Disease Genotypes using a Multiomic

"Personalized Combination Therapy for AD with Common Comorbidities Project summary Our goal is to develop artificial intelligent (AI) analytics models to facilitate personalized treatment plans for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients with most common comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM) and depression. AD is a neurodegenerative disease that progressively causes memory loss and cognitive impairment. While current treatments have shown some amelioration of symptoms, the effects have been transient and limited to a small percentage of patients. Moreover, disease-modifying drugs based on our current understanding of disease mechanisms have all shown negative results in clinical trials. Part of the failure is due to the heterogeneity in the disease mechanism, of which we do not yet have a clear understanding. Additionally, increasing evidence has indicated that comorbidities of AD share common disease pathways with AD, and medications used for these diseases may also alter the cognitive functions in AD patients. However, few studies have assessed combinations of these medications in treatments for AD. In this study, we will address this problem by retrospectively analyzing the observational data collected by the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC). In Aim 1, we plan to statistically investigate the effects of different medications when used in combination with anti-AD medications on the trajectory of cognitive decline. If specific drug combination(s) are found to have a potential synergistic effect against cognitive decline, we will further study the underlying mechanisms using molecular systems pharmacology methods in Aim 2. In Aim 3, we will focus on establishing a clinical decision support system that facilitates individualized treatment for AD patients with these common comorbidities. We will build a Bayesian Network model that can predict the disease progression based patient and treatment information provided by the ADRC data set. The model will be learned and tested based on the ADRC dataset using the Tetrad software package. We will then apply methodologies of decision theory and search for a treatment combination that leads to the optimal treatment outcomes for specific patients. Collectively, these studies will contribute to a discovery of novel drug combinations for treating AD patients with comorbidities, and generate ideas for a clinical decision support system that can facilitate personalized medicine for these patients. Project Narrative Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, and cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and depression are most prevalent coexisting medical conditions in AD patients. Researchers from University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy and School of Medicine plan to analyze the medication history of AD patients to find better treatments for AD patients with those comorbidities and to study the molecular mechanisms with advanced computational approaches. Ultimately, the studies will contribute to discover effective combination therapies for AD patients.",Personalized Combination Therapy for AD with Common

"Development of Ryan Companion Robot for Assisting Elderly People with Alzheimer's Disease The objective of the proposed Fast-Track SBIR effort is to develop and commercialize the Ryan CompanionBot (hereafter, Ryan), an intelligent conversational life-like social robot, designed to improve the well-being and quality of life of older adults with early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementia (ADRD). According to the NIA, research reports estimate that as many as 5.1 million Americans may have AD, and the number is expected to rise as the population ages. Common symptoms of AD/ADRD include cognitive decline, short-term memory loss, changes in mood, depression, communication difficulties, lost interest in hobbies or activities, and repetitive behavior. Americans suffering from AD/ADRD are believed to cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Traditional methods for disease management have shown limited success treating AD/ADRD or mitigating its symptoms. Health care personnel and caregivers who are physically and emotionally taxed are seeking new ways to provide care for elderly individuals and particularly those suffering from AD/ADRD. Innovative technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, have begun to alleviate the growing need for novel solutions to the healthcare. Among such technologies, socially assistive robots such as Ryan have received a great amount of attention in recent years. Ryan will be designed to promote social interaction and foster engagement and rapport, and improve mood and well-being of persons with early stage AD/ADRD. In the Phase I effort, we will develop facial emotion recognition technology and integrate it with Ryan and then conduct a pilot study to understand the feasiblity and effectiveness of Ryan in fostering empathy and rapport in interaction with persons with AD/ADRD. Once validated, we will work with domain experts to design and build aestehcically pleasing Ryan V2.0 and integrate the facial expression recognition technology with a spoken- dialog system, reminders, and other intelligent features into Ryan to address the needs of persons with early stage AD/ADRD and their caregivers. If successful, DreamFace will be positioned to bring to market an affordable and effective socially-assistive robot to improve the quality of life for persons with AD/ADRD. The goal of the project is to develop a socially assistive robot companionbot (Ryan) for improving the quality of life of persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Americans suffering from AD cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Successful development of Ryan will improve patient well-being, make caregivers more efficient and effective, and provide significant financial benefits to the healthcare industry, and assist families and caregivers who are looking for ways to better assist older adults with AD.",Development of Ryan Companion Robot for Assisting Elderly People with Alzheimer's Disease,9950170,R44AG059483,"['Age ',

"Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS) Project Summary While the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increases with advancing age, approximately 5% of AD patients develop symptoms before age 65 (~280,000 Americans). The vast majority (90%-95%) of EOAD patients do not have a known mutation in APP or PSEN1/2, and only ~50% are APOE4 carriers. Unlike late-onset AD (LOAD), 30-64% of EOAD have non-amnestic presentations, leading to missed or delayed diagnosis. Despite being highly motivated and having few comorbidities, EOAD patients are commonly excluded from large scale observational biomarker studies (e.g. ADNI and DIAN) and therapeutic trials due to their young age, non- amnestic deficits, or absence of known pathogenic mutations. Furthermore, studies suggest high heritability in EOAD in the absence of known mutations or APOE4, signifying that this population may be enriched for novel genetic risk factors. Emerging biomarkers of amyloid and tau have not been systematically characterized in this population. Clinical and neuroimaging measures employed in LOAD may be insensitive to baseline deficits and disease progression in EOAD, which predominantly involve non-memory cognitive domains and posterior cortical neurodegeneration. To fill this gap in AD research, we plan to recruit and longitudinally follow 400 amyloid PET- positive EOAD subjects meeting NIA-AA criteria for MCI due to AD or probable AD dementia (including primary amnestic, dysexecutive, language and visuospatial presentations) and 100 age-matched controls. Participants in the Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease Study (LEADS) will undergo clinical assessments, psychometric testing, MRI, amyloid ([18F]Florbetaben) and tau ([18F]AV1451) PET, CSF and blood draw for collection of DNA, RNA, plasma, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Patients will be assessed at three time points – baseline (both EOAD and controls), 12 months (EOAD all measures; controls – clinical and cognitive measures only) and 24 months (EOAD, all measures except PET). Methods will be harmonized with ADNI and DIAN. We will comprehensively characterize cognitive, imaging and biofluid changes over time in EOAD, and compare to a matched sample of LOAD participants identified in ADNI. We will employ machine learning algorithms to develop sensitive clinical and imaging measures of EOAD progression. An exploratory aim will apply next generation sequencing to assess for novel genetic risk factors for disease. The study will also establish a network of EOAD research sites and set the stage for the launch of clinical trials in this population. Project Narrative Patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD), occurring before age 65, are an understudied segment of the population of patients with AD, and many treatment studies exclude these younger individuals. In this project, we plan to recruit and follow more than 400 people with EOAD in order to better understand changes in thinking abilities, changes in the brain, and changes in blood and spinal fluid, with the goal of using this information to design new treatment trials inclusive of this segment of the AD population.",Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS),9912388,U01AG057195,"['Age ',

"Dementia Screening Using Automated Speech Analysis: A Pilot Study Project Summary Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is vital if treatments are to be most effective, yet for myriad reasons, a staggering number of older Americans do not receive diagnostic services. Recent technological breakthroughs show considerable promise to identify biomarkers for AD, but nonetheless still require costly and often invasive in-person testing. What is needed is a new approach that can rival current technologies in terms of diagnostic accuracy, while also permitting wider accessibility and economy. The ubiquitous telephone will be the vehicle for this approach in the proposed study. Telephone-based diagnostic screening tests have emerged as a viable alternative to in-person testing, and appear well tolerated and cost-effective. These tests are effective at detecting frank dementia, yet lack sensitivity to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) a likely risk factor for AD. Deficits in language function, particularly semantic knowledge, are characteristic of AD, and these changes may occur decades prior to the emergence of overt symptoms. Research from our group has demonstrated that automated speech analysis can quantify aspects of semantic knowledge in psychiatric samples and can provide similar information to human raters in terms of diagnostic accuracy. Hence, our goal is to determine the acceptability, sensitivity and specificity of an automated speech analysis approach to the detection of AD and MCI from speech samples elicited via telephone. Such an approach has the potential to greatly outperform current screening methods, not only in terms of sensitivity to cognitive decline, but also accessibility, cost, and user satisfaction. If successful, this project could form an integral part of an adaptive, machine learning decision support system to accurately predict an individual's dementia conversion threshold and trajectory of decline.

"Alzheimer's Gut Microbiome Project ABSTRACT – Overall Behavioral, emotional and cognitive disorders have been historically studied as diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). However, emerging data suggests a gut-brain connection in a variety of diseases that affect the brain. Our own data and others’ suggests a gut-brain connection in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is the leading cause of dementia. There are currently no therapies to prevent or slow AD progression, causing a huge socioeconomic burden and highlighting our incomplete knowledge. Given an emerging role for gut microbiome and hypotheses implicating viral and bacterial contributions to AD pathogenesis, defining the bidirectional biochemical communication between the brain and the gut will improve understanding of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. Indeed, it is crucial to study the brain not in isolation, but in the context of peripheral influences including diet, lifestyle, and microbiome. In this proposal we build on large initiatives and infrastructures co-established by our multi-disciplinary team including: The American Gut Project, The AD Metabolomics Consortium, Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs), National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD), The National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) and centers of excellence in informatics and systems biology. We aim to define the role of gut microbiome in AD pathogenesis and biochemical axis of communication between gut and brain. Aim 1: Examine the association between the gut microbiome and AD phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the biochemical axis of communication between the gut microbiome and the brain and identify metabolites that contribute to AD endophenotypes. Aim 3: Examine mechanistic links between the activity of the gut microbiome and AD pathogenesis, and identify new approaches for AD prevention that target the gut-brain axis. These aims will be enabled three projects supported by an Omics and Technology Core, a Computational and Systems Biology Core, and an Administrative Core that provides data and biorepository infrastructure. Project 1 will define changes in gut microbiome and metabolome across the AD trajectory; Project 2 leverages three existing clinical trials of controlled diets to examine dietary effects on gut microbiome, metabolome, cognition and brain imaging; Project 3 examines mechanism by defining gut- brain communication and microbiome-based interventions in animal models of AD. In this U19 we will create an unprecedented, high-quality dataset and resources specifically for the AD research community, and make these available under open science, FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data principles. With our cross-disciplinary team of experts in clinical AD, gut microbiome research, imaging, metabolomics, informatics, deep learning and systems biology, this effort will yield novel biomarkers for AD progression and prognosis, and insight into mechanisms opening the door to development of transformative options for AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE – Overall Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurological disease in the US and evidence suggests that genetics, gut bacteria, diet, lifestyle, and environmental exposures contribute to human metabolism and its dysregulation in diseases including AD. Gut-brain biochemical axis are being identified and seem implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders like AD. Understanding how different diets can prevent or reverse AD, and targets that could be delivered microbioiologically or pharmacologically to persons who cannot or will not change their diet, is an important long-term goal in AD research, especially given the emerging understanding that responses to diet are highly individualized and dependent on the microbiome. The goal of the current project is to define the gut-brain-chemical axis of communication of the role of the gut microbiome in AD pathogenesis.",Alzheimer's Gut Microbiome

"Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS) Project Summary While the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increases with advancing age, approximately 5% of AD patients develop symptoms before age 65 (~280,000 Americans). The vast majority (90%-95%) of EOAD patients do not have a known mutation in APP or PSEN1/2, and only ~50% are APOE4 carriers. Unlike late-onset AD (LOAD), 30-64% of EOAD have non-amnestic presentations, leading to missed or delayed diagnosis. Despite being highly motivated and having few comorbidities, EOAD patients are commonly excluded from large scale observational biomarker studies (e.g. ADNI and DIAN) and therapeutic trials due to their young age, non- amnestic deficits, or absence of known pathogenic mutations. Furthermore, studies suggest high heritability in EOAD in the absence of known mutations or APOE4, signifying that this population may be enriched for novel genetic risk factors. Emerging biomarkers of amyloid and tau have not been systematically characterized in this population. Clinical and neuroimaging measures employed in LOAD may be insensitive to baseline deficits and disease progression in EOAD, which predominantly involve non-memory cognitive domains and posterior cortical neurodegeneration. To fill this gap in AD research, we plan to recruit and longitudinally follow 400 amyloid PET- positive EOAD subjects meeting NIA-AA criteria for MCI due to AD or probable AD dementia (including primary amnestic, dysexecutive, language and visuospatial presentations) and 100 age-matched controls. Participants in the Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease Study (LEADS) will undergo clinical assessments, psychometric testing, MRI, amyloid ([18F]Florbetaben) and tau ([18F]AV1451) PET, CSF and blood draw for collection of DNA, RNA, plasma, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Patients will be assessed at three time points – baseline (both EOAD and controls), 12 months (EOAD all measures; controls – clinical and cognitive measures only) and 24 months (EOAD, all measures except PET). Methods will be harmonized with ADNI and DIAN. We will comprehensively characterize cognitive, imaging and biofluid changes over time in EOAD, and compare to a matched sample of LOAD participants identified in ADNI. We will employ machine learning algorithms to develop sensitive clinical and imaging measures of EOAD progression. An exploratory aim will apply next generation sequencing to assess for novel genetic risk factors for disease. The study will also establish a network of EOAD research sites and set the stage for the launch of clinical trials in this population. Project Narrative Patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD), occurring before age 65, are an understudied segment of the population of patients with AD, and many treatment studies exclude these younger individuals. In this project, we plan to recruit and follow more than 400 people with EOAD in order to better understand changes in thinking abilities, changes in the brain, and changes in blood and spinal fluid, with the goal of using this information to design new treatment trials inclusive of this segment of the AD population.",Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS),9788208,U01AG057195,"['Age ',

"Interpretable Machine Learning to Identify Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutic Targets Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an urgent national and international research priority. Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the hallmark of AD. Their building blocks are Amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, respectively. At present, we lack an understanding of the set of genes that affect formation of plaques and tangles along with protective and pathological responses to these toxic peptides. Biologists are now gathering gene expression data and Aβ and tau measures from human brain tissues. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (here, gene expression levels) that best predict an outcome (Aβ or tau level). The identified features, biomarkers, can help determine the molecular basis for plaques and tangles. Unfortunately, false positive biomarkers are very common, as evidenced by low success rates of replication in independent data and low success reaching clinical practice (less than 1%). We seek to radically shift the current paradigm in biomarker discovery by resolving three fundamental problems with the current approach using novel, theoretically well-founded machine learning (ML) methods to learn interpretable models from data. Aim 1. Learn an interpretable feature representation from publicly available, high-throughput brain data. High-dimensionality, hidden variables, and complex feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., observed statistical associations) and true biological interactions. To increase the chance to identify true positive biomarkers, we need new feature selection criteria to learn a model that better explains rather than simply predicts the outcome. To do so, our proposed ML algorithms will identify the genes that are likely to give a meaningful explanation of the outcome (Aβ or tau level) by inferring both the functions of genes in the cellular processes contributing to AD and the gene interaction network from many existing brain datasets. Aim 2. Make interpretable predictions using a unified framework to explain model predictions. Due to disease heterogeneity, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) often more accurately describe relationships between genes and an outcome than simpler, linear models, but lack interpretability. We will develop a novel ML framework that interprets complex model predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a specific prediction, which will identify features of high importance for each individual as personalized markers and classify subjects based on these importance estimates. Aim 3. Validate the identified candidate biomarkers using powerful worm models of AD. Analyzing observational data without doing interventional experiments cannot prove causal relationships. In collaboration with co-I Matt Kaeberlein, we will utilize powerful nematode models of AD to test our hypotheses on the role of certain genes as disease modifiers, and develop a new way to refine the models based on this knowledge. Successful completion of this project will result in previously unknown molecular basis for Aβ and tau levels, potential therapeutic targets, and general ML techniques widely applicable to many other data science problems. Project Narrative In the United States alone, someone receives an Alzheimer’s diagnosis every 66 seconds, and the disease has become the 6th leading cause of death in this country; Alzheimer’s disease (AD) currently has no cure, no prevention, and no treatment to reverse or halt its deadly progression. The recent, rapid growth of gene expression data from human brain tissues hold great promise for identifying therapeutic targets, but extremely low success rates to identify true positive biomarkers indicate fundamental problems with the current computational approach being used. We seek to revolutionize the way we identify drug targets by developing novel machine learning techniques that extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data, combined with biological validation in an animal model of AD.",Interpretable Machine Learning to Identify Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutic Targets,9639494,R01AG061132,"['Peptides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' social

"The Longitudinal Course O\F Imaging Biomarkers in People At RISK of AD The goal of this ongoing R01 is to chart the progression of pathobiologic markers of presymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and their effect on neural function and cognition in a late-middle-aged cohort enriched with risk for AD. There is an appreciable gap in knowledge about the temporal disease course in this age range that this ongoing project has been directly addressing with serial multimodal imaging including amyloid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection, and serial cognitive measurement. In the next funding cycle we will add a new positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technique sensitive to fibrillar tau [F-18]THK5351 indexing neurofibrillary pathology. In the prior funding period we recruited 179 individuals from a registry of 1,545 people at risk for AD known as WRAP (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention). We found that [C-11]PIB amyloid burden is detectable in 20% of people with parental history of AD at a mean age of 60. Baseline amyloid is more extensive in the presence of higher CSF total tau levels, and 2-year increases in PiB amyloid are significantly predicted by higher baseline CSF tau. The hypothesis for this renewal is that tau- related neurofibrillar pathology begins early (in accord with the neuropathology literature) in people at AD risk and its strategic spatial burden explains changes in amyloid, neural function and cognitive decline. Aim 1: To test the premise that amyloid burden is necessary but not sufficient to evoke preclinical cognitive change. We will examine effects of longitudinal amyloid and tau change on episodic memory trajectories over time in 235 at risk individuals including all subjects we previously enrolled and follow them over 2 years with advanced multimodal imaging and CSF. Aim 2: To assess the effects of tau and amyloid imaging on MRI and CSF indicators of neural injury and function. Aim 3: To develop a multimodal disease marker to maximize efficiency of clinical trials in preclinical AD. Following our work in creating tools for efficient clinical trials in MCI, we will extend these concepts to the pre-MCI phase of disease utilizing deep learning architectures with tau, amyloid and structural imaging inputs. We will also examine change over time in tau, amyloid and cognition as outcomes. As any of these features considered singularly may be affected by age, and as amyloid and tau may be `necessary but not sufficient' by themselves, a derived multimodal marker may have eventual clinical utility in enriching prevention trials with those most likely to progress, and increasing power to detect change attributable to preclinical interventions. Significance: Relative tau and amyloid imaging profiles have not been empirically established in the presymptomatic time frame and this information is urgently needed to identify incipient disease. No comparable studies exist regarding the evolution of tau and amyloid signal in the critical late-middle-age time frame of preclinical AD. This ongoing project represents a unique opportunity to examine the earliest determinants of AD progression, when treatments may be most meaningful.

"Quantifying Brain Abnormality by Multimodality Neuroimage Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops for an unknown and variable amount of time before its symptoms fully manifest. But, when the symptoms become clinically observable, a significant neurodegeneration has already taken place. Thus, there is a largely unmet need for technologies that can aid the effective early diagnosis and prognosis of AD in an in vivo and more objective manner. The goal of this renewal project is to develop a set of advanced machine-learning techniques for precise in vivo quantification of pathological changes of brains with multimodality neuroimaging for both early diagnosis and prognosis of AD. AD is a highly heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with complex pathophysiology, thus very challenging to pinpoint its subtle pathologies without any aid from advanced computational technologies. To this end, we propose the following four specific aims to identify those subtle disease-induced alterations, derive robust diagnostic conclusions, and predict future disease trajectories. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop a multi-view feature representation technique to robustly extract complementary information from neuroimaging data with multiple representative atlases, and then identify a small subset of most discriminative features for AD diagnosis. This novel multi-atlas technique will deviate from the conventional single-atlas approaches in feature representation, which are often susceptible to inter-subject structural variability, registration error, and atlas selection bias. In Aim 2, we will further devlop two novel multi-view feature mapping techniques for collaborative fusion of multimodality information by explicitly considering the distribution heterogeneity of different categories of features extracted from different modalities. This will significantly avoid the unnecessary complexity of feature distributions after our collaborative fusion, thus increasing the efficacy of subsequent diagnostic classifiers. Specifically, a deep learning technique (with deep multi-layered architecture) will be adopted to hierarchically mine multimodality information that resides nonlinearly both within each modality and between different modalities. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-task sparse learning technique for joint prediction of diagnostic status and clinical scores (e.g., ADAS-Cog and MMSE) by considering the inherent correlations between features and between training samples. This will also allow us to exploit the latent structure underlying the data for robust estimation of these highly variable clinical scores. Finally, in Aim 4, we will jointly predict clinical scores of each given subject in multiple future time points, by developing coupled random forests that can take advantage of all training subjects with complete or even incomplete multimodality data and further enforce temporal consistency of those estimated clinical scores.  All the above-proposed techniques will be evaluated by a large image set of elderly subjects in ADNI. We expect that the successful completion of this renewal project will result in a comprehensive and effective diagnosis/prognosis framework for improving early detection of AD. The respective software tools will be released freely to the research community, as we have done with our HAMMER software, which has been downloaded by >5200 users from >20 countries.

"Naturalistic Event Representation as a Novel Biomarker of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease By 2060, the number of Americans 65 and older is projected to more than double from 46 million to 98 million, 24% of the total population. With this comes an increased prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which will create significant burden on our society and government. At present, screening tools capable of differentiating healthy aging from AD are most effective a decade or more after the preclinical stage, when potential treatments would be most effective. Thus, discovery of novel and specific tools for assessing the aging brain are of utmost importance. Typical studies of cognitive ability involve recognition of learned objects or simple word associations. However, in real-world situations, the content of an event is segmented from a flow of multimodal information. Segmentation and representation of events is supported by a posterior-medial network (PMN) of brain areas. Critically, this very same brain network features the first regions affected by pathological accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ), a key characteristic of AD. A recent report from an NIA working group defined asymptomatic Aβ accumulation as the earliest indicator of preclinical AD. Given the functional role of the PMN, we propose that this stage of disease may not be truly asymptomatic: subtle functional deficits may be evident if properly probed. To address this, we have developed a naturalistic paradigm to characterize event representation in the brain and subsequent memory. We aim to test the novel hypotheses that the brain’s ability to segment and represent complex events is compromised in preclinical AD, and that the extent of this disruption is predictive of deficient memory for the experienced events. We will acquire functional MRI (fMRI) scans while participants view a video narrative depicting naturalistic scenarios. We will additionally test memory performance related to details of the events depicted in the video both in and out of the scanner. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA) and machine learning analyses of functional MRI (fMRI) data, we will examine differences in the way the brain represents events into advanced aging in participants with and without ‘asymptomatic’ amyloid deposition (status obtained via existing PET scan data). This combination of approaches is highly innovative because current translational measures do not assess memory for rich, dynamic events that make up the majority of real-world experience. This project is expected to significantly improve our understanding of neural and cognitive disruptions that differentiate healthy aging from preclinical AD. By studying how the brain chunks and represents events, and how this relates to memory for those events, we can reveal significant insights into the way AD-related pathology affects day-to-day living. This can provide a mechanistic framework for understanding subtle, subjective memory complaints. The results of this work are anticipated to significantly advance our understanding of memory decline in the earliest possible stages of AD, providing a mechanistic basis for subtle issues that have to date been difficult to assess in the clinic. The ability to parse and represent complex events is a cornerstone of cognition and memory, and is dramatically affected by Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The goal of this project is to use brain imaging and behavioral tests to understand how neural event representations are impacted by preclinical AD compared to healthy aging. The results will help us to understand early differences between healthy aging and AD, and it will help clinicians to develop novel screening tools.",Naturalistic Event Representation as a Novel Biomarker of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease,9737104,R03AG063224,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cognition ', ' Amyloid deposition ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Pathology ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' Television ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' amyloid-b protein ', ' amyloid beta ', ' abeta ', ' a beta peptide ', ' Aβ ', ' Amyloid β-Protein ', ' Amyloid β-Peptide ', ' Amyloid β ', ' Amyloid Protein A4 ', ' Amyloid Beta-Peptide ', "" Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein "", "" Alzheimer's amyloid "", "" Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein "", ' Alzheimer beta-Protein ', ' Amyloid beta-Protein ', ' Measures ', ' improved ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Memory impairment ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Senile Plaques ', ' diffuse plaque ', ' cored plaque ', ' aβ plaques ', ' amyloid-b plaque ', ' amyloid beta plaque ', ' Neuritic Plaques ', ' Amyloid Plaques ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Stream ', ' Clinic ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Episodic memory ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' movie ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Reporting ', ' Age-Related Memory Disorders ', ' Memory Disorders of the Elderly ', ' Memory Loss ', ' memory decline ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' abeta deposition ', ' aβ deposition ', ' amyloid β deposition ', ' amyloid beta deposition ', ' aging brain ', ' aged brain ', ' abeta accumulation ', ' aβ aggregation ', ' aβ accumulation ', ' amyloid β aggregation ', ' amyloid β accumulation ', ' amyloid beta aggregation ', ' amyloid beta accumulation ', ' abeta aggregation ', ' healthy aging ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' neural patterning ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive ability ', ' functional MRI scan ', ' fMRI scan ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2019,157000,0.17093686621448664
"Using connectomics to characterize risk for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION The prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years. While research efforts continue to focus on the causes of AD and to develop effective medical treatments, there is also a pressing need to characterize risk for AD before the disease is diagnosed. There may be subtle changes in brain and cognitive function that are detectable before major symptoms emerge. One approach for characterizing these vulnerabilities is the use of functional and structural neuroimaging to identify risk profiles for AD. The present study proposes and tests a model of AD pathology using neuroimaging network analysis and machine learning approaches to provide insight on widespread changes in information processing in the AD brain. The proposed model hypothesizes that some aspects of network information processing reflect neurodegeneration and cognitive decline associated with AD pathology (e.g., hub connectivity and global connectivity) whereas other network properties reflect attempts to compensate for compromised information processing (e.g., diffusion of information). In addition, this proposal compares the efficacy of models with respect to discriminating diagnostic categories (e.g., machine learning classification of AD and clinically normal subjects) versus isolating underlying dimensions of AD cognitive decline (e.g., machine learning prediction of memory and language scores from network features). Finally, this study will determine whether features of AD pathology are present in an at-risk sample of subjects; namely, individuals diagnosed with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). This will be examined by transferring the AD network models to aMCI subjects and testing whether the model can discriminate aMCI from clinically normal matched controls and whether the model can predict scores on cognitive tests. The analytic approach will using resting state fMRI data as a primary assay of network integrity, but diffusion imaging and task fMRI data will also be examined in an exploratory aim. The general approach will recruit individuals with AD, aMCI and clinically normal matched controls for each diagnostic group. The groups that are compared directly will be matched for amyloid status, as indicated by florbetapir PET imaging. The novel contributions of this project include (a) testing a network model of AD pathology that unifies various measures of network functioning, (b) comparing efficacy of modeling with respect to delineating diagnostic categories versus capturing underlying cognitive dimensions of AD, and (c) transferring the AD model to an at-risk group to assess disease vulnerability. This latter innovation can be applied in future studies to any group of subjects that is defined at risk, such as those with genetic vulnerability or positive family history. The present study also sets the stage for a subsequent longitudinal follow-up study to validate whether individuals identified at risk using network modeling actually convert to AD. Ultimately, network modeling of this sort may be used as a relatively less expensive and less invasive biomarker than PET imaging, which could lead to earlier treatments and interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE With the prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years, there is a pressing need to characterize risk for AD before the disease is diagnosed. The present study will use neuroimaging to examine brain connectivity and determine whether some aspects of altered connectivity are present in individuals who are at risk for AD: individuals who have mild cognitive impairment. This approach could be used in the future to possibly detect risk for AD before any cognitive symptoms emerge, thereby enabling earlier treatment and intervention to combat the devastating cognitive,

"Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease Resubmission 1 R01 AG058687-01 PI: Adriana Seelye, Ph.D. Project Summary. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease and their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and to reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. Project Objectives. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to objectively assess high-level IADL functioning in a new way that will more effectively identify the earliest subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence. The specific aims for this research are: Aim 1 will establish the most robust remotely monitored IADL variables and combinations of variables to discriminate between MCI and intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC using cross-sectional analyses. Aim 2 will determine the discriminatory ability of the new remotely monitored IADL variables compared to available IADL questionnaires to differentiate those with MCI relative to those with intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC in cross-sectional analyses. Aim 3 will identify and characterize the longitudinal trajectories (slopes) of remotely monitored IADL functioning over time between those with intact cognition and those with MCI using generalized linear mixed effects models, with person-specific IADL distributions and their changes as outcomes. Project Methods. The proposed project will apply innovative computing and ambient sensing technologies directly in participants' home and community environments to objectively assess IADL performance and variability among older adults with and without MCI in multiple clinically relevant functional domains for up to 4 years. Study involvement will also include annual neuropsychological and clinical testing. Machine learning computational approaches will be used to examine a large number of sensor-based IADL candidate variables generated through this study to determine the relative importance of these variables for discriminating between MCI and intact cognition groups, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Project Impact. The approaches used in this study will allow researchers, physicians, and caregivers to proactively identify and monitor increasing risks for deteriorating cognitive function (progressing from normal aging to MCI and from MCI to AD) in a way that is not currently possible, transforming AD prevention trials and significantly reducing the cost and consequences of functional decline in our aging population.

We will determine the high dimensional cellular and subcellular protein-level expression, interaction, and localization for AD-relevant molecules identified by genomic and proteomic studies in resilience and pathologic states using human brain sections from an ongoing proteomic investigation of AD. We hypothesize that in-depth, stage-specific phenotypic signatures extracted from these unique groups will provide insight into the modifiable factors that endorse the protective mechanisms of brain reserve. We will test our hypothesis through three Specific Aims: (1) Establish a subcellular, phenotypic framework of vulnerable and resistant brain areas. Next-generation MIBI equipment will be used to rigorously image 30+ proteins simultaneously; targets marking subtypes of neurons, synapses, non-neuronal cells, neuro-inflammatory, and vascular components will be concurrently measured. (2) Reveal cognitive resilience multiplexed phenotypes. Using approaches we have successfully applied in other single cell studies, we will analyze multiplexed imaging data with statistical deep learning methods already established in our lab to identify topological, cellular, and molecular phenotypic differences among resilient, co- morbid, and AD dementia. (3) Implement a shared data repository. The power of multiplexed imaging in biology is its ability to reveal co-localization or mutual exclusivity to infer regulatory roles and gain mechanistic insight. To disseminate hundreds of these images from our proposed highly multiplexed study, we will create a web-based portal, using already established infrastructure, where all of the images from this study can be accessed, multi-color overlays generated ad hoc, and all the features will be shared freely. PROJECT NARRATIVE AD is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the aging American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. Such signatures will provide insight into the modifiable factors that endorse the protective mechanisms of brain reserve. Such insights will illuminate pathways that hold potential for new therapeutic targets, as well as create a shared research resource and analysis platform for the community of scientists committed to developing solutions for AD.",MIRIAD - Multiplexed Imaging of Resilience In Alzheimers Disease,9756278,R01AG057915,"['insight ', ' Individual ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Spectrometry, Mass,

"Novel whole-genome analysis methods for Alzheimer's risk prediction Project Summary/Abstract  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects millions of Americans, yet there are no treatments that meaningfully affect disease progression once symptoms manifest. This has shifted the focus to early detection and intervention, which is thought by many researchers to offer the best chance of slowing or stopping the progression of AD. However, trials aimed at averting the underlying causes of disease have proven difficult because pathological changes in AD happen well in advance of cognitive decline. A widely-available genetic test for determining AD risk early in life, while prevention might still be possible, would allow early treatment intervention, enrollment in clinical trials, and improved patient stratification for testing treatment effectiveness. However, despite recent advancements, genetic risk prediction models (GRPMs) for late-onset AD (LOAD) lack sufficient discrimination ability to support such applications. Given the lack of effective treatments once symptoms have manifested and the socioeconomic consequences at stake, there is a serious unmet need for a widely-available GRPM able to accurately assess a patient's risk in middle age or earlier, before neurodegeneration begins.  To address this need, Parabon has teamed with AD researchers from Washington University and Emory to develop a GRPM able to accurately predict an individual's risk of developing LOAD at various ages. Phase I demonstrated that this GRPM, which exploits diagnostic heterogeneity, non-additive (epistatic) interactions among variants, and machine learning, significantly outperforms traditional risk factors. In Phase II, the GRPM will be further optimized, validated, and commercialized as a direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic health risk assessment test. In Aim 1, thousands of new and existing case and control subjects with genotypes and detailed phenotypes will be added. In Aim 2, novel approaches to feature selection for epistatic interactions will be implemented to increase the generalizability of selected features. In Aim 3, the selected genomic features will be used to predict imaging and biomarker endophenotypes of LOAD. In Aim 4, the out- of-sample endophenotype predictions will be combined into a final predictive model for AD diagnosis that can be applied to new subjects at any age, which will be validated in an independent replication set. Finally, in Aim 5, data and results will be prepared for scientific publication and submission to the FDA for marketing authorization as a DTC genetic health risk assessment system. Project Narrative Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects millions of Americans, yet there are no treatments that significantly slow disease progression once symptoms manifest, making early intervention crucial to reduce the individual and societal burden of this disease. This proposal seeks to create a genetic risk prediction model that can predict an individual's AD risk at any age, which will be made widely available as a direct-to-consumer genetic health risk assessment. It will enable early intervention and life planning for at-risk individuals and allow researchers to maximize the probability of detecting treatment effects in clinical trials by assessing patients' underlying disease risk.",Novel whole-genome analysis methods for Alzheimer's risk prediction,9786181,R44AG050366,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile

"Systematic Alzheimer's disease drug repositioning (SMART) based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening and image-omics PROJECT SUMMARY Given the complexity of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathogenesis and the associated co-morbid conditions, both the “depth” and the “width” of currently available drug repurposing solutions need to be improved in order to deliver effective AD therapeutic solutions. The depth of a drug-repurposing project refers to the level of understanding of disease mechanism and drug-target interactions across a wide searching space for the combination of dosage and treatment time. Achieving depth requires a reliable AD model system that comprehensively recapitulates AD pathogenesis in a human brain-like environment, and sophisticated transcriptomic profiles, which can reveal molecular-level changes underlying disease-reversing phenotypes across multiple treatment conditions. The width of a therapy search relies on the efficacy of predicting and validating effects of candidate compounds from an enormous search space. Width can be achieved from novel computational algorithms connecting –omics changes with phenotypic changes, thus guiding the search with improved knowledge on mechanisms and avoiding exhaustive testing of every available drug. Integrating the systems medicine and drug repositioning expertise of the Wong Lab at the Houston Methodist Research Institute of Houston Methodist Hospital with the Alzheimer's biology expertise of the Kim and Tanzi labs at Massachusetts General Hospital, we propose a SysteMatic Alzheimer's disease drug ReposiTioning (SMART) framework based on bioinformatics-guided phenotype screening. Reformatting a novel three- dimensional human neural stem cell culture model of AD (a.k.a. Alzheimer's in a dish) developed in the Kim and Tanzi labs for high content screening, the Wong lab screened 2,640 known drugs and bioactive compounds and obtained a panel of 38 primary hits that strongly inhibit β-amyloid-driven p-tau accumulation. We hypothesize that iteratively running relatively small screens with our novel 3D cell model and applying systematic artificial intelligence modeling to the transcriptomic profiles of the screening hits will allow us to: 1) quickly obtain a panel of robust novel drug candidates for AD, and 2) gain an in-depth understanding of disease mechanisms from those repositioned drug candidates, which will subsequently improve the success rate of predicting novel hits. Using the primary 38 hits as a starting point, the SMART computational modules will update the existing NeuriteIQ software package to quantify the image data from high content screening; it will also incorporate publicly available big data transcriptomic profiles to predict candidate compounds inducing similar pathway changes as those original compounds, effectively expanding the search width to tens of thousands of compounds while only requiring functional validation of less than 100 drug candidates. The validated predictions will, in turn, add to the panel of known hits that will launch the next round of computational predictions and experimental validations, efficiently generating candidates for novel AD therapies (Aim 1). SMART's iterative prediction-validation scheme effectively connects more transcriptomic profiles to desirable phenotypic changes. Thus, we will apply systematic image-omics modeling to uncover novel mechanisms driving such phenotypes. For all the validated hits, dose-responses for the phenotype of pTau inhibition will be obtained using the 3D culture model; while the dose-responses for individual genes and pathways will be modeled through public and in-house generated transcriptomic profiles. We will use Partial Least Square Regression models to identify gene modules with matching dose-response curves as the phenotypes, thus allowing us to go beyond the confinement of canonical pathway maps and identify novel functional modules specifically related to phenotypes of interest (Aim 2). Selected compounds derived from the previous two aims will be evaluated in human neurons directly derived from AD patients and in animal models (Aim 3). Success of this work will lead to new AD therapeutic compounds ready for translation into clinical trials, as well as a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the SMART framework for drug repositioning will be generalizable to other big data and disease platforms. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) Alzheimer's Disease (AD) currently afflicts 5.3 million people in the United States alone. Beyond symptomatic treatments, no clear therapeutic options are available. The proposed study provides a systematic drug repositioning strategy that uses a novel 3D human neural culture model (Alzheimer's-in-a-dish) integrated with a computational platform that leverages publicly available toxicology and pharmokinetic big data. Success of the study will greatly reduce the cost of AD drug development, identify potential new disease mechanism, and facilitate quicker translation from bench to bedside. .",Systematic Alzheimer's

"Center for Identification and Study of Individuals with Atypical Diabetes Mellitus (U54) Diabetes is traditionally classified in two broad categories: autoimmune Type 1 and obesity-related Type 2. Numerous phenotypically and etiologically distinct forms exist and are emerging, collectively termed “atypical diabetes” (AD), that do not fit into either category. We hypothesize that AD comprises a spectrum that includes numerous forms, both known (e.g, MODY/monogenic, Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults, Ketosis-Prone Diabetes) and unknown. We propose to establish the Center for Atypical Diabetes Research and Evaluation (CADRE). The goals of CADRE are to (1) identify and define comprehensively the forms of AD; and (2) establish an extensive database and repository of biosamples from AD patients. Defining the forms of AD is challenging because the etiology of AD can range from a single gene variant to a highly complex mixture of genetics, epigenetics and environmental factors. To identify patients with AD, and then to define the forms, we will use a two-pronged approach. Approach (a) will use clustering analysis of genotypic and phenotypic data from diverse groups of patients with diabetes. We have recruited 15 domestic and international population cohorts with data on more than 33,000 patients with diabetes. Further, we have recruited six diabetes study clinics (Baylor College of Medicine [BCM], University of Washington [UW], Indiana University [IU], Emory University, University of Colorado, and SUNY Downstate) who will prospectively recruit patients. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation will facilitate recruitment from patient groups. The Administrative Core at BCM will work with cohorts and clinics to obtain data. The University of South Florida (USF) will filter data for AD and separate patients into phenotypically homogenous clusters that can be diagnosed based on genetic and clinical features unique to the cluster. Approach (b) will identify monogenic, oligogenic and mitochondrial forms of AD from patients enrolled in genetics registries (BCM) and a family study with genetic data (Botnia). The BCM registries include patients referred to the Undiagnosed Disease Network. All patients will undergo whole-exome and mitochondrial genome sequencing (Cores at BCM), single-nucleotide polymorphism variant analysis (Oxford), metabolomic analysis (Duke) and phenotypic analysis of C-peptide, adiponectin, proinsulin, islet autoantibodies, and serum insulin DNA levels (Cores at UW and IU). To establish the database and biorepository, we will invite patients with AD to participate in sample donation and longitudinal follow-up via the cohorts and clinics. Data and samples will be transferred to the Database and Biorepository Core at USF, with input and tracking implemented using the successful framework developed by USF for large multicenter trials. Data will be made available through the NIDDK and a CADRE website and samples will be made available through ancillary study application. Ongoing patient recruitment to expand the database and biorepository will occur through the study clinics and clinician referral through the CADRE website. Overall, CADRE will be built on a foundation of existing, successful core facilities and computational systems to create a lasting resource that will substantially advance AD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE For many people with diabetes, their symptoms do not match those usually associated with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We will use medical and genetic information from a large number of patients with diabetes to find all the forms of “atypical diabetes,” so doctors can better diagnose and treat these patients. We will also make the Center for Atypical Diabetes Research and Evaluation (CADRE) to keep data and samples from patients with atypical diabetes, so scientists can study these forms of

"The Macrovascular and Microvascular Contributions to Alzheimer's Disease: MESA VASCAD Project Summary Improving vascular health for delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is identified as a critical goal by the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias Conference, the 2015 NIA AD Summit and PAR-15-356 (to which this application is responding). Yet, critical barriers exist to implementing vascular prevention strategies for AD, and elucidating the role of midlife metabolic, macro- and micro- vascular factors in AD is essential to addressing these barriers. Each type of factor may manifest different pathologies in the brain that contribute to dementia sub-types, making a new and sufficiently comprehensive clinical trial a costly and time-consuming undertaking. To address this essential gap, we propose to leverage the rich longitudinal cohort data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study with the addition of detailed cognitive testing and multimodal brain neuroimaging – the MESA VASCAD study. MESA participants at the Wake Forest site (46% African-American, 54% non-Hispanic Caucasian) have already undergone extensive metabolic and vascular phenotyping, repeated retinal imaging and a brief cognitive assessment in 2010-2012. The MESA VASCAD study will add clinical and cognitive assessments (Uniform Data Set and supplemental cognitive tests); neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid PET); and reanalysis of retinal images. We propose to enroll 540 MESA participants in 2 years and repeat assessments 3 years later to more fully characterize targeted, modifiable vascular risk factors for AD. Through our Specific Aims, we will (1) test the hypothesis that baseline macrovascular and microvascular biomarkers in middle-age predict both standard AD neuroimaging outcomes (e.g. hippocampal volume and amyloid deposition assessed with PET) and more novel cerebrovascular biomarkers (e.g. microinfarcts, lacunar infarcts, neurite density and cerebral microbleeds); (2) determine if changes in metabolic and vascular biomarkers over 15 years predict cognitive and AD biomarker trajectory; and (3) using high-dimensional machine learning approaches, determine common, differential and interactive metabolic and vascular risk factor profiles among racial and APOE genotype groups. This proposed ancillary study, approved by the MESA Steering Committee, is led by a New Investigator with an experienced, multi- disciplinary team of collaborators. The MESA study is an ideal cohort for interrogating the questions in this proposal: it has highly detailed longitudinal risk factor data collected over 15+ years in a diverse cohort, which we can leverage and augment with cerebrovascular biomarkers, AD biomarkers, and cognitive reassessments - thereby creating a comprehensive brain phenotype dataset for vascular and AD risk factors. These new data will enable us to examine the timing and impact of vascular biomarkers on dementia biomarkers and cognitive trajectories before a diagnosis of pre-clinical and clinical AD-related disorders, meeting a critical gap in information that will help guide the development of novel therapeutic or prevention strategies for various forms of AD-related dementias. Project Narrative Vascular and metabolic disorders are proposed as potent modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, and may provide key routes for therapeutic and preventive interventions. We propose to leverage the vast resources of the NIH-sponsored Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study to examine the potential contributions of macrovascular and microvascular subclinical disease to AD-related pathology. At the Wake Forest MESA site, we will add neuroimaging, repeated cognitive testing, and reprocessing of existing digital retinal scans with novel measures of retinal microvascular architecture.",The

"A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs To stem the rising incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in our aging population, new methods to repurpose and combine drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) are acutely required. This is a challenge, however, because the complex polygenic basis of AD remains opaque, and rational methods to repurpose drugs are in early years, even for well-defined gene targets. To address these problems, we propose new algorithms to integrate data on a very large scale so as to combine evolutionary information and high-throughput experimental observations with the knowledge conveyed by text in the literature. First, to detect disease-relevant genome variations in AD patients, Aim 1 will combine a novel mathematical calculus of mutational landscapes with machine learning, in so doing suggesting primary candidate genes for drug targeting based on signs of mutational selection in cases or controls. Next, to repurpose and combine drugs targeting these genes, Aim 2 will map a large fraction of all that is known about genes, phenotypes, and drugs into a single high-dimensional network that represents their interactions as described in various databases (structured data) and in the literature (unstructured data). The topology of this network will determine the optimal choice of single drug or combination therapy in an approach that can be personalized. Finally, to validate efficacy experimentally, Aim 3 will test both our candidate genes and drugs with state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo screens.

"Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease using structural systems pharmacology. Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple health threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, efforts in drug discovery and repurposing for the treatment of AD have had limited success. The failure is largely attributed to the adoption of a reductionist model of “one-drug-one-gene- one-disease”. As AD is a multi-facet complex disease, a new treatment approach is urgently needed to simultaneously target multiple pathological processes responsible for the onset and progress of AD, some of which are also common to other diseases that cause dementia. In this application, we will develop an innovative translational bioinformatics approach to addressing challenges in AD drug discovery. Our approach is based on a new paradigm of systems pharmacology, which focuses on defining multiple targets to a single drug or a drug combination, and studying the effect of the drug(s) on perturbing disease-causing networks. Over the last ten years, we have developed a novel structural systems pharmacology (SSP) platform that can predict genome-wide high-resolution protein-chemical interactions and correlate molecular interactions with phenotype responses. The SSP platform synergistically combines novel methods from machine learning, bioinformatics, biophysics, and systems biology. We have successfully applied the SSP platform to drug repurposing, polypharmacology, side effect prediction, precision medicine, and Genome-Wide Association Studies. Building on our successful proof-of-concept studies, and in close collaborations with experimental laboratories, we will develop, and rigorously test a novel SSP approach to AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology. Firstly, we will develop a drug-gene-disease multi-layered network model (MULAN) that links FDA-approved drugs with neurodegenerative diseases through protein-chemical interactions, gene- disease associations, and chemical-disease associations through integrating multiple omics data. Secondly, we will improve and apply our proven successful SSP platform, which can accurately infer novel relations from sparse and noisy MULAN, to identify safe FDA-approved drugs that can be repurposed for AD treatment. Finally, we will experimentally test FDA-approved drugs identified for their binding activity of drug targets and anti-AD potency in cell and animal models. The successful completion of this project will provide an integrated computational modeling framework for AD drug repurposing and polypharmacology as well as identify novel targeted anti-AD therapeutics toward pre-clinical trials. Relevance Statement Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a triple threat – with soaring prevalence, enormous costs and lack of effective treatment. However, AD is a complex disease that has been extremely hard to treat with the conventional approach. New methods that can reuse old drugs to target mulple pathological processes in AD may provide new solutions to effective AD treatment.",Drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease using structural

"Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias that are associated with major adverse effects on daily function and quality of life, and accelerate time to institutionalization. Of all the NPS, depression is the most frequently observed symptom in people with mild cognitive impairment and early AD. As the disease progresses, agitation, delusions and hallucinations become more common, whereas apathy is the most persistent and frequent NPS throughout all the stages of AD. AD-NPS share some clinical features with serious mental illnesses (SMIs), such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, but whether these conditions share similar aethiopathies is unclear. Given that reliable treatments for NPS in the context of AD and other dementias do not exist, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying NPS in AD and other neuropsychiatric illnesses is a critical next step to identify reliable biomarkers that could lead to novel therapeutics.  There are two overarching goals of this proposal. First, we will identify the molecular mechanisms and neuropathological changes that are associated with the presence of NPS in patients with AD. Second, we will examine if the mechanisms of pathology associated with NPS are shared or distinct among AD and SMIs. More specifically, we propose to build multi-scale integrative models using phenomics and genomics data from 1,264 autopsy cases derived from a single brain bank. The bank includes detailed phenomics data such as well characterized NPS, clinical diagnosis (AD and other neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric traits), severity of cognitive decline and neuropathology for each patient sample. From each case, we will apply innovative approaches that reduce the cost and technical biases associated with conventional methods, and capture gene expression signatures and epigenetic regulatory elements at the single-cell level. Novel deep-learning methods will be applied for the multi-scale integration of neuropathologic changes with genetic markers and functional genomic changes (such as changes in gene expression and enhancer sequences) within specific cell types, to predict various NPS in AD and other neuropsychiatric traits; we refer to these integrative models as genotype- marker-phenotype models. We expect that these models will enable us to assign genotypes and molecular markers to specific NPS within AD and other neuropsychiatric traits at the single-cell level, an unprecedented level of resolution. In addition, we will test the translational potential of the genotype-marker-phenotype models to predict AD-NPS using independent large-scale biobank datasets, in which genotypes and electronic health records are available. Successful completion of the proposed studies will have immediate utility by generating potential biomarkers for NPS diagnosis and prognosis and by providing predictive models for patient stratification in clinical trials. In the longer term, our models will help us create a blueprint for therapeutic strategies and interventions to treat NPS in AD. PROJECT SUMMARY Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, that contributes to early institutionalization and causes substantial caregiving and caregiver burden. Despite decades of research, reliable treatments for NPS in the context of AD and other dementias have not been found. The proposed studies will generate and integrate high-dimensional phenomics and genomics data in human brain tissue, that will inform us about the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying NPS in the context of AD and other neuropsychiatric illnesses.",Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer Disease,9905727,R01AG067025,"[""Alzheimer's

"Rhode Island Center for Clinical and Translational Science Abstract. The identification of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prior to the onset of clinical symptoms is critical in order to avert an impending public health crisis. Thus far, clinical trials of secondary prevention interventions have lacked cost- and time-efficiency. This is due to the absence of validated minimally invasive, cost effective, and widely accessible AD risk detection biomarkers. The development of an AD risk detection algorithm comprised of readily available information, including these biomarkers, is essential to identify potential targets for secondary prevention while minimizing cost. Thus far, development of these algorithms have been hampered by lack of collaboration across disciplines, failure to apply advanced and novel statistical techniques, and the complex pathophysiology of the underlying disease. Building on the parent Advance CTR study (U54GM115677; PI: Padbury) with the goal of generating translational research projects across Rhode Island Institutions, the proposed work fosters collaboration between the Brown Center for Biomedical Informatics, the Quantitative Sciences Program at the Alpert Medical School of Brown University, the Butler Hospital Memory & Aging Program (MAP), and the University of Rhode Island. Co-I’s Brick and Sarkar will apply advanced analytic and machine learning techniques to existing internal (Butler MAP Alzheimer’s Prevention Registry) and external (GAAIN) datasets to develop, test, and validate an AD risk detection algorithm. They will work with Co-I’s (Alber, Lee) on the MAP staff to collect prospective biomarker data (amyloid PET, retinal imaging, blood based- biomarkers) to improve and refine this algorithm, providing the springboard for a dynamic dataset based at Brown that can be used to develop and validate novel AD risk biomarkers in the state of Rhode Island. Project Narrative. Over five million adults in the United States are affected by Alzheimer’s disease and this number is rising. The development of a widely accessible, minimally invasive, cost-effective method for early detection is a global public health imperative. The overarching goal of this study is to develop a sustainable database of AD risk markers to be used for collaborative research and to develop a risk algorithm that will identify individuals at risk for AD at the earliest pathologic stage, prior to the onset of clinical symptoms.",Rhode Island Center for Clinical and Translational Science,9881461,U54GM115677,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult

"Development of Serious Games and Physical Activities Instructed by a Social Robot for Improving the Well-being of Elderly Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia The objective of the proposed direct Phase-II SBIR project is to develop and study and the effectiveness of Serious Games and physical Activities played/performed by elderly people with Alzheimer’s disease and AD- related Dementias in interaction with Ryan, our successfully piloted Socially Assistive Robot (SAR). Ryan is an intelligent conversational life-like social robot, designed to improve the well-being and quality of life of older adults with AD/ADRD. Ryan uses state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence technology for automated facial expression recognition, natural language processing, and tracking of human body that are used in personalization and adaptation of the games and physical activities. According to the Alzheimer’s Association an estimated 5.7 million Americans have AD and is projected to rise to 13.8 million, as the population ages. Common symptoms of AD/ADRD include cognitive decline, short-term memory loss, changes in mood, depression, communication difficulties, lost interest in hobbies or activities, and repetitive behavior. Americans suffering from AD/ADRD are believed to cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Traditional methods for disease management have shown limited success treating AD/ADRD or mitigating its symptoms. Health care personnel and caregivers who are physically and emotionally taxed are seeking new ways to provide care for elderly individuals and particularly those suffering from AD/ADRD. Innovative technology such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, have begun to alleviate the growing need for novel solutions to the healthcare. Among such technologies, socially assistive robots such as Ryan have received a great amount of attention in recent years. While SAR research prototypes exist that can interact with users playing physical cognitive games equipped with artificial intelligence technology and personalization, to our knowledge, no such cooperative SAR (prototype or commercial) for electronic gameplay with individuals suffering from dementia exists today. Our game designs will target “Cognition”, “Memory”, “Spatial Relation”, “Social Relationship”, and “Motor Skills” abilities of players. We will conduct a pilot study to measure Ryan’s effectiveness in mental and socio- emotional stimulation of users with mild dementia. This innovative technology stands to produce significant financial savings and improve the quality of life of individuals living with AD/ADRD, their families, and caregivers. The goal of the project is to develop serious games and physical activities co-played by a socially assistive robot companionbot (Ryan) for improving the quality of life of persons with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Americans suffering from AD cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Successful development of Ryan will improve patient well-being, make caregivers more efficient and effective, and provide significant financial benefits to the healthcare industry, and assist families and caregivers who are looking for ways to better assist older adults with AD.",Development of Serious Games and Physical Activities Instructed by a Social Robot for Improving the Well-being of

"Genetic Predictors, Transcriptomic Biomarkers, & Neurobiological Signatures of Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary Over the last decade, scientists have accelerated their efforts to understand Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This has led to unprecedented knowledge of the genetic and biological bases of AD risk, and vast stores of valuable data for further mining. Understanding the genetic and biological risk states for AD is, in itself, extraordinarily valuable for guiding mechanistic studies, developing better diagnostics, and formulating therapeutics. But an understanding of risk states also has the benefit of allowing research on resilience to AD. Research on the genetic and biological bases of resilience necessarily lags behind the discovery of risk factors. Now, as the risk architecture of AD is coming into view, it is feasible to study resilience to AD in individuals who are cognitively normal despite being at elevated risk for the disease. The approach we have devised for identifying resilience factors is straightforward yet, to our knowledge, unprecedented. We identify unaffected individuals at the highest levels of multivariate risk, match them to affected individuals at equivalent levels of risk, and contrast these two subgroups to find residual variation associated with the absence of disease. In this project, we will capitalize on the wealth of existing high-throughput AD risk-factor results and data, and our involvement in many of the world’s largest AD consortia, to efficiently map resilience to AD at three levels (genetics, transcriptomics, and neuroimaging), and to integrate across these levels. In Aim 1, we will identify genetic variation associated with resilience to AD in the presence of elevated genetic risk conferred by APOE ε4 alleles, an elevated AD polygenic risk score, or an elevated AD polygenic hazard score. In Aim 2, we will mega-analyze all available transcriptomic data from studies of postmortem hippocampal tissue and of peripheral blood in AD to identify transcriptomic risk scores and machine-learning algorithms that maximally distinguish AD from cognitively normal control subjects, and scores and algorithms that then identify residual transcriptomic variation that offsets the transcriptomic risk in resilient controls. In Aim 3, we will identify an MRI-based structural brain signature that is associated with resilience to AD in the presence of an AD- associated cortical risk signature. Lastly, in our exploratory Aim 4, we will integrate genetic, transcriptomic, brain structural, and clinical data to identify biological relationships across Aims, and novel phenotypes of resilience. Collectively, these Aims will identify multivariate, genetic, transcriptomic, and brain-structural profiles of resilience to AD, as well as molecular, neurobiological, and clinical phenotypes stemming from AD- resilience genotypes. Project Narrative Not all people at high risk for Alzheimer's disease develop the disorder. This project aims to identify genes, molecules, and brain structures that protect some people from their otherwise-elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease. Finding the biological basis for resilience to Alzheimer's disease may shed light on better options for diagnosing, treating, and even preventing the illness, in ways that can't be found by only studying people who already have the disease.","Genetic Predictors, Transcriptomic Biomarkers, & Neurobiological Signatures of Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease",9839179,R01AG064955,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' apolipoprotein E4 ', ' apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 ', ' apoE4 ', ' apoE-4 ', ' apoE epsilon 4 ', ' apo epsilon4 ', ' apo E4 ', ' apo E-4 ', ' APOEε4 ', ' APOE\xa0e4 ', ' APOE-ε4 ', ' apolipoprotein E-4 ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' brain tissue ', ' interest ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Prevention ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Sampling ', ' Brain region ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Molecular ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' resilience ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' transcriptomics ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' stem ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' phenome ', ' genetic predictors ', ' Genetic study ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' secondary analysis ', ' high dimensionality ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIA,UPSTATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,790352,0.38398734232897574
"US-South American Initiative for Genetic-Neural-Behavioral Interactions in Human Neurodegenerative Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although dementia has a global impact, efforts to address ensuing challenges have come mostly from high- income countries (HICs). Whereas the prevalence and incidence of dementia appear to be stable or declining in such countries, an alarmingly opposite tendency typifies South American countries (SAC). This scenario proves even more challenging due to region-specific traits. First, the particular genetic and environmental backgrounds of SAC limit the generalizability of key findings from HICs. Moreover, the greater genetic diversity and impact of socioeconomic status (SES) of SAC remain markedly understudied. Of note, this is true of the four largest SAC (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Peru), representing over 75% of the region’s population. In addition, SAC face a dearth of innovative, harmonized, and cross-regional studies on two of their most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It is thus critical for SAC to join ongoing international efforts and develop a gold-standard approach for detecting disease-specific alterations in a context of methodological, genetic, and socioeconomic heterogeneity. Against this background, our long-term goal is to identify the unique genetic and SES factors that drive AD and FTD presentation in SAC relative to the US. To this end, we will establish a cohort to test large samples from the four abovementioned SAC, as well as the US (totaling > 3000 participants, including 1500 controls, 750 AD patients, and 750 FTD patients). We will combine standardized clinical assessments with innovative analytical techniques including multimodal machine learning to account for heterogeneity in these diverse populations. By combining standardized genetic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (SES-cognitive) measures, we will test the underlying hypothesis that there are unique risk factors for AD and FTD in SAC which do not prove significant in US populations. More particularly, we will aim to (a) establish genetic risk to AD and FTD in diverse SAC cohorts; (b) test whether patients from SAC and the US can be discriminated after accounting for how SES affects cognitive and brain imaging signatures; and (c) determine genetic, cognitive, cerebral, and socioeconomic factors that discriminate among SAC vs. US patients. Positive impacts of this work include a better understanding of the genetic and socioeconomic factors driving neurocognitive manifestations of dementia, and the identification of novel genetic targets for risk reduction and disease prevention in SAC. Our large multimodal, cross-sectional study will enable clinical assessment of understudied patient groups, extend and harmonize existing data sets, and prompt the development of novel measures and multimodal machine learning protocols. More generally, by establishing a collaborative framework which capitalizes on unique regional populations, our proposal can consolidate a SAC-based platform for future translational research and assessment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although the prevalence and incidence of dementia appears to be stable or declining in high-income countries, South American countries (SAC) face the opposite scenario, with increased dementia prevalence, probably triggered by a combination of genetic and socioeconomic status (SES) factors. This proposal aims to create the first SAC-based multicenter initiative to study dementia, by combining genomic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (cognitive, clinical, socioeconomic) data. This project constitutes an unprecedented opportunity to foster regional synergy and multilevel research towards the harmonization of global strategies to fight dementia in SAC.",US-South American

"The Neuropathologic Landscape of Alzheimer's Disease in Hispanic Decedents Abstract: Hispanics are the fastest growing population in the US and epidemiological data suggests they are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and have a higher occurrence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) when compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). AD is defined neuropathologically by the deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid plaques. In addition to these hallmarks, many AD patients have mixed neuropathologies, including Lewy bodies (LBs) and pathological indices of CVD. Studies, involving mainly NHWs, have shown associations of these neuropathologies with clinical, genetic, and demographic variables providing insights into disease mechanisms and prevention strategies. However, there is a relative dearth of neuropathology studies on Hispanics. It is imperative to have neuropathology studies with individuals having diverse characteristics as this maximizes variability allowing for better identification of disease risk factors for more precision in development of preventative measures. This study will examine the neuropathologic landscape (the presence, location, and density of NFTs, plaques, CVD and LBs) of Hispanics compared to NHWs and determine if this landscape is altered by clinical, genetic, and demographic variables. To achieve efficiencies in time and further measurement precision we will enhance and adapt innovative machine learning algorithms to narrow in on pathology location and provide more quantitative analyses. Based on previous findings our central hypothesis is that Hispanics will have different neuropathologic landscapes when compared to NHWs and these differences are influenced by underlying risk factors, especially cardiovascular risk factors. Our specific aims are to: 1) profile the presence, location, and semi-quantitative densities of NFTs, plaques, LBs, and pathological indices of CVD in the setting of AD in Hispanics compared to NHWs, 2) profile and determine if pathologic measures from Aim 1 are altered by clinical, genetic, and demographic variables (APOE status, Hispanic origin, age at death, clinical history of cerebrovascular events (i.e. stroke), hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, sex, and/or education) and 3) strengthen and adapt a deep learning pipeline for quantifying AD pathologies. We will capitalize on existing well-characterized resources within three Alzheimer’s disease centers at University of California- Davis, the University of California- San Diego, and Columbia that contain a diverse autopsy confirmed AD Hispanic and NHW cohort. Also, we will use machine learning resources at the University of California San Francisco. This proposal will be the first largescale initiative to delineate the neuropathology in over 100 Hispanics of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Dominican origins compare to over 200 NHWs and determine the impact of comorbid risk factors. Profiling neuropathologic landscapes and understanding underlying factors has potential to shed light on mechanistic differences in disease development leading to better diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies. Results will directly advance understanding of brain health (pathology) in an important and growing part of the elderly population that to date there is miniscule neuropathology information. Project Narrative: Hispanics are the fastest growing population in the US and epidemiological data suggests they are at a higher risk of dementia. This proposal will be the first largescale initiative to delineate the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease in Hispanics compare to non-Hispanic Whites and determine the impact of comorbid risk factors.

"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9746755,R01GM126550,"['Affect ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' anticancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Biology ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Communication ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' Label ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' drug sensitivity ', ' Research Activity ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' brain cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' user friendly software ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' gene expression assay ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Skeleton ', ' Regulation ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' disorder subtype ', ' disease subtype ', ' disease subgroups ', ' technique development ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' life-style factor ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' patient population ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,400001,0.10631509493526464
"Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate is an epileptologist and neuroscientist at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Medical School, whose long-term career goal is to become an independent- ly funded translational investigator with expertise at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases. Patients with neurodegenerative diseases are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and patients with epilepsy often suffer from cognitive co-morbidities. The ability to translate the clinical experience, research tools, and intellectual framework from the field of epilepsy to that of the neurodegenerative diseases, and vice versa, could be a powerful approach to studying both processes. During the proposed training period, the candidate will combine her prior training in epilepsy, EEG signal processing, and machine learning, with newly acquired skills in neuroimaging (functional MRI), biostatistics, and additional clinical exposure to patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Under the mentorship of Dr. Sydney Cash, an expert in epilepsy and neurophysiologic signal processing, and the co-mentorship of Dr. Reisa Sperling, an expert in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and neuroimaging approaches, the candidate proposes to: 1) Delineate the spectrum of epileptiform activity in early stages of AD and develop computa- tional tools to identify this activity; 2) Establish the pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie epileptiform activity in AD; and 3) Determine how epileptiform abnormalities are associated with cognitive trajectories in patients with early stage AD. Visual and computational analysis of 24- hour scalp EEGs will be integrated with resting-state and task-based fMRI measurements, amy- loid PET imaging, and longitudinal cognitive testing from subjects with AD, to develop a com- prehensive understanding of the role of epileptiform abnormalities in early stages of AD. In addi- tion to the research proposed, the candidate’s career development plan entails rigorous coursework and seminars, practical hands-on experience, and close guidance from a board of academic advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow the candidate to establish a clinical and research niche at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases, and to develop a comprehensive toolbox with which to probe human brain function from the standpoint of neurophysiology, structure, connectivity, and tar- geted pathology. Collectively, these will form the foundation for a successful career as an inde- pendent investigator pursuing important clinical and translational research projects to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, or both. Project Narrative People with Alzheimer’s disease are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and people with epilepsy commonly suffer from impairments in memory and cognition. Our goals are to better understand the interplay between epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease, and to determine whether epileptiform activity may be a treatable contributor to cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s disease. This has important public health implications, as according to the Alzheimer’s Association, a treatment that slows the rate of progression of Alzheimer’s disease by five-fold would reduce the number of people with severe Alzheimer’s disease from 6.5 million to 1.2 million and reduce Medicare costs by 50% by the year 2050.",Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's

"Longitudinal Analysis of the Dynamic Network Disruptions in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract A plethora of neuroscience studies has found that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) can be understood as a dysfunction syndrome where the structural and functional connectivity of the large-scale network are progressively disrupted by molecular pathomechanism that is not fully understood. The disruptions to the network exhibit dynamic patterns at different stages of AD, which holds valuable clues to understand AD progression. Current network computational tools are designed for cross-sectional data only, which is insufficient to maintain temporal consistency in investigating longitudinal network changes. To address this problem, we will develop the first extensive computational tool for longitudinal network analysis. Specifically, we will propose a learning-based approach to precisely quantify the evolution of brain network from noisy imaging data (Aim 1). Sparse representation and tensor analysis technique will be integrated to seek for the consistent longitudinal brain networks. We will apply our longitudinal network analysis tool to the series diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data from ADNI database to investigate how Alzheimer’s disease attacks human brain network by inspecting the dynamic interactions between the hub and non-hub nodes in AD progression (Aim 2). The outcome of this project will be the first longitudinal brain network analysis tool in computational neuroscience and neuroimaging fields. We will release the software (both binary program and source code), to facilitate the network studies in other neuro diseases that show brain network dysfunction. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a set of efficient computational tools specifically for longitudinal brain network analysis. In order to accurately measure the connectivity strength, we propose a learning-based approach to find the intrinsic brain network from the noisy imaging data. Sparse representation and tensor analysis technique have been integrated into brain network optimization for preserving the longitudinal consistency. It is worth noting that our data-driven approach is free of the ad-hoc thresholding technique which may undermine the repeatability of discovery. To the best of our knowledge, our learning-based approach is the first extensive computational tool for longitudinal network analysis in neuroscience and neuroimaging field. We will apply our longitudinal network analysis tools to the series diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data from ADNI database to investigate how Alzheimer’s disease attacks human brain network by inspecting the dynamic interactions between hub and non-hub nodes in AD progression.

"Integrative Motor Activity Biomarker for the Risk of Alzheimer's Risk Project Summary/Abstract Developing effective interventions for prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires early detection of the disease. With recent advances in wearable device and physiological data analytical tools, it is feasible to assess many physiological functions unobtrusively by monitoring spontaneous motor activity. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated, non-invasive biomarker for the risk of Alzheimer's dementia using motor activity recordings. Among many physiological functions derived from motor activity, reduced physical activity levels, sleep disturbances, circadian dysfunction, and perturbation in fractal physiological regulation appear to precede the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and signify an elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia. However, it is unknown whether these dysfunctions predict Alzheimer's risk independently or they are interconnected to amplify/diminish each other's adverse effect. For a better prediction of Alzheimer's dementia using motor activity, PI and his team propose to leverage the above physiological risk factors using a novel artificial intelligence technique. To achieve this, PI and his team will utilize the existing longitudinal database of the Memory and Aging Project at Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, in which over 1,400 old participants have been enrolled since 2005 and have agreed to (i) undergo annual motor activity monitor and structured clinical examinations and (ii) donate brain, the entire spinal cord, and selected nerve and muscles at the time of death. The ambulatory motor activity recordings collected annually will be used to assess a series of constructs including (i) physical activity (level of physical activity, intensity of physical activity, and average daily inactivity duration), (ii) sleep characteristics (total sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and sleep fragmentation), (iii) circadian rhythmicitiy (normalized 24-h amplitude, acrophase of daily activity rhythm, interdaily stability, and intradaily variability), and (iv) fractal motor regulation (temporal correlations in motor activity fluctuations at small and large time scales). Using these physiological measures together with clinical diagnosis, cognition, genetics, and post-mortem histopathology, three aims will be addressed: 1) determine whether a deep learning based neural network model can construct an integrated biomarker from the above physiological measures for better prediction of the risk of Alzheimer's dementia and the risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's dementia in a short time frame (i.e., 2 years); 2) determine whether the integrated biomarker modifies or interacts with the genetic effect on AD; and 3) determine how specifically the integrated biomarker reflects AD pathology at autopsy. Achieving the aims will result in the first integrated biomarker of motor activity that leverages multimodal, noninvasive measurements for a better prediction of Alzheimer's dementia. The results to be obtained may also lead to a better understanding of the complex biology and physiology of AD, which will potentially guide the seeking of disease modifying therapies or interventions. NARRATIVE Many non-cognitive physiological changes including reduced physical activity, sleep and circadian disturbances, and degraded fractal regulation predict the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and they can be assessed unobtrusively from daily spontaneous motor activity. Adopting a novel artificial intelligence approach, this project is proposed to develop an integrated biomarker for AD risk in older adults by combining these physiological functions, and to examine the relationships of this biomarker with genetics and AD pathology. This project will potentially provide a non-invasive tool for predicting AD risk and lead unique insights into the complex pathology of AD, which is important for developing new therapeutic strategies to treat AD or slow down AD progression.",Integrative Motor Activity Biomarker for the Risk of Alzheimer's Risk,9804299,RF1AG064312,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', '

"Robust Inference from Observational Data with Distributed Representations of Conceptual Relations Abstract This proposal concerns the development and evaluation of computational methods through which linguistic manifestations of cognitive changes in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) dementia can be identified in transcribed speech. Such methods are of value even prior to the availability of disease modifying treatments, as through earlier detection they provide the means to reduce the emotional and financial burden on patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system. Lack of a clear diagnosis in the face of cognitive manifestations of dementia can produce uncertainty, and negatively impact planning of future care. Misattributed AD symptoms can lead to social isolation. In addition, it is estimated that early and accurate diagnosis can help save an estimated $7.9 trillion in medical and care costs. With ~30-40% of healthy adults subjectively reporting forgetfulness on a regular basis, there is an urgent need to develop sensitive and specific, easy-to-use, safe, and cost-effective tools for monitoring AD-specific cognitive markers in individuals concerned about their cognitive function. Language reflects cognitive status, but manual analysis of language data is prohibitively time-consuming. In the proposed research we will develop and evaluate computational methods to identify linguistic biomarkers of AD, leveraging perplexity estimates derived from neural language models trained on transcripts of the speech of healthy controls only. This approach deviates from the supervised learning paradigm that characterizes most computational linguistics approaches to identifying AD, obviating the danger of overfitting to the characteristics of participants with dementia represented in the small datasets available for training. Nonetheless, our preliminary research has demonstrated that classification performance on the basis of such perplexity estimates rivals that documented with supervised machine learning models trained on hundreds of manually engineered features. The proposed research will result in a validated set of methods for detection of AD using transcribed speech, methods with the potential for broad dissemination on account of recent advances in automated speech recognition. Project Narrative The need to monitor unintended effects of medications has been highlighted by several high-profile events in which fatal side effects of approved drugs were detected after their release to market. In the proposed research, we will develop and evaluate methods to identify biologically plausible adverse drug events using both observational data and knowledge extracted from the biomedical literature. If successful, these methods will provide the means for earlier detection of harmful drug effects, limiting consequent morbidity and mortality.",Robust Inference from Observational Data with Distributed Representations of Conceptual Relations,9881862,R01LM011563,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Awareness ', ' Boston ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Confusion ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Engineering ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Literature ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Personality ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Research ', ' Social isolation ', ' Speech ', ' Standardization ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Stealing ', ' Theft ', ' Time ', ' visually impaired ', ' vision impairment ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Low Vision ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Event ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Neurobehavioral Manifestations ', ' neurobehavioral symptom ', ' Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms ', ' Cognitive Symptoms ', ' Cognitive Manifestations ', ' interest ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Memory Loss ', ' memory decline ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost effective ', ' Consumption ', ' neural model ', ' Alzheimer disease detection ', ' AD detection ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' Computational Linguistics ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' care costs ', ' data warehouse ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Banks ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' automated speech recognition ', ' automatic speech recognition ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' side effect ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial stress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial distress ', ' financial burden ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,400387,0.047605501772794066
"The Longitudinal Course O\F Imaging Biomarkers in People At RISK of AD The goal of this ongoing R01 is to chart the progression of pathobiologic markers of presymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and their effect on neural function and cognition in a late-middle-aged cohort enriched with risk for AD. There is an appreciable gap in knowledge about the temporal disease course in this age range that this ongoing project has been directly addressing with serial multimodal imaging including amyloid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection, and serial cognitive measurement. In the next funding cycle we will add a new positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technique sensitive to fibrillar tau [F-18]THK5351 indexing neurofibrillary pathology. In the prior funding period we recruited 179 individuals from a registry of 1,545 people at risk for AD known as WRAP (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention). We found that [C-11]PIB amyloid burden is detectable in 20% of people with parental history of AD at a mean age of 60. Baseline amyloid is more extensive in the presence of higher CSF total tau levels, and 2-year increases in PiB amyloid are significantly predicted by higher baseline CSF tau. The hypothesis for this renewal is that tau- related neurofibrillar pathology begins early (in accord with the neuropathology literature) in people at AD risk and its strategic spatial burden explains changes in amyloid, neural function and cognitive decline. Aim 1: To test the premise that amyloid burden is necessary but not sufficient to evoke preclinical cognitive change. We will examine effects of longitudinal amyloid and tau change on episodic memory trajectories over time in 235 at risk individuals including all subjects we previously enrolled and follow them over 2 years with advanced multimodal imaging and CSF. Aim 2: To assess the effects of tau and amyloid imaging on MRI and CSF indicators of neural injury and function. Aim 3: To develop a multimodal disease marker to maximize efficiency of clinical trials in preclinical AD. Following our work in creating tools for efficient clinical trials in MCI, we will extend these concepts to the pre-MCI phase of disease utilizing deep learning architectures with tau, amyloid and structural imaging inputs. We will also examine change over time in tau, amyloid and cognition as outcomes. As any of these features considered singularly may be affected by age, and as amyloid and tau may be `necessary but not sufficient' by themselves, a derived multimodal marker may have eventual clinical utility in enriching prevention trials with those most likely to progress, and increasing power to detect change attributable to preclinical interventions. Significance: Relative tau and amyloid imaging profiles have not been empirically established in the presymptomatic time frame and this information is urgently needed to identify incipient disease. No comparable studies exist regarding the evolution of tau and amyloid signal in the critical late-middle-age time frame of preclinical AD. This ongoing project represents a unique opportunity to examine the earliest determinants of AD progression, when treatments may be most meaningful. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/ NARRATIVE Identifying the earliest neuropathological features of AD including tau and amyloid pathology will improve early detection and inform clinical trials in the presymptomatic time frame. This project will examine these features with advanced imaging methods in a cohort at risk for AD who are largely asymptomatic. An outgrowth of the project will be information about the rate of change in AD pathology which can help us plan clinical trials in this population using derived outcomes about the brain itself, thereby reducing the number of subjects needed in a trial and increasing sensitivity to detecting change.",The Longitudinal Course O\F Imaging Biomarkers in People At RISK of AD,9851062,R01AG021155,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' brain blood flow ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Pathology ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' amyloid-b protein ', ' amyloid beta ', ' abeta ', ' a beta peptide ', ' Aβ ', ' Amyloid β-Protein ', ' Amyloid β-Peptide ', ' Amyloid β ', ' Amyloid Protein A4 ', ' Amyloid Beta-Peptide ', "" Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein "", "" Alzheimer's amyloid "", "" Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein "", ' Alzheimer beta-Protein ', ' Amyloid beta-Protein ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' tangle ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' τ Proteins ', ' tau factor ', ' tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' tau Proteins ', ' nerve injury ', ' neural injury ', ' entorhinal cortex ', ' Entorhinal Area ', ' Hippocampal Formation ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Atrophic ', ' Atrophy ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Semantic memory ', ' interest ', ' Episodic memory ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Neurophysiology -

"A Proinflammatory Endophenotype to Predict NSAID Treatment Response Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials PROJECT SUMMARY It is our hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are heterogeneous conditions and, therefore, a paradigm shift is required to identify specific subpopulations for targeted interventions. This approach has generated significant success in other complex diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. A key opportunity in this context is the identification of those most likely to benefit from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs and other anti-inflammatory compounds. The relation between inflammation and the development of AD, MCI, and cognitive decline has received a great deal of attention with basic science and observational human studies demonstrating a protective effect against cognitive loss. Likewise, in our work, inflammation has been a key mechanism in the biological profile that is indicative of disease presence. Based on a wealth of literature (epidemiological, cross-sectional, pathobiological and animal model), multiple clinical trials have been conducted to determine the utility of NSAID compounds in treating or preventing AD (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study [ADCS] AD and MCI anti-inflammatory trials; Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial [ADAPT]); however, each of these studies failed to demonstrate therapeutic benefit, in fact some patients may have exhibited worsening cognitive performance with treatment. Our preliminary data suggests that particular subsets of patients in these trials did benefit from treatment and that our blood-based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify both positive and adverse responders within these trials. Here we propose to leverage three previously conducted clinical trials to test our hypothesis that our blood- based proinflammatory endophenotype can identify the subsets of patients who benefited from these previously conducted clinical trials. By conducting proteomic assays from existing biorepositories from the ADCS and ADAPT, we will address the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate the utility of the proinflammatory endophenotype as a means for patient selection into NSAID therapy for treating and preventing AD; Specific Aim 2. To determine if change in proinflammatory endophenotype scores over time is a biomarker of therapeutic response. By leveraging a highly innovative method and substantial existing resources, the current project addresses a significant need in the search for novel approaches AD therapeutics. The significance of the current project is the identification of a specific subset of patients who will experience clinically significant cognitive benefit from administration of NSAID medication. If successful, the current project will set the stage for a novel clinical trial that enrolls patients specifically based on baseline proinflammatory endophenotype scores for administration of NSAID therapy. In the long-term, this line of research is designed to build a person-centered (i.e. personalized) approach to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's diseases are a growing public health crisis impacting millions of elders world-wide with a health care cost greater than cancer and equivalent to cardiovascular disease. Current treatments only slow progression of the disease and new strategies are urgently needed. The relevance of the current project is the validation of a person-centered approach to treating Alzheimer's disease by identifying specific subgroups that are most likely to respond to targeted therapies. The outcomes of this project will fundamentally change the approach to the search for novel therapies for AD from the “one-size-fits-all” approach to the search for specific subgroups that can be treated with targeted medications.",A Proinflammatory Endophenotype to Predict NSAID Treatment Response Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials,9686501,R01AG051848,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', '

"CSF, MRI, and PET biomarkers of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorder. Inflammatory changes in the brain are thought to represent key processes in the onset and progression of AD, but it remains unclear whether neuroinflammation confers neuroprotection, accelerated degeneration, or possibly both. Such an understanding in living humans is critical if we are to begin clinical trials using the array of FDA-approved immunomodulatory drugs in the future. We propose that complement- mediated neuroinflammation is protective in the early AD stages, while suppression of complement activities is accompanied by the development of greater cognitive deficits and faster cognitive decline. Our preliminary data from multiple cohorts support this hypothesis by showing 1) reduced levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) complement-related markers occur in the dementia stage but not mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of AD; 2) reduced CSF complement-related markers and elevated CSF interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels are associated with faster decline in AD; and 3) CSF inflammatory protein alterations reveal networks of cellular and protein regulations. In the In the current application, we will build on the association between complement related proteins and rates of cognitive decline in AD to identify associated changes in soluble CSF cytokines and chemokines, differential inflammatory cell type regulation, and imaging correlates of neuroinflammation. This application takes advantage of our group’s strengths in performing CSF cytokine measurements, CSF immunophenotyping, molecular imaging of neuroinflammation through positron emission tomography (PET) and iron-enhanced MRI, and network analysis through a novel biochemical-bioinformatics pipeline. We will directly identify individual and networks of soluble CSF cytokines that accompany the transition from the MCI to the dementia stage of AD, correlate the complement and other altered pathways with microglial activation through two modern PET tracers (11C-PBR28 and 18F-FEPPA), and measure changes in individual T helper cell (type 1, 2, 17) and non-T cell populations. This application represents the first attempt to correlate, at the individual level and at the group level, CSF and imaging measures of neuroinflammation. If successful, this application will advance the understanding of neuroinflammation in AD through parallel approaches, form the basis of a new biomarker panel (and algorithm) to diagnose AD through a combination of degenerative and inflammatory markers, and accelerate the target identification of future therapeutics aimed at modulating the immune system in AD. Brain inflammation is a key event in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease, but it is not clear whether it is harmful, protective, or both. The current proposal aims to confirm our finding that a switch from the protective to harmful type of inflammation predicts more severe symptoms and faster progression in Alzheimer’s disease, and we can identify people with the protective and harmful inflammation by studying the cerebrospinal fluid (circulating proteins and cells) and brain imaging (PET and MRI scans).","CSF, MRI, and PET

"Novel Approaches to Identifying and Engaging Disadvantaged Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in Clinical Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite well-documented disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prevalence, incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and mortality, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial/ethnic minorities) are disproportionately under-represented in clinical AD research. Current recruitment methods for AD research predominantly identify patients from outpatient clinics and community settings, or with pre-existing diagnoses. Reliance on these recruitment approaches may create barriers to participation for disadvantaged individuals as they are more likely to lack information about AD services, be undiagnosed and have limited access to outpatient care. Yet, greater enrollment of disadvantaged individuals into AD studies is critically needed to achieve national goals for AD research. Targeted AD screening and tailored recruitment within acute care settings has strong potential to address these gaps, as disadvantaged individuals often rely on these settings to meet their health needs. This K76 proposal is designed to provide Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi, PhD, a geriatric trained nurse and expert in AD symptom management with the training required for success as an independent clinician-scientist focused on improving AD identification to promote greater participation in research and access to effective care and therapies, specifically targeting high-risk disadvantaged populations. The overarching objective of the proposed research is to design screening and recruitment approaches for identifying and engaging disadvantaged AD patients/caregivers and their biological children in research from acute care settings. The proposal consists of validation of an electronic health record (EHR) Phenotype Model for AD using EHR clinical data identified in preliminary studies (Aim 1), and specification of this Model for performance among disadvantaged individuals (Aim 1a). To address recruitment from acute care environments, mixed methods strategies will inform the design of tailored recruitment approaches appropriate to acute care (Aim 2) which will be piloted with 30 AD patients/caregivers to determine their feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact on willingness to enroll in a Trial Registry (Aim 2a). As a junior faculty member at an institution with extensive support for early stage investigators and significant infrastructure in AD disparities and EHR Phenotyping, Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi is in an ideal environment to complete the proposed research and pursue advanced training relevant to her career goals. Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi’s career development plan integrates didactic and practical training, individual mentoring and mentored research activities in the areas of 1) clinical trial design, 2) advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, 3) acute care research, 4) AD health disparities, 5) recruitment and retention of vulnerable populations and 6) leadership. This proposed award addresses fundamental gaps and barriers to improve inclusion of disadvantaged individuals in AD research while affording training and mentored research critical for Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi to lead an independent research program in clinical AD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Under-representation of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial and ethnic minorities) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is a major barrier to achieving national AD research goals and exacerbates widespread health disparities in AD. The proposed research addresses fundamental barriers to research participation among disadvantaged individuals with AD through the development of novel 1) screening and 2) recruitment approaches within acute care settings, where many disadvantaged individuals routinely seek health care. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to improve access and engagement in AD research among disadvantaged groups.",Novel Approaches to Identifying and Engaging Disadvantaged Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in Clinical Research,9770763,K76AG060005,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' mortality ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Terminology ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Patient Care Episodes ', ' care episode ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' Development Plans ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Techniques ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Exclusion ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) ', ' ICD-10 ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Improve Access ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Validation ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' disease phenotype ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Alzheimer disease detection ', ' AD detection ', ' Alzheimer disease screening ', ' Alzheimer screening ', "" Alzheimer's disease model "", ' alzheimer model ', ' AD model ', ' high risk ', ' community setting ', ' group intervention ', ' screening ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' racial minority ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' Infrastructure ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K76,2019,236075,0.35486632524462014
"Molecular Networks Underlying Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Among APOE E4 Carriers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The e4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene has been identified as one of the strongest genetic determinants of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In general, the e4 allele is associated with reductions in neural protection and repair, increasing a carrier’s vulnerability to damage accumulated over his/her lifetime. Nevertheless, while the penetrance of ApoE e4 is relatively high, a significant proportion of e4 carriers will never develop AD. The overall goal of this project is to model interactions across multiple omics networks to identify the biological pathways involved in sporadic AD susceptibility versus resilience among high-risk individuals. The multifactorial nature of AD suggests that it may manifest as a result of complex interactions across the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome. Identifying the central networks involved in AD pathogenesis will require integrative Systems Biology approaches. The proposed research offers a new and innovative way to integrate networks—a dominant feature in biology—across multiple tissues and omics platforms, in order to identify innate and dynamic precursors of resilience to AD, among a high-risk population (e4+). Towards this goal, we will: (1) employ newly developed GWAS-based network analysis, to identify SNP networks that alter the association between ApoE e4 and cognitive decline/dementia; (2) generate DNA methylation and RNA-seq data from brain samples that we will analyze using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (3) generate proteomic data from brain and CSF samples that we will analyze using WGCNA to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (4) use advanced integromic network analysis to identify multi-omics and multi-tissue pathways and biological systems involved in AD resilience. The integration of multiple 'omics' data using systems biology will be crucial for unraveling the connections and interactions between various functional levels involved in complex diseases, such as AD. Overall, our proposed research will improve understanding of the complex biology underlying AD susceptibility. These studies have the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets that could inform the development of future pharmacologic interventions aimed at preventing or slowing AD pathogenesis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individuals with the ApoE e4 genotype have a substantially increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The goal of this project is identify underlying biological interactions and networks that explain why some e4 carriers do not develop Alzheimer's disease, despite being high-risk. This research has

"Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation Summary Transcription activation, a key step in gene control, is the readout of many signaling pathways controlling cell growth, development and stress response and defects in activation cause many human diseases and syndromes. Activation typically results from factors containing activation domains (ADs) binding to coactivator complexes containing activator binding domains (ABDs). Understanding the nature of ADs, the specificity of AD-coactivator interactions, and mechanisms of coactivator cooperativity are necessary for understanding the molecular basis of gene regulation. The long-term goal of this project is to determine mechanisms used by gene-specific activators and coactivators to regulate RNA polymerase (Pol) II transcription. The objectives of this proposal are to determine: i) mechanisms of Mediator recruitment and its interaction with ADs, ii) mechanisms of cooperativity between Mediator and the coactivator SAGA, and iii) what constitutes a functional AD and determines the AD specificity for different coactivators and promoter types. This work will utilize an interdisciplinary combination of biochemical, structural, molecular, and computational approaches to examine transcriptional activation in S. cerevisiae. To understand these mechanisms, we will build upon several breakthrough concepts and methods developed in the past grant period. We will use a combination of genomics and biochemistry to identify a new mechanism of Mediator recruitment that is likely used at many genes. We will use orthogonal approaches to determine how the coactivator SAGA stimulates genome-wide transcription, either by direct interaction with the Pol II preinitiation complex (PIC) and/or by direct interaction with Mediator. We will determine the structural basis for AD-Mediator Tail domain interaction using a combination of biochemical and structural analysis. Finally, we will use a combination of biochemistry, genomics, and computational analysis to predict AD function and specificity and identify new mechanisms of AD-coactivator interaction. The expected outcome of these studies will be a molecular understanding of transcription activator specificity and function, mechanisms used by the coactivators Mediator and SAGA to promote transcription, and an understanding of how these factors function at different classes of genes –a leap forward in understanding widely conserved mechanisms of eukaryotic gene regulation. Project Narrative Regulation of transcription by activation of gene expression is a key mechanism for control of cell growth, differentiation, and development. Defects in activation directly contribute to many human illnesses. Our proposed work will identify conserved and widely used mechanisms for transcriptional activation that will form the molecular basis for understanding regulation of transcriptional programs in normal cells, transcriptional defects leading to human disease, and reveal fundamental information on the mechanism of transcription factors that are the readout of many signaling pathways.",Mechanisms of eukaryotic transcription activation,9735333,R01GM075114,"['Affect ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' cell growth ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Pol II ', ' DNA-Dependent DNA Polymerase II ', ' DNA Polymerase epsilon ', ' DNA Polymerase II ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Reagent ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' RNA Polymerase B ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase II ', ' RNA Polymerase II ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' S cerevisiae ', "" Brewer's Yeast "", "" Baker's Yeast "", ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Syndrome ', ' Tail ', ' Technology ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' base ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Structure ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' Regulation ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' high throughput screening ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' Genomics ', ' Molecular Computations ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcription Initiation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Normal Cell ', ' Housekeeping Gene ', ' Polymerase ', ' SAGA ', ' SPT/ADA/Gcn5 Acetyltransferase ', ' Transcription Coactivator ', ' transcriptional co-activator ', ' transcription co-activator ', ' Transcriptional Coactivator ', ' Transcriptional Activator/Coactivator ', ' Transcriptional Activator ', ' Transcription Factor Coactivator ', ' Transcription Activator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Defect ', ' DNA Binding Domain ', ' DNA-Binding Protein Motifs ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' in vivo ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Transcriptional Activation Domain ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' human disease ', ' protein crosslink ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' recruit ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,527403,0.0988206643151648
"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia ABSTRACT The “preclinical” phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation in the absence of major symptoms, can last decades, and potentially holds the key to successful therapeutic strategies. Today there is an urgent need for quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests that can predict clinical progression at the individual level. This project will develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms that will mine high dimensional, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to derive models that yield individual-level clinical predictions in the context of dementia. The developed prognostic models will specifically utilize ubiquitous and affordable data types: structural brain MRI scans, saliva or blood-derived genome-wide sequence data, and demographic variables (age, education, and sex). Prior research has demonstrated that all these variables are strongly associated with clinical decline to dementia, however to date we have no model that can harvest all the predictive information embedded in these high dimensional data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to compute clinical predictions from high- dimensional biomedical data such as clinical scans. Yet, most prior ML methods were developed for applications where the ``prediction’’ task was about concurrent condition (e.g., discriminate cases and controls); and established risk factors (e.g., age), multiple modalities (e.g., genotype and images) and longitudinal data were not fully exploited. This application’s core innovation will be to develop rigorous, flexible, and practical ML methods that can fully exploit multi-modal, longitudinal, and high- dimensional biomedical data to compute prognostic clinical predictions. The proposed project will build on the PI’s strong background in computational modeling and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. We will employ an innovative Bayesian ML framework that offers the flexibility to handle and exploit real-life longitudinal and multi-modal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternative benchmarks for identifying preclinical individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a statistically rigorous approach for discovery, cross-validation, and benchmarking the developed tools. This project will yield freely distributed, documented, and validated software and models for predicting future clinical progression based on whole-genome, longitudinal structural MRI and demographic data. We believe the algorithms and software we develop will yield invaluable tools for stratifying preclinical AD subjects in drug trials, optimizing future therapies, and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. NARRATIVE Emerging technologies allow us to identify clinically healthy subjects harboring Alzheimer’s pathology. While many of these preclinical individuals progress to dementia, sometimes quite quickly, others remain asymptomatic for decades. The proposed project will develop sophisticated data mining algorithms to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on ubiquitous, easy- to-collect, and affordable data modalities: brain MRI scans, saliva or blood- derived whole-genome sequences, and clinical and demographic variables.","Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and

"Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, affecting 1 in 8 individuals over 65 years old in the US. Within AD, approximately 40-60% individuals are affected by psychotic symptoms (AD+P), which are associated with more rapid cognitive decline, greater disability, mortality and caregiver burden, resulting in a disproportionately large disease burden. Recent studies indicate a genetic basis for AD+P risk, but the molecular basis of AD+P remains largely uncharacterized, hindering the search for appropriate treatments and novel therapeutics. In this proposal, we seek to systematically dissect the mechanistic basis of AD+P by systematic generation, integration, and experimental dissection of transcriptional and epigenomic phenotypes across two brain regions and four cell types. (1) We profile single-cell RNA-seq and cell-type specific H3K27ac ChIP-seq across 192 post-mortem brain samples, each in two regions across AD patients with psychosis, AD patients with no psychosis, schizophrenia patients with no AD, and control individuals. (2) We integrate the resulting datasets with genetic information and GWAS data to predict driver genes, regions, variants, and pathways underlying AD+P using state-of-the-art machine learning methods for causality, mediation analysis, and genetic Bayesian fine- mapping. (3) We use our computational predictions to guide a systematic dissection of the molecular underpinnings of AD+P using a modular and programmable CRISPR-Cas9 methodology in iPSC lines to modulate regulatory elements, genes and alleles, and measure the resulting molecular and cellular phenotypes in cell-autonomous and non-autonomous phenotypes. If successful, this ambitious proposal has the potential to provide the first mechanistic insights on the development of psychotic symptoms in AD+P and/or P-AD, reveal functional risk variants and target genes for therapeutic intervention that will likely influence clinical management in order to alleviate the personal and societal burden associated with these disorders.

"Leveraging the Human Non-Coding Transcriptome to Identify Therapeutics for Healthy Aging and Alzheimers Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Age is the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Nevertheless, a majority of individuals do not develop AD by their 9th decade of life. We propose that targeting the endogenous protective mechanisms associated with ‘healthy aging’ represents a sound scientific paradigm for addressing AD prevention, especially if this can be achieved using a combination of pre-existing FDA approved drugs. Our initial models of human aging identified novel transcriptomic signatures of aging, common in human hippocampus and muscle, prompting us to develop an expanded biobank and an updated assay that integrates both protein coding and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) data using novel RNA quantification methods, and extensively phenotyped clinical resources. We have utilized this translational bioinformatics strategy and a novel human biobank to produce a robust prototype screen that successfully identified >100 drugs from in silico analysis using the NIH cMAP/LINCS database, including 29 chemical regulators of a proven longevity pathway (PI3K/mTOR, p<0.00001). We validated this activity in human primary cells. Here, our overarching goal is to refine this screen in a range of human cell models and identify optimal combinations of FDA approved drugs that positively regulate the healthy-aging-related RNA network without the focused need for direct PI3K/mTOR inhibition and hence reduced potential side effects. Through the pursuit of 3 major distinct but interacting aims, the present body of work will enhance the network modeling by incorporating human brain aging lncRNA responses; formatting the current validated assay into a higher-throughput screen able to examine ~5,000-10,000 combinations of individually active drugs. We expect to demonstrate that our strategy can guide repositioning of individual drugs into sets of drug-combinations that ‘switch on’ a healthy-aging profile in human cell systems. NARRATIVE The greatest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is age, and up to 10% of the population develops AD by the age of 65. Since over 1.2 billion people are set to reach 65yr world-wide in the coming two decades, the imminent socioeconomic costs mean that it is extremely urgent to identify practical solutions. We have discovered a healthy-aging molecular signature that is ‘druggable’; and have devised a high-throughput strategy to identify combinations of efficacious FDA-approved drugs that induce that signature. Unlike standard drug-development that is too slow, the present project aims to quickly select ideal drug combinations that might delay or prevent AD and motivate new clinical trials.",Leveraging the

"Functional Regression and Subgroup Analysis for Asynchronous Longitudinal Data. Project Summary / Abstract Asynchronous longitudinal designs have been widely used in studies on aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In these decades-long studies, as longitudinal variables were routinely collected from different platforms (e.g. food frequency questionnaires, lab results and clinical or psychological tests), the obtained data were not synchronized in time even for the same subject. As part of the motivating Normative Aging Study (NAS), it was of substantial interest to address whether dietary intake of niacin was associated with incident AD and cognitive decline. In the study, four cognitive tests were administered to participants in a span of 6 years after participation, and nutrient intake was determined by food frequency questionnaires distributed at the baseline and between adjacent cognitive tests. As a result, the exposure variables, including nutrient intake, and the outcomes of cognitive tests, were measured asynchronously. Naive analyses ignoring the mistiming issue will lead to biased results and wrong conclusion. In addition, the development of aging-associated diseases tends to differ in various (latent) subpopulations, where associations between disease progression and biomarkers and environmental exposures vary substantially across subpopulations. Subgroup analyses in aging populations are crucial for developing better strategies of preventing, treating and managing aging-associated diseases, such as AD.  Accounting for the peculiar nature of the NAS data, the proposed methods will help address the key question on the association between dietary intake of niacin and incident AD in the NAS. We will also examine other biomarkers and environmental exposures associated with AD. The proposed subgroup analysis will also help identify latent subgroups within the aging population and discern subgroup-specific risk factors leading to cognitive impairment. Unlike the existing work relying on restrictive model assumptions, the proposed methods are fully nonparametric, data adaptive and can be combined with state-of-the-art model selection methods to choose relevant risk factors for AD from hundreds of variables that might be time varying and asynchronous with the response. Methods and theory developed in this project will be widely applicable to other longitudinal studies. We will also develop new computation tools and software packages that are scalable for large longitudinal data sets with long followups.

"Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology 7. Project Summary/Abstract  In Alzheimer's disease (AD), irreversible neurological damage takes place years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, it is recognized that the development of AD dementia treatment and prevention strategies relies on the early detection of presymptomatic pathology. Previous studies demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD and precedes the formation of plaques and tangles that are hallmarks of this disease. The premise of this study is based on the unique sensitivity of the brain to systemic bioenergetic decline due to its exceptionally high metabolic demand. We hypothesize that bioenergetic capacity is related to early AD pathology and that bioenergetic decline is associated with the long term progression and severity of this disease. Recent work by our group and others demonstrate that blood- based bioenergetic profiling, utilizing cellular respirometry, provides a reliable measure of systemic mitochondrial function. The proposed study will determine whether blood cell bioenergetics is related to AD risk, pathology, cognitive performance, and changes in these parameters over time. Our long term goal is to develop a minimally invasive screening tool that can be used in a clinic/community setting to identify candidates for more intensive diagnostic testing, such as CSF biomarker analysis and brain imaging.  This project will be completed in an efficient and cost-effective manner by leveraging resources provided by the NIA-funded Wake Forest Alzheimer' Disease Center Clinical Core (ADCCC). Participants in the ADCCC represent a spectrum of AD risk and disease progression and are being extensively characterized for AD pathologies at baseline and 3 year follow ups. Our preliminary data from ADCCC participants indicate that bioenergetic capacity, measured in blood cells, is lower in participants with mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, our data suggest that bioenergetic deficits are already apparent in cognitively normal participants at high risk for AD. The aims of the proposed study are: 1) To determine bioenergetic profiles most strongly associated with AD risk and reporters of AD pathology (cognitive performance, CSF Aβ42/tau, hippocampal volume, brain amyloid, and cerebral glucose metabolism); 2) To determine the changes in bioenergetic profiles related to the 3 year progression of cognitive decline and reporters of AD pathology; and, 3) To determine the relationships of mitochondrial content and inflammation with bioenergetic capacity, and reporters of AD pathology at baseline and at follow-up. A central goal of the proposed study is to determine the specific bioenergetic parameters that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Therefore, in addition to convention analytical approaches, we will employ state of the art Machine Learning analyses to identify individual parameters or multivariate signatures that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Completion of this project can impact the detection of presymptomatic AD, provide insights into mechanisms underlying bioenergetic decline associated with AD, and broadly advance translational bioenergetics research. 8. Project Narrative  It is widely recognized that the implementation of successful Alzheimer's disease prevention and treatment strategies rely on the identification of patients at risk for developing the disease. The proposed project will examine blood based bioenergetic profiling as a minimally invasive strategy for determining Alzheimer's disease risk and presymptomatic pathology.

"Assessing ASL CBF as a biomarker for early Alzheimer's disease detection and disease progression ABSTRACT. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting tens of millions of people. A top research priority in AD is to find a biomarker sensitive to early disease and disease progression because that will likely provide the best opportunities for searching and evaluating effective treatments for this currently incurable brain disease. Human brain relies on cerebral blood flow (CBF) for its energy supply and waste removal. Previous research has indicated that CBF reductions cause neuron inactivity and neurotoxic waste accumulation and subsequently neuron death, which may eventually lead to AD dementia. Measuring CBF and following its longitudinal course may then provide a highly potential biomarker for early AD and its progression. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI is a technique for quantifying CBF without using exogenous tracers. Because it is relatively cheaper and can be repeated many times, it is well suited for longitudinal AD research. Sensitivity of ASL MRI to AD and prodromal AD has been shown in many cross-sectional studies (comparing AD to controls) by other groups and us. But several important questions still remain unanswered including the prediction power of ASL CBF for early AD and AD progression, the longitudinal CBF change patterns, and sex difference of CBF in AD. Addressing those questions needs large size longitudinal data and expertise for analyzing ASL MRI data due to the low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The purpose of this project is to address those open questions by leveraging our extensive expertise on ASL MRI and the accumulating longitudinal ASL data from ADNI (a large ongoing multi-site AD neuroimaging study). The novel information or outcome from this project will include the prediction power of ASL CBF for early AD, CBF change rate when disease progresses or reverts, gender effects in AD and its progression, and a next-generation ASL MRI processing algorithm based on deep-machine learning (DL), and a DL-based AD prediction model. We will first confirm our previous ADNI ASL CBF findings using larger sample and updated methods (not available before). We will then check sensitivity of ASL CBF for tracking and predicting disease progression or cognitive declines. Gender effects on CBF in AD will be explicitly examined, which may reveal a clue for the higher prevalence of AD in females. We will revisit those studies using the DL-based ASL denoising algorithm. Pursuing those aims will help establishing ASL CBF as an AD biomarker and provide a versatile AD prediction model using ASL CBF as well as other valuable biomarkers provided in ADNI. Developing and sharing the DL ASL MRI denoising method will benefit not only AD research but also the various scientific projects based on ASL MRI. The feasibility of this innovative but clinically important project is ensured by our decades of experience and the substantial pilot investigations in each aspect of the study, including ASL MRI, AD ASL study, and machine learning. Identifying biomarkers sensitive to early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its progression is central to AD studies. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) will be measured using arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI and assessed for early AD detection and progression monitoring. We will also develop a next-generation ASL denoising technique to further improve ASL CBF SNR and reliability. Given our aging population and the increasing prevalence of AD, performing this project is likely to have significant public health impact. Developing the proposed technique will benefit not only AD study but the general neuroimaging research.",Assessing ASL CBF as a biomarker for early Alzheimer's disease detection and disease

"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Successful development of small vessel disease (SVD) biomarkers will advance public health by changing the landscape of research, diagnosis, and treatment in vascular and AD dementias, which commonly have mixed pathologies. SVD biomarkers will specifically refine participant selection in clinical trials, improve diagnosis of the most common types of dementia, and advance target selection in studies of the prevention and treatment of dementia in older persons.",Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia.,9768245,UH3NS100599,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' infarct ', ' Infarction ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Sclerosis ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' cerebrovascular amyloidosis ', ' Congophilic Angiopathy ', ' Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Collaborations ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Prevention ', ' neuropathology ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' White Matter Disease ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' data sharing ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' vascular risk factor ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Prevention trial ', ' cognitive ability ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' MRI biomarker ', ' protective factors ', ' in vivo evaluation ', ' in vivo testing ', ' pathology imaging ', ' ']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH3,2019,1152217,0.07678172258705646
"TMS in preclinical and prodromal AD: Modulation of brain networks and memory Project Summary  In the prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD), beta-amyloid (AB) and tau preferentially spread throughout the default mode network (DMN) leading to neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction. Episodic memory impairments in AD are thought to arise from the loss of structural and functional connectivity between nodes of the DMN. Emerging evidence from studies with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in young adults demonstrate that the DMN can be modulated in a manner that promotes lasting episodic memory improvement. However, several fundamental questions remain regarding the factors that govern whether rTMS is effective in patients with Alzheimer's pathology and neurodegeneration.  The primary goal of this proposal is to refine our understanding of the mechanisms and therapeutic potential of rTMS for enhancing DMN integrity and episodic memory in individuals with Alzheimer's pathology. 30 patients with prodromal AD, 30 AB+ cognitively normal older adults, and 30 AB- cognitively normal older adults will each undergo 5 days of sham-controlled rTMS preceded and followed by multimodal MRI sessions and cognitive testing. rTMS targets will be established using baseline functional connectivity derived from resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) to determine the region in lateral parietal cortex with maximal functional connectivity to the hippocampus. rsfMRI outcome measures will include functional connectivity between the stimulation site and hippocampus, and intrinsic activity within the stimulation site and hippocampus. AB, tau, and FDG positron emission tomography (PET) scans and structural MRI will be used to quantify the impact of Alzheimer's pathology, hypometabolism, and atrophy on the efficacy of rTMS treatments in each group. All outcome measures will be related to behavioral measures of episodic memory immediately and 2 weeks after the end of treatment. Aim 1 of the proposed project will establish the effects of rTMS on episodic memory in each group. Aim 2 will establish functional network effects of rTMS in each group. Aim 3 will use multivariate regression and machine learning algorithms to identify the biological features that are most useful in predicting whether an individual will benefit from rTMS.  All data collection and analyses will take place at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. During the completion of the project the candidate will receive training in the theory and application of TMS to modulate network function, the use of PET imaging to measure pathology in AD, clinical trial design, and the use of advanced biostatistics for biomarker development and treatment response prediction. The outcome of this research will provide insight into the individuals that are most likely to benefit from rTMS, and will inform future studies seeking to optimize rTMS treatments to improve cognition in dementia. Furthermore, the completion of this project will lay the foundation for the candidate's long-term goal of translating basic neuroimaging findings from healthy aging to direct benefits for patients with Alzheimer's disease. The proposed research examines the potential benefits of non-invasive repetitive transcranial brain stimulation (rTMS) to behavior and memory neurocircuitry in older adults and patients with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. The outcome of this research will provide critical insight into the individuals that are most likely to benefit from rTMS, and to inform future studies seeking to optimize rTMS treatments to improve cognition in dementia. This project is consistent with the NIA’s strategic goal of developing interventions to address Alzheimer’s disease and other age-related neurological conditions",TMS in preclinical and prodromal AD:

"Effects of Biomedical Risk Factors on Neuro-cognition Using MRI: Long term follow-up of the Diabetes Control & Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Study Cohort Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD) are responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality, and are expected to pose an increasing burden because the US population is aging. Technological advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and analytic algorithms facilitate increasingly precise measurement and characterization of structural and functional brain changes that may be early indicators of pathologic processes leading to AD/ADRD. Early detection of these changes is critical during preclinical stages before the pathologic change has advanced to an irreversible state, as this is a period when treatment may be most effective. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) appears to accelerate the trajectory of brain aging. As Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients live longer, they might be at increased risk for AD/ADRD but little is known about the impact of T1DM on accelerated brain aging and ADRD. We are responding to NOT-AG-18-039 to seek an administrative supplement to DP3114812 -(Effects of Biomedical Risk Factors on Neuro-cognition Using MRI) to leverage the long term follow-up of the Diabetes Control & Complications Trial (DCCT)/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Study (EDIC) Cohort to investigate associations with AD-related changes on brain MRI. The participants have been studied for over 35 years, with detailed longitudinal biomedical and cognitive data gathered from baseline and are entering the age of increased risk for AD/ADRD. Our project addresses action item 1.C.1 of the National Alzheimer's Project Act 2018 update: identify imaging and biomarkers to monitor disease progression. Enhanced neuroimaging methods for early diagnosis can serve as foundations for designing and following subjects in clinical trials and selecting patients at greatest risk for therapeutic interventions. The primary goal of this supplement is to evaluate the presence of AD-like patterns of brain atrophy in the DCCT/EDIC population. We plan to construct robust imaging markers of clinical and preclinical AD, as well as to systematically characterize the heterogeneity of brain aging and its associations with various risk factors by leveraging multiple advances since the original proposal including a large NIA-funded study led by our group that pools together data from approximately 20,000 individuals, called iSTAGING. These new advances will permit us to develop a new focus on ADRD, addressing our Specific Aims: 1) Harmonize the EDIC MRI datasets with a large brain aging and AD consortium (iSTAGING), using state of the art statistical imaging analytics methods, as well as an enriched set of healthy control individuals scanned in the same sites and by the same protocol. 2) Evaluate the presence of patterns of brain atrophy that have been established in MCI and AD, and to relate those patterns to biomedical predictors and cognitive decline in EDIC. This plan builds upon the currently funded project to now include explicit ADRD research objectives. Our study will help determine whether T1DM is associated with pre-clinical brain imaging patterns of AD. The effects of type 1 diabetes on brain structure and thinking processes are poorly understood and understudied especially among the growing population of older patients who are at greatest risk for these problems. The Diabetes Control & Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions & Complications (DCCT/EDIC) study affords an unparalleled opportunity to use blood sugar control and other information gathered over a 30 year period from early in the course of illness, among this well-characterized group of patients, to examine important and unresolved questions about the frequency and causes of these problems using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and cognitive testing. By achieving these aims we will determine key predictors of neuro-cognitive impairments and guide strategies to mitigate this risk, and address a topic of considerable concern, for which little definitive information is available to clinicians and patients, particularly those with long-standing type 1 diabetes who are over 50 years of age.",Effects of Biomedical Risk Factors on Neuro-cognition Using MRI: Long term follow-up of the Diabetes Control & Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Study Cohort,9879993,DP3DK114812,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type one diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1DM ', ' T1D ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1 DM ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Lipids ', ' Literature ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Study of magnetics ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Harnessing Diverse BioInformatic Approaches to Repurpose Drugs for Alzheimers Disease Abstract The exploration of genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes derived from brains with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by powerful computational tools has the potential of developing new knowledge, including the identification of pathways and targets that may be involved in the initiation and/or progression of the disease. The challenge is to find drugs that impact those pathways, and then validate the importance of those pathways – distinguishing primary disease drivers from secondary events. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to probe potential pathways in proof of concept, and ultimately therapeutic, clinical trials. Here, we propose to discover and validate hypotheses for drug repurposing in AD through three integrated, complementary informatics approaches. Specifically, we will apply classical and network aware (prior-loaded) machine learning approaches to identify pathways and targets altered in AD brains at different stages of disease progression using data from Accelerating Medicines Partnership-AD available through Synapse (Aim 1); we will use systems pharmacology approaches to discover the target selectivity of lead compounds in human neuronal and glial cell types using unbiased RNA-seq, proteomic and imaging studies followed by pathway analysis (Aim 2). Each of these two Aims has two approaches: data-driven, hypothesis-generating analyses to discern disease-relevant drug signals; and hypothesis-testing in which positive findings from one approach are evaluated using the other approaches to assess rigor and reproducibility. Moreover, RNA-seq and proteomic data collected in cultured human CNS cell types following exposure to potential disease drivers and/or FDA-approved drugs in Aim 2 will be fed back into Aim 1 as CNS-cell type-derived priors to refine the predictive models. In Aim 3, we will develop new informatics strategies to conduct in-silico drug trials in EHR data with “prospective” outcomes to validate hypotheses based on the omics data sets and extant literature, using two big data sets: the UK 20 year CPRD longitudinal records of 20M National Health Service patients, and the RPDR Database (based at Partners Healthcare) with 6 M individuals followed for over 20 years. This integrated informatics program compensates for the limitations of each individual informatics approach to promote discovery and critical evaluation of “lead compounds” for known and novel AD pathways. To execute this strategy, we have assembled a multi-site, multi-disciplinary team with expertise ranging from clinical care to computer science and systems pharmacology. Some of the team members are AD experts and others bring an outsider's perspective. Finally, as a deliverable, we will create open-source data packages to release all the supporting evidence, software, and data with provenance in accordance with FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible) standards through Synapse and the AlzDataLens platform developed at MGH (Aim 4). These data packages will help to prioritize follow on clinical and translational studies including collaborations with industry or members of the community at large involved in new clinical trials. Project Narrative Repurposing existing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to accelerating proof-of-concept and ultimately therapeutic clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We propose a bioinformatics campaign, parallel to a traditional drug campaign, using available expression data from AD brains in the public domain as our “laboratory” and electronic heath records(EHR) as our “clinical trial infrastructure”. Resulting data packages from these analyses will be shared on Open Science platforms and will help to prioritize follow on clinical and translational studies, ultimately leading to new clinical trials.",Harnessing Diverse BioInformatic Approaches to Repurpose Drugs for Alzheimers Disease,9789798,R01AG058063,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary

"Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a growing epidemic, and potential treatments are unlikely to be effective unless deployed during the earliest stages of AD, prior to cognitive symptoms. Currently there are no inexpensive, non-invasive biomarkers for effective AD screening necessary for early recognition and treatment on a broad scale. Sleep is abnormal in preclinical AD, even prior to cognitive symptoms, and disrupted sleep may in turn accelerate AD pathological mechanisms. Electroencephalography (EEG) directly measures brain function, and the stereotyped nature of sleep EEG offers a particularly rich opportunity to identify biomarkers of brain dysfunction due to AD. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that sleep-wake brain mechanisms are abnormal very early in AD, and can be detected via subtle but distinct sleep and EEG changes. The objective is to develop sleep and EEG biomarkers of AD, to enable non-invasive and inexpensive screening on a large scale, through the following specific aims.  Aim 1) Identify sleep-wake patterns across the 24-hour day characteristic of AD pathology. Ambulatory sleep-EEG data will be recorded over the 24-hour period in the home setting from a large, diverse, community-based cohort, with the hypothesis that increased sleep-wake transitions over the 24-hour day are characteristic of preclinical-to-mild AD. Aim 2) Assess slow wave integrity measures as biomarkers of AD pathology. EEG abnormalities of slow wave sleep are particularly associated with elevated amyloid-β levels and plaques. Novel analytic techniques will extract bihemispheric slow wave coherence, slow wave velocity, and slow wave intradaily ratio from EEG data collected during sleep and wake. The hypothesis is that amyloid plaques present in early AD will reduce slow wave integrity by all three measures. Aim 3) Determine the EEG signature of AD using machine learning. Machine learning techniques will be applied to EEG from a full attended overnight polysomnogram, to identify a “signature” of AD pathology. The goal is to identify a “signature” that can be detected with spatially limited EEG data that could be collected at home.  The expected outcome of these aims is to identify sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD that can be detected noninvasively and inexpensively at home. The impact of our work will be the ability to screen large populations easily for AD pathology, so that affected individuals can be identified and treated. Moreover, sleep-EEG biomarkers could be used to track disease progression and treatment response in clinical trials for AD. Lastly, since sleep disturbance has a direct effect on AD pathology, by identifying sleep-EEG changes very early in the pathological process, we may be able to intervene, improve sleep, and potentially change the trajectory of AD.  ! Project Narrative Combating the looming crisis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) will require identifying and treating individuals with AD even before cognitive symptoms appear. The proposed project will develop sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD in a large, diverse, community-based cohort, which can be used for inexpensive, non-invasive screening for AD on a broad scale. This project will enable large-scale screening and treatment of early AD, use of sleep-EEG theranostic biomarkers for clinical and drug-development purposes, and intervention for sleep disturbances to potentially change the trajectory of AD.",Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease,9785356,R01AG059507,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Amyloid deposition ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathology ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' poor sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Lumbar Puncture ', ' Spinal Puncture ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' amyloid-b protein ', ' amyloid beta ', ' abeta ', ' a beta peptide ', ' Aβ ', ' Amyloid β-Protein ', ' Amyloid β-Peptide ', ' Amyloid β ', ' Amyloid Protein A4 ', ' Amyloid Beta-Peptide ', "" Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein "", "" Alzheimer's amyloid "", "" Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein "", ' Alzheimer beta-Protein ', ' Amyloid beta-Protein ', ' Measures ', ' τ Proteins ', ' tau factor ', ' tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' tau Proteins ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Slow-Wave Sleep ', ' Delta Wave sleep ', ' Delta Wave ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Staging ', ' Senile Plaques ', ' diffuse plaque ', ' cored plaque ', ' aβ plaques ', ' amyloid-b plaque ', ' amyloid beta plaque ', ' Neuritic Plaques ', ' Amyloid Plaques ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' cognitive function ', ' Hour ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurobehavioral Manifestations ', ' neurobehavioral symptom ', ' Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms ', ' Cognitive Symptoms ', ' Cognitive Manifestations ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' sleep problem ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' sleep dysfunction ', ' Napping ', ' response ', ' sleep onset ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Drug Development ', ' Clinical Drug Testing/Development ', ' Collection ', ' Scheme ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' amyloid imaging ', ' Alzheimer disease screening ', ' Alzheimer screening ', ' combat ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' theranostics ', ' screening ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' sleep quality ', ' quality of sleep ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' sleep pattern ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,383354,0.2867538612344037
"Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS) Project Summary While the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increases with advancing age, approximately 5% of AD patients develop symptoms before age 65 (~280,000 Americans). The vast majority (90%-95%) of EOAD patients do not have a known mutation in APP or PSEN1/2, and only ~50% are APOE4 carriers. Unlike late-onset AD (LOAD), 30-64% of EOAD have non-amnestic presentations, leading to missed or delayed diagnosis. Despite being highly motivated and having few comorbidities, EOAD patients are commonly excluded from large scale observational biomarker studies (e.g. ADNI and DIAN) and therapeutic trials due to their young age, non- amnestic deficits, or absence of known pathogenic mutations. Furthermore, studies suggest high heritability in EOAD in the absence of known mutations or APOE4, signifying that this population may be enriched for novel genetic risk factors. Emerging biomarkers of amyloid and tau have not been systematically characterized in this population. Clinical and neuroimaging measures employed in LOAD may be insensitive to baseline deficits and disease progression in EOAD, which predominantly involve non-memory cognitive domains and posterior cortical neurodegeneration. To fill this gap in AD research, we plan to recruit and longitudinally follow 400 amyloid PET- positive EOAD subjects meeting NIA-AA criteria for MCI due to AD or probable AD dementia (including primary amnestic, dysexecutive, language and visuospatial presentations) and 100 age-matched controls. Participants in the Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer’s Disease Study (LEADS) will undergo clinical assessments, psychometric testing, MRI, amyloid ([18F]Florbetaben) and tau ([18F]AV1451) PET, CSF and blood draw for collection of DNA, RNA, plasma, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Patients will be assessed at three time points – baseline (both EOAD and controls), 12 months (EOAD all measures; controls – clinical and cognitive measures only) and 24 months (EOAD, all measures except PET). Methods will be harmonized with ADNI and DIAN. We will comprehensively characterize cognitive, imaging and biofluid changes over time in EOAD, and compare to a matched sample of LOAD participants identified in ADNI. We will employ machine learning algorithms to develop sensitive clinical and imaging measures of EOAD progression. An exploratory aim will apply next generation sequencing to assess for novel genetic risk factors for disease. The study will also establish a network of EOAD research sites and set the stage for the launch of clinical trials in this population. Project Narrative Patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD), occurring before age 65, are an understudied segment of the population of patients with AD, and many treatment studies exclude these younger individuals. In this project, we plan to recruit and follow more than 400 people with EOAD in order to better understand changes in thinking abilities, changes in the brain, and changes in blood and spinal fluid, with the goal of using this information to design new treatment trials inclusive of this segment of the AD population.",Early Onset AD Consortium - the LEAD Study (LEADS),9854017,U01AG057195,"['Age ',

"Developing mobile software that uses visual mapping techniques as habit-based assistive technology for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's related dementias and their caregivers Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) are age-associated neurodegenerative diseases that are reaching epidemic proportions. Progression of AD is characterized by losses in memory, orientation, independent decision-making capacity, and self-care. Gains in understanding AD pathogenesis have not yet translated into pharmacological therapies that effectively slow or halt disease progression. Evidence-based behavioral approaches are rapidly becoming recognized as methods to provide effective neurocognitive and therapeutic support for AD/ADRD patients and their caregivers1.  Behavioral approaches such as lifestyle changes and risk reduction are non-pharmacological therapies that are accessible, personalizable, have no side effects, and are low in cost. To that end, we are developing mobile device software that is patient and caregiver centered, and provides behavioral-based assistance through visual mapping. The MapHabitTM system (MHS) uses pictures and keywords to assist memory- impaired patients and caregivers in organizing and successfully accomplishing their activities of daily living. This approach is innovative through its unique recruitment of the brain’s habit learning system (neostriatum) rather than the hippocampal structures damaged in AD. Preliminary work revealed that commercially available visual mapping software is too complicated for memory-impaired and technology-naïve individuals to use effectively. Commercially available software is proprietary and cannot be modified to meet their needs.  In this Phase 1 SBIR application, we propose to further develop and enhance MHS by integrating three novel specific aims that involve (1) development of adaptive user interfaces which can be personalized and dynamically adjusted for cognitive status, allowing for a greater range of memory-impaired individuals to benefit from visual mapping; (2) linkage of personalized visual maps to smart devices, including wearables (e.g., Apple iWatch) and audio interfaces (e.g., Amazon Echo); (3) establishment of a predictive analytics tool that will accurately track and predict changes in functional status.  We are advantaged in this SBIR Phase 1 application by having access to patients and caregivers, including underrepresented minority populations, who are currently involved in our preliminary studies assessing the impact of visual mapping on quality of life measures. All of these individuals are already well- characterized in terms of their cognitive and emotional behavior, both before and after the use of visual mapping (see letters of support from Dr. E. Vaughn, Atlanta VA Health Care System, Dr. M. Parker, Emory University Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, and F. Boatman, RN, Speak Life Management). Those studies will contribute to the preliminary data section of our planned SBIR Phase 2 application that will: assess the effectiveness of MHS on a broad range of large clinical populations, improve the user-experience for memory-impaired individuals, and refine our methods of machine learning to predict healthcare outcomes. Impressive gains in our understanding of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have not created therapies that are safe and effective. We are developing the MapHabitTM system, an application for mobile devices that is safe, non- invasive, and low in cost, which helps memory-impaired individuals and caregivers accomplish activities and improve independent function. This is done by using a technique called visual mapping to utilize areas of the brain that are not damaged by AD.",Developing mobile software that uses visual mapping techniques as habit-based assistive technology for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's related dementias and their caregivers,9848374,R43AG065081,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Age ', ' ages ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Feedback ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Learning ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' assistive device ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Universities ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Businesses ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Neostriatum ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Memory impairment ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Visual ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' functional status ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Touch sensation ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Bypass ', ' Memory Loss ', ' memory decline ', ' Modeling ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Apple ', ' Malus domestica ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' habit learning ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Population ', ' visual map ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' analytical tool ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' decision-making capacity ', ' emotional behavior ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' recruit ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' Nonpharmacologic Therapy ', ' Non-pharmacologic Therapy ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NIA,"MAPHABIT, INC.",R43,2019,466033,0.08070524055141144
"Rapid Profiling of the Plasma Proteome and Machine Learning Analytics for Non-Invasive Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease ABSTRACT The main objective of this project is to develop an innovative blood-based test for highly sensitive and specific, non-invasive and cost-efficient diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which would leverage Seer's proprietary Proteograph platform enabled by the convergence of nanotechnology, protein corona, proteomics, and data science. Beyond neuropsychological testing, two approaches have thus far been clinically validated for AD detection, including neuroimaging and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based biomarkers (e.g., amyloid-β or Aβ). In contrast to the neuroimaging (which is expensive and time-consuming) and CSF analysis (which is less expensive, but involves an invasive lumbar puncture procedure), a blood-based test for AD diagnosis has the potential to be dramatically less costly and easier to implement. Nevertheless, the search for reliable blood- based biomarkers has been challenging and the blood-based detection using ELISA or other epitope-based methods that go after a few biomarkers (e.g., Aβ42 or Tau) have not been successful, presumably owing to the vast dynamic range and high complexity of the plasma components. We have recently demonstrated that our multi-nanoparticle (NP) protein corona technology can facilitate broad and deep profiling of plasma proteome, and by combining with machine learning approaches, could lead to the development of Proteograph classifiers for highly accurate detection of different diseases including AD. As compared to current mass spectrometry- based proteomic techniques that require complex and time-consuming depletion or fractionation workflows for detection of low abundance/rare proteins, our multi-NP protein corona strategy is fast and high-throughput for analysis of the vast body of information in the proteome. In this Direct Phase II project, we will build upon the proof-of-concept studies to further test how Seer's Proteograph platform can be applied to develop a robust blood-based test to detect AD. Specifically, we will identify a panel (~6-10) of NPs from Seer's NP library for broad and deep coverage of the plasma proteome of AD patients (Aim 1); develop Proteograph classifiers and identify the proteins critical for classification through machine learning of the proteomic data generated from the panel of NPs with a cohort of 150 plasma samples of AD and healthy controls (Aim 2); and validate the accuracy of the detection test (based on the important proteins identified in Aim 2) in a separate blind cohort of 450 Aβ-positive AD patients and healthy controls (Aim 3). We expect that the successful completion of this SBIR project will lead to the clinical use of a blood-based AD test, which could further benefit earlier treatment, therapeutic outcomes, and health costs and quality of life for the elderly. NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the 6th-leading cause of death in the United States, and it is projected that nearly 14 million Americans will be living with AD by 2050, according to the Alzheimer's Association, translating to a healthcare cost of ~$1.1 trillion. Accurate and early identification of AD, ideally at the earliest symptomatic or even pre-symptomatic stage, could facilitate better monitoring of therapy response and better planning for the care of family members with the disease, thus offering a tremendous economic impact. In this Direct Phase II SBIR project, we will develop a highly sensitive and specific, non-invasive, and cost-effective blood-based test for routine diagnosis of AD, which represents one of the greatest medical challenges of this era.",Rapid Profiling of the Plasma Proteome and Machine Learning Analytics for Non-Invasive Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,9846720,R44AG065051,"['Elderly ', '

"Systems-level functional proteomics analysis assemblies in Alzheimer's disease and mouse models of tauopathy The goal of this proposal is to comprehensively map and identify the subnetworks of synaptic protein complexes that are central players in the synaptic dysfunction occurring with neurodegeneration. We will use the emerging power of quantitative network proteomics in the Emili laboratory to systematically characterize the major protein assemblies present at normal and diseased synapses on a proteome scale. This research will be propelled by discoveries from the Wolozin laboratory demonstrating that a dynamic network of protein interactions drives tau biology and changes with the course of disease. Interpreting these perturbed assembly networks, though, demands knowledge of the localization and compositional specificity of such complexes. The unbiased interactome screening technology developed by the Emili laboratory is uniquely suited for unbiased interrogations of synaptic protein networks. We hypothesize that selective disruption of specific synaptic protein assemblies mediates the functional degeneration associated with tauopathy. Aim 1 will determine how synaptic protein complexes differ between general cortical and cholinergic neurons. We will isolate and biochemical separate synaptic assemblies from total cortical and cholinergic (ChAT::GFP) synapses, using FACS to further purify ChAT:GFP synapses. Separated assemblies will be characterized by precision mass spectrometry and integrative data mining (machine learning) procedures to determine their composition and post- translational modification states, and to map dynamically changing interactions implicated in altered synaptic function during normal aging. Aim 2 will determine how the macromolecular structures of synaptic protein assemblies change with aging and AD. We will analyze cortical synaptosomal complexes from P301S tau and P301S tau x TIA1+/- mice, the latter which exhibited delayed degeneration. Key drivers in synaptic dysfunction will be identified and verified in AD and control human samples by co-immunoprecipitation. Aim 3 will identify complexes that are critical drivers of synaptic function by disrupting prioritized assemblies using genetic and opticogenetic tools. This work will determine key regulators of synaptic function in health and disease, and will also produce expanded genetic tools and outstanding targets for future approaches using bio-engineered regulation.

"Network Modelling of Multimodal Dynamics in Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is caused by misfolded proteins that march through brain circuits trans-neuronally, causing stereotyped patterns of damage to the brain over decades of progression, and increasing clinical and cognitive impairments. Using new imaging techniques, spatiotemporal mapping of the biomarkers of AD, including of atrophy, metabolism, and pathology deposition, are becoming possible. However, the precise relationship of these biomarkers to each other is not known. These factors, coupled with insidious onset, clinical heterogeneity, overlap with other dementias and variability in progression, make a rigorous characterization and prognosis difficult. Although the “trans-neuronal” mechanism of pathology naturally suggests that pathology spread must follow the brain's fiber connectivity, existing methods of predicting progression and cognitive decline do not currently exploit the network information, relying instead on phenomenological or statistical approaches unanchored in the biophysics of networked spread. These gaps hinder understanding of the biophysical mechanism underlying dementias, and preclude accurate quantitative predictors of patients' future trajectory. The objective of this application is to learn, test and apply biophysical models of networked spread in AD. Our central hypothesis is that once a patient's baseline disease status is known, all subsequent disease-related processes are enacted on the brain's fiber connectivity network, i.e. the “connectome”, in a fully predictable manner. Influence of genetic and environmental actors is already factored in the baseline data. This project will build on and extend our recent novel graph theoretic Network Diffusion model, which mathematically captures the process of trans-neuronal network spread, and is ideally suited for investigating these issues. With this network model as a foundation, we will bring together all key elements of the causal AD progression chain. Then, using human imaging data (atrophy from MRI, Aβ from AV45-PET, tau from T807-PET and metabolism from FDG-PET) from the public ADNI study, we will mathematically characterize 1) network-based spread of tau and amyloid-beta, 2) the relationship between tau deposition and regional atrophy, and amyloid deposition and regional metabolism. Next, these validated models will be entered in a state-space generative mode of progression that will predict future spatial patterns of the biomarkers. An alternative deep learning approach will also be developed as a comparison with the proposed biophysical modeling approach. Success of this proposal could have wide implications in treatment, care, planning and monitoring of dementia in susceptible populations. Our long-term goal is to develop a common connectome-based biophysics model underlying all dementias, forming the core of novel computational diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. NARRATIVE Alzheimer's Disease is the most widespread and debilitating age-related degenerative disorder, with more than 40 million elderly subjects affected worldwide and $600 billion in care-related expenses. This project will investigate the network spread of the pathogens involved in the disease, and from that information, build a tracking and predictive software. If successful, this will give a computational diagnostic and prognostic tool with wide implications in the treatment, care, planning and monitoring of dementia in susceptible populations.",Network

"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",9694279,R01LM012535,"['positron

"Longitudinal Analysis for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in elderly people worldwide. Due to the fact that the longitudinal abnormality associated with AD can be detected in vivo, neuroimaging measures have been playing an increasingly important role in searching for biomarkers of AD that can be used for early diagnosis, progression monitoring, and therapy responses measurement. The goal of this project is to create a set of cutting-edge computational tools for identifying very early biomarkers of AD and alert AD progression via longitudinal image analysis. The key to achieve high sensitivity and specificity AD diagnosis of individuals is the stable longitudinal measurements. In light of this, the candidate will first develop a novel learning-based 4D (3D+t) landmark detector (Aim 1) to find the landmark locations at all time points simultaneously. The trajectories of landmark set form a compact 4D shape representation to achieve temporal consistency in registering longitudinal image sequence to the template (Aim 2). As a result, the consistency of low level features extracted from MR or PET images can be significantly improved. Since the subject-specific patterns of structural/functional changes, although more relevant to AD diagnosis of individuals, is very subtle compared to huge variation across subjects, the candidate will further develop a supervised deep neural network to learn the latent high-level spatial-temporal patterns by coupled stacked auto-encoder and temporal max pooling (Aim 2). The learned spatial-temporal morphological patterns consist of (1) cross- sectional features from MR and PET images, and (2) dynamic short/long term longitudinal patterns w.r.t. different number of historical time points. In a clinical setting, not all patients have a large and complete set of neuroimaging data, or an equal number of imaging scans. In order to eventually translate to clinic arena, a novel AD detector that uses a spatial-temporal hyper-graph learning framework (Aim 3) is proposed to not only provide high sensitivity and specificity in AD diagnosis but also solve the above difficulties. To evaluate the diagnostic value, we will apply our trained AD detector to ADNI dataset and patient data collected in UNC (Aim 3). Finally, we will package all our developed methods into a software package and release it freely to the neuroimaging community, to facilitate other AD-biomarker-exploration projects performed in other institutes. Project Narrative This proposal aims for the development of novel neuroimaging analysis methods for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using longitudinal image data. In particular, a set of automated algorithms will be created to aid the difficult task of analyzing subtle and complex morphological change patterns of Alzheimer's disease during the disease progression. The successful completion of this project will represent an import milestone in neuroimaging research by bringing forth the fruition of a powerful and practical system for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at individual level, for potential effective treatment.",Longitudinal Analysis for Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,9706076,K01AG049089,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Evolution ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Fruit ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Deformity ', ' Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Anatomic Abnormality ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Location ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' interest ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' Graph ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' image registration ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' task analysis ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' functional loss ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' Structural defect ', ' structural anomalies ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' Structural malformation ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging marker ', ' individual patient ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' inter-individual variation ', ' interindividual variation ', ' inter-individual variability ', ' frontotemporal degeneration ', ' high dimensionality ', ' serial imaging ', ' longitudinal imaging ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' autoencoder ', ' autoencoding neural network ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' ']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K01,2019,117098,0.3243259608580496
"ALZ-Stage: Artificial intelligence driven technology with adaptive suite of personalized tests to detect and determine progressive stage of Alzheimers disease Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia to occur in elderly populations around the globe, currently affecting over 30 million people worldwide. As the U.S. elderly population continues to increase, the incidence of AD rises as well, as there is no known neuroprotective therapy or cure. The most common symptoms include memory loss, cognitive impairment, disorientation, and psychiatric issues. The initial diagnosis is achieved through a combination of clinical criteria including a neurological examination, mental status tests and brain imaging. However, these strategies are challenging for detection of early AD or patients with mild symptoms, specifically during the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. Mental status tests and subjective journals, kept by patients or caregivers, are often used to track AD progression, but have low sensitivity and reliability for clinical trials. The most strongly established biomarkers for AD, including amyloid beta, tau protein, and phosphorylated tau, are all obtained thru CSF requiring invasive lumbar puncture.  ALZ-Stage technology will provide a convenient and accessible, yet comprehensive analytics suite to detect and stage Alzheimer's disease progression. The platform will integrate a progressive suite of diagnostic tests using a variety of biological, neurological, and behavioral platforms, subjective and objective inputs, and active and passive test components. The test battery may include blood sample, urine samples, wearable sensors, mobile phone sensors and behavioral tracking. The implementation strategy will progress from lower cost, more readily accessible and passive monitoring devices to more expensive, invasive and burdensome test as likelihood or ALZ stage increases. Unique patient demographics may impact sensitivity. For example, AD incidence in women is twice as high as men. Additionally, based on socio-economic or geographic disparities some populations may only have access to certain types of test equipment or supplies compared to others. Therefore, ALZ-Stage will use AI algorithms not only to detect and stage AD, but will also determine the specific test battery to use based on availability of test options and patient demographics.  The Phase I effort will target the highest risk project component which includes core algorithm development and verification. We will increase likelihood of project success by building on our existing framework that has shown strong feasibility for adaptively predicting test batteries to screen patients for Parkinson's disease. The work will be completed through strong collaboration with our expert technical team at Elder Research and our strong clinical consultants. More specifically, Phase I tasks will focus on developing an array of biomarker test suites for AD, collecting data from a wide range of AD subjects and controls with widely varying demographics, and using that data to build a two layer intelligent algorithm that can determine the most appropriate test battery for a subject and also accurately detect and stage AD during the MCI stage. The objective is to design, develop and demonstrate feasibility of ALZ-Stage, an artificial intelligence driven technology that utilizes an adaptive suite of personalized diagnostic tests to both detect and determine the progressive stage of MCI in Alzheimer's disease. While more than 5.7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's, early and accurate diagnosis can significantly improve outcomes and could save up to $7.9 trillion in healthcare and long-term costs. Therefore, a low-cost, personalized, and widely accessible test suite to detect and stage AD progression would have a significant positive impact on healthcare outcomes and costs, as well as neuroprotective trials aimed at stopping or slowing disease progression.",ALZ-Stage: Artificial intelligence driven technology with adaptive suite of personalized tests to detect and determine progressive stage of Alzheimers disease,9846133,R43AG063581,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cause of Death ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Equipment ', ' Geography ', ' Incidence ', ' Intelligence ', ' Maps ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Neurological Examination ', ' Neurologic Examination ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Lumbar Puncture ', ' Spinal Puncture ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' amyloid-b protein ', ' amyloid beta ', ' abeta ', ' a beta peptide ', ' Aβ ', ' Amyloid β-Protein ', ' Amyloid β-Peptide ', ' Amyloid β ', ' Amyloid Protein A4 ', ' Amyloid Beta-Peptide ', "" Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein "", "" Alzheimer's amyloid "", "" Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein "", ' Alzheimer beta-Protein ', ' Amyloid beta-Protein ', ' τ Proteins ', ' tau factor ', ' tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' tau Proteins ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' sensor ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Disorientation ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Disease Progression ', ' tau-1 ', ' phosphorylated tau ', ' phospho-τ ', ' phospho-tau ', ' p-τ ', ' p-tau ', ' mental state ', ' mental status ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Source ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' monitoring device ', ' success ', ' Memory Loss ', ' memory decline ', ' Sampling ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Monitor ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Alzheimer disease screening ', ' Alzheimer screening ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' personalized diagnostics ', ' precision diagnostics ', ' personalized diagnosis ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' social media ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' improved outcome ', ' common symptom ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' early screening ', ' patient screening ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' implementation strategy ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' ']",NIA,"ELDER RESEARCH, INC.",R43,2019,210140,0.2774239940130171
"Imaging Genomics Based Brain Disease Prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage of Alzheimer Disease (AD), and the existing studies have suggested that the individuals with amnestic MCI tend to progress to probable AD at a rate of approximately 10% to 15% per year. Early prediction of MCI patients with high risk of conversion to AD is of great importance for timely therapy and possible delay of the disease. Recent advances in acquiring multi-dimensional and longitudinal brain imaging and genome-wide array data provide exciting new opportunities to study the influence of genetic variation on brain structure and function. Integrating such multi-dimensional and longitudinal imaging genomic data holds great promise for a system biology of the brain to better understand the complex neurobiological mechanism of conversion of MCI to AD. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these neuroimaging genomic data sets have presented critical computational challenges for achieving the full transformative potential from comprehensive joint analysis of these heterogeneous and longitudinal data sets. This project aims to address these emerging challenges for early prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion with four aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel sparse bi-multivariate learning model based system biology framework for analysis of genome-wide association results across a large number of the structural and functional phenotypes derived from neuroimaging scans of the whole brain. Our new methods are designed for bi-multivariate analysis of high-throughput genomic data and complex Quantitative Traits (QTs) related to MCI-to-AD conversion by utilizing the system biology knowledge. Aim 2 is to further extend the learning approaches in Aim 1 with the new structured sparse models to the multi-dimensional data integration methods to identify the heterogeneous biomarkers from multiscale interrelated imaging genomic data for outcome prediction. Meanwhile, we will utilize the joint multi-task learning scheme to identify the stable genetic and phenotypic biomarkers that are associated with cognitive functions decline and MCI-to-AD conversion simultaneously. Based on the studies in Aims 1 and 2, Aim 3 is focused on revealing the longitudinal biomarkers of the changes of MCI progression or cognitive impairment by a new structured low-rank multi-task regression model. These biomarkers can fully differentiate longitudinal profiles of relevant QTs and better capture genetic associations with QT changes over time. Aim 4 is to evaluate and validate our proposed machine learning and bioinformatics algorithms on both synthetic data and real imaging genomic data. The results of this project will be able to efficiently improve our understanding of the complex neurobiological mechanism underlying the MCI-to-AD conversion. The identified biomarkers will finally enhance the early and accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion such that the clinical treatment can be provided in time. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are at high risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Identifying MCI individuals with high likelihood of conversion to AD is of great importance for timely therapy and possible delay of the disease. Existing research works mainly focus on the studies using single genetic or neuroimaging data source and seldom consider the longitudinal data profiles. To address these limitations, this project focuses on 1) the development of novel bioinformatics and machine learning models for solving the computational challenges of analyzing the emerging multi-dimensional and longitudinal imaging genomic data, and 2) identification of biomarkers with prediction power on MCI-to-AD conversion from the large and complex heterogeneous imaging genomic data

"Algebraic Formulations for Characterizing Structural Brain Connectivity Changes and Pathology Transmission Networks in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY: Accumulating evidence suggests that measuring loss of structural connectivity together with markers of core Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology such as amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles may facilitate identification of individuals with the greatest risk of progressing to dementia. The primary focus and overarching goal of this project is to improve prediction of cognitive decline in the preclinical stage, prior to irreversible disease stages by utilizing novel wavelets based multi-scale brain connectivity signatures (WaCS) and deriving mechanisms that characterize the propagation of plaque and tangle pathology in the brain over time. We will accomplish this goal by using longitudinal cognitive and diffusion weighted magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging data acquired from asymptomatic middle-aged participants enrolled in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention study and the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center clinical core. The analyses will be driven by (a) the “Wavelets on graphs” transforms which allow us to simultaneously operate on multiple scale representations of brain connectivity and yield very sensitive detection of weak but real disease-specific signals with rigorous statistical confidence and (b) novel algebraic formulations that parameterize the dynamics of molecular pathology progression at the subject-specific level using an exquisite spatial mapping of amyloid and tau pathology with PiB and MK6240 PET. The proposed project comprises of three aims. Specific Aim 1: Derive structural connectivity phenotypes of preclinical AD by extending wavelet based multi-scale representations of brain connectivity graphs with improved microstructural specificity offered by biophysical diffusion models beyond classical diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We will utilize  𝛽𝛽 these representations to identify statistical associations between connectivity, cerebrospinal fluid based AD biomarkers (e.g., A 42, phosphorylated tau), and cognitive trajectories. Specific Aim 2: Develop techniques to characterize the subject-specific propagation dynamics of amyloid and tau pathology as measured on PET images and evaluate their associations with structural connectivity, total pathology burden and cognitive scores. Specific Aim 3: Design frameworks for predicting cognitive trajectories at the individual level using structural connectivity and molecular pathology propagation networks. Significance: This project is expected to transform three distinct areas of AD research, it will (1) deliver the impact of multi-resolution analysis of brain connectivity networks derived from diffusion models beyond the classical DTI for preclinical AD, (2) characterize how amyloid plaque and tangle pathology propagate over time in a subject-specific manner in early AD stages and (3) how such information sources can be utilized to jointly predict endpoint diagnostic status at the level of individual subjects, for monitoring disease progression and as a first step towards criteria that could inform the design of secondary prevention trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This project will deploy novel algebraic methods for image analysis to characterize (i) changes in brain connectivity and (ii) dynamics of molecular pathology propagation in healthy asymptomatic individuals who are at risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and also have evidence of AD related pathology but are at a preclinical stage. The analysis will identify specific structural connections in the brain affected by highly specific tau and amyloid AD pathology: this will yield accurate mathematical models which use connectivity and longitudinal propagation of pathology markers for predicting clinical outcome measures such as longitudinal cognitive decline in cognitively healthy individuals. The joint connectivity/pathology AD biomarkers have applications in understanding the early AD processes in cognitively healthy at-risk individuals that could eventually inform the design of clinical trials and hypotheses driven studies focused on preclinical AD.",Algebraic Formulations for Characterizing Structural Brain Connectivity Changes and Pathology Transmission Networks in Preclinical

"CSF, MRI, and PET biomarkers of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorder. Inflammatory changes in the brain are thought to represent key processes in the onset and progression of AD, but it remains unclear whether neuroinflammation confers neuroprotection, accelerated degeneration, or possibly both. Such an understanding in living humans is critical if we are to begin clinical trials using the array of FDA-approved immunomodulatory drugs in the future. We propose that complement- mediated neuroinflammation is protective in the early AD stages, while suppression of complement activities is accompanied by the development of greater cognitive deficits and faster cognitive decline. Our preliminary data from multiple cohorts support this hypothesis by showing 1) reduced levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) complement-related markers occur in the dementia stage but not mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of AD; 2) reduced CSF complement-related markers and elevated CSF interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels are associated with faster decline in AD; and 3) CSF inflammatory protein alterations reveal networks of cellular and protein regulations. In the In the current application, we will build on the association between complement related proteins and rates of cognitive decline in AD to identify associated changes in soluble CSF cytokines and chemokines, differential inflammatory cell type regulation, and imaging correlates of neuroinflammation. This application takes advantage of our group’s strengths in performing CSF cytokine measurements, CSF immunophenotyping, molecular imaging of neuroinflammation through positron emission tomography (PET) and iron-enhanced MRI, and network analysis through a novel biochemical-bioinformatics pipeline. We will directly identify individual and networks of soluble CSF cytokines that accompany the transition from the MCI to the dementia stage of AD, correlate the complement and other altered pathways with microglial activation through two modern PET tracers (11C-PBR28 and 18F-FEPPA), and measure changes in individual T helper cell (type 1, 2, 17) and non-T cell populations. This application represents the first attempt to correlate, at the individual level and at the group level, CSF and imaging measures of neuroinflammation. If successful, this application will advance the understanding of neuroinflammation in AD through parallel approaches, form the basis of a new biomarker panel (and algorithm) to diagnose AD through a combination of degenerative and inflammatory markers, and accelerate the target identification of future therapeutics aimed at modulating the immune system in AD. Brain inflammation is a key event in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease, but it is not clear whether it is harmful, protective, or both. The current proposal aims to confirm our finding that a switch from the protective to harmful type of inflammation predicts more severe symptoms and faster progression in Alzheimer’s disease, and we can identify people with the protective and harmful inflammation by studying the cerebrospinal fluid (circulating proteins and cells) and brain imaging (PET and MRI scans).","CSF, MRI, and PET biomarkers of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease",9976071,R01AG054046,"['immune modulators ', ' immune modulatory agents ', ' immune modulatory drugs ', ' immunomodulating agents ', ' immunomodulatory agents ', ' immunomodulatory drugs ', ' immunomodulatory therapeutics ', ' Immunomodulators ', ' molecule imaging ', ' molecular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' neuroinflammatory ', ' neuroinflammation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' demographics ', ' FDA approved ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' AD pathology ', "" Alzheimer's pathology "", "" Alzheimer's disease pathology "", ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' marker panel ', ' biomarker panel ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' Imaging ligands ', ' bio-informatics pipeline ', ' bioinformatics pipeline ', "" Alzheimer's diagnosis "", "" Alzheimer's disease diagnosis "", ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' antiinflammatory ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Blood -

"Cognitive Heterogeneity in those with high Alzheimer's Disease Risk The lack of an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has led to a call to detect the disease earlier in its course but AD's insidious onset that can span many years, adds complexity to doing so. As a result, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) has identified to understand the heterogeneity of AD, particularly at the asymptomatic stages as a research priority. While there are well-documented high AD risk factors (e.g., age, apolipoprotein E4, cardiovascular risk, amyloid and tau pathology), diagnosis is not inevitable, but it remains unknown why only some of those with high AD risk progress to disease and others do not. We contend that one challenge for answering this question is that by the time traditional AD preclinical symptoms of memory decline and/or hippocampal atrophy emerge, the neurodegenerative trajectory is already on a near irreversible course. We further hypothesize that traditional measurement methods produce crude measures that mask the broader range of clinical expression in the preclinical period and preclude the earliest opportunity to detect the beginning of the neurodegenerative trajectory. In this updated application, we seek to leverage the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) cognitive aging and dementia database, acquired through nearly 7 decades of prospective examination. Unique to FHS since 2005 has been the collection of novel NP indices (error responses, digital metrics such as item-level latencies, fragmented responses). Baseline data were collected at a time when the vast majority of these participants appeared asymptomatic, including those who are at high AD risk, a subset of which have since progressed to incident AD as well as similarly high AD risk subgroups who did not. Through a one year R56, we provide new preliminary data in support of our aims to 1) characterize the cognitive heterogeneity of these high AD risk groups as they do and do not progress to disease, 2) determine whether traditional neuroimaging biomarkers differentiate between progressors and non- progressors and 3) develop novel machine learning methods to identify neuroimaging indices even earlier than traditional MRI measures. We predict that with additional analyses we will identify unique cognitive profiles that better differentiate those at high AD risk who do and do not progress to AD, that the NP profiles of high AD risk progressors will be associated with AD neuroimaging markers (e.g. decline in total brain and hippocampal volume, increase in white matter hyperintensities) while the NP profiles of high AD risk non-progressors will not show similar evidence of brain structure changes. We will further build on our preliminary work of developing an adversarial learning framework to enhance baseline MRI images to serve as better predictors of high AD risk progressor and non-progressor groups than the original images. Results will lead to identification of a broader spectrum of preclinical presentation in those with high AD risk than has been previously recognized and thus better characterize the heterogeneity of NP performance, particularly earlier in the disease course, potentially identifying a critical period in which intervention strategies can mitigate disease risk. This study seeks to characterize the heterogeneity of cognitive profiles among those who are at high risk for Alzheimer's disease and differentiate those who do go on to disease and those who do not. This study is enhanced by novel cognitive data that include digital metrics, that permit more extensive characterization of unique cognitive profiles in these high-risk groups.",Cognitive

"Correction of Partial Volume Effects in PET for Alzheimer's Disease Using Unsupervised Deep Learning Correction of Partial Volume Effects in PET for Alzheimer's Disease Using Unsupervised Deep Learning Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by memory loss and cognitive impairments, affects approximately 5.8 million people in the United States. It is a burden for patients, families and the healthcare system. Post-mortem studies reveal that hyperphosphorylated Tau protein aggregates are closely related with AD. With the developments of selective Tau tracers, Tau distributions can now be characterized in vivo through Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. According to the Braak staging, Tau deposits start from the transentorhinal region of the temporal lobe at preclinical AD, then spreading to other cortex regions at late stages. Regional Tau distribution pattern captured through PET Tau imaging can thus provide important staging information, which is vital for early disease diagnosis, progression tracking and treatment monitoring. However, accurate quantification of thin cortex uptake is difficult due to partial volume effects (PVEs) in PET imaging. Besides, for the second- generation Tau tracer, 18F-MK-6240, apart from higher uptakes observed in neocortical and medial temporal brain regions for AD patients, nonspecific uptakes are also observed in areas such as the meninges. Given the thin nature of the cortical ribbon and its close proximity to the meninges, quantitative accuracy and detection precision of 18F-MK-6240 distributions are significantly impacted, which in turn precludes finer localization of early tau accumulation associated with preclinical and prodromal AD. This grant application proposes a novel partial volume correction (PVC) method through unsupervised deep learning for Tau imaging. This new framework does not need high-quality training labels and the network is specifically trained for each subject, with the training objective function formulated based on the Poisson distribution assumption of the sinogram data. To further boost the performance, the transfer learning and the kernel learning are integrated into this PVC framework. The three specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop a PET PVC framework based on unsupervised deep learning, (2) to validate the proposed PVC framework using phantom studies and (3) to apply the proposed PVC framework to 18F-MK-6240 imaging datasets. We expect that the integrated outcome of the specific aims will be an efficient, practical and robust PVC method that can better resolve the Tau distribution patterns for the early diagnosis of AD.

"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",9916801,R01LM012535,"['Aging ', ""

"Deep Learning Algorithms for FreeSurfer Abstract FreeSurfer is a tool for the analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that has proven to be a flexible and powerful technology for quantifying the effects of many conditions, including numerous neurological disorders, on human brain anatomy, connectivity, vasculature, chemical composition, physiology and function. In the past 20 years, these open source tools have been developed to accurately and automatically segment an array of brain structures and have become the core analysis infrastructure for the Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative (ADNI). In this project, we seek the resources to radically increase the speed, accuracy and flexibility of these tools, taking advantage of exciting new results in Deep Learning. This will enable us to more accurately quantify neuroanatomical changes that are critical to diagnosing, staging and assessing the efficacy of potential therapeutic interventions in diseases such as Alzheimer’s. This includes the generation of documentation, tutorials, unit tests, regression tests and system tests to harden the tools and make them usable by clinicians and neuroscientists, and finally the distribution and support of the data, manual labelings and tools to the more than 40,000 researchers that use FreeSurfer through our existing open source mechanism. In addition, we will analyze the entire Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative dataset and return it for public release, including a set of manually labeled data that can be used to optimize Deep Learning tools for Alzheimer’s Disease over the next decade. Relevance Successful completion of the proposed project will increase the usability and accuracy of our publicly available segmentation tools, and open up new possibilities, such as integrating them into the MRI scanner and rapidly detecting Alzheimer’s-related changes. These new capabilities well enable other studies to significantly increase their ability to detect AD and other disease effects in research settings as well as phase II and phase III clinical trials due to the radical increase in speed of the new tools, enabling them to be applied to a diverse set of MRI contrasts and much larger datasets, rapidly and accurately.

"The Neuropathologic Landscape of Alzheimer's Disease in Hispanic Decedents Abstract: Hispanics are the fastest growing population in the US and epidemiological data suggests they are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and have a higher occurrence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) when compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). AD is defined neuropathologically by the deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid plaques. In addition to these hallmarks, many AD patients have mixed neuropathologies, including Lewy bodies (LBs) and pathological indices of CVD. Studies, involving mainly NHWs, have shown associations of these neuropathologies with clinical, genetic, and demographic variables providing insights into disease mechanisms and prevention strategies. However, there is a relative dearth of neuropathology studies on Hispanics. It is imperative to have neuropathology studies with individuals having diverse characteristics as this maximizes variability allowing for better identification of disease risk factors for more precision in development of preventative measures. This study will examine the neuropathologic landscape (the presence, location, and density of NFTs, plaques, CVD and LBs) of Hispanics compared to NHWs and determine if this landscape is altered by clinical, genetic, and demographic variables. To achieve efficiencies in time and further measurement precision we will enhance and adapt innovative machine learning algorithms to narrow in on pathology location and provide more quantitative analyses. Based on previous findings our central hypothesis is that Hispanics will have different neuropathologic landscapes when compared to NHWs and these differences are influenced by underlying risk factors, especially cardiovascular risk factors. Our specific aims are to: 1) profile the presence, location, and semi-quantitative densities of NFTs, plaques, LBs, and pathological indices of CVD in the setting of AD in Hispanics compared to NHWs, 2) profile and determine if pathologic measures from Aim 1 are altered by clinical, genetic, and demographic variables (APOE status, Hispanic origin, age at death, clinical history of cerebrovascular events (i.e. stroke), hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, sex, and/or education) and 3) strengthen and adapt a deep learning pipeline for quantifying AD pathologies. We will capitalize on existing well-characterized resources within three Alzheimer’s disease centers at University of California- Davis, the University of California- San Diego, and Columbia that contain a diverse autopsy confirmed AD Hispanic and NHW cohort. Also, we will use machine learning resources at the University of California San Francisco. This proposal will be the first largescale initiative to delineate the neuropathology in over 100 Hispanics of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Dominican origins compare to over 200 NHWs and determine the impact of comorbid risk factors. Profiling neuropathologic landscapes and understanding underlying factors has potential to shed light on mechanistic differences in disease development leading to better diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies. Results will directly advance understanding of brain health (pathology) in an important and growing part of the elderly population that to date there is miniscule neuropathology information.

"Alzheimer's Gut Microbiome Project ABSTRACT – Overall Behavioral, emotional and cognitive disorders have been historically studied as diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). However, emerging data suggests a gut-brain connection in a variety of diseases that affect the brain. Our own data and others’ suggests a gut-brain connection in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is the leading cause of dementia. There are currently no therapies to prevent or slow AD progression, causing a huge socioeconomic burden and highlighting our incomplete knowledge. Given an emerging role for gut microbiome and hypotheses implicating viral and bacterial contributions to AD pathogenesis, defining the bidirectional biochemical communication between the brain and the gut will improve understanding of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. Indeed, it is crucial to study the brain not in isolation, but in the context of peripheral influences including diet, lifestyle, and microbiome. In this proposal we build on large initiatives and infrastructures co-established by our multi-disciplinary team including: The American Gut Project, The AD Metabolomics Consortium, Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs), National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD), The National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) and centers of excellence in informatics and systems biology. We aim to define the role of gut microbiome in AD pathogenesis and biochemical axis of communication between gut and brain. Aim 1: Examine the association between the gut microbiome and AD phenotypes. Aim 2: Define the biochemical axis of communication between the gut microbiome and the brain and identify metabolites that contribute to AD endophenotypes. Aim 3: Examine mechanistic links between the activity of the gut microbiome and AD pathogenesis, and identify new approaches for AD prevention that target the gut-brain axis. These aims will be enabled three projects supported by an Omics and Technology Core, a Computational and Systems Biology Core, and an Administrative Core that provides data and biorepository infrastructure. Project 1 will define changes in gut microbiome and metabolome across the AD trajectory; Project 2 leverages three existing clinical trials of controlled diets to examine dietary effects on gut microbiome, metabolome, cognition and brain imaging; Project 3 examines mechanism by defining gut- brain communication and microbiome-based interventions in animal models of AD. In this U19 we will create an unprecedented, high-quality dataset and resources specifically for the AD research community, and make these available under open science, FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data principles. With our cross-disciplinary team of experts in clinical AD, gut microbiome research, imaging, metabolomics, informatics, deep learning and systems biology, this effort will yield novel biomarkers for AD progression and prognosis, and insight into mechanisms opening the door to development of transformative options for AD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE – Overall Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurological disease in the US and evidence suggests that genetics, gut bacteria, diet, lifestyle, and environmental exposures contribute to human metabolism and its dysregulation in diseases including AD. Gut-brain biochemical axis are being identified and seem implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders like AD. Understanding how different diets can prevent or reverse AD, and targets that could be delivered microbioiologically or pharmacologically to persons who cannot or will not change their diet, is an important long-term goal in AD research, especially given the emerging understanding that responses to diet are highly individualized and dependent on the microbiome. The goal of the current project is to define the gut-brain-chemical axis of communication of the role of the gut microbiome in AD pathogenesis.",Alzheimer's Gut Microbiome

"UK-ADRC neuroimaging supplement: LATE and PART PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – OVERALL (Adapted from Abstract of parent grant, UK-ADC) This is a proposal for a University of Kentucky Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (UK-ADRC) neuroimaging supplement. This purpose of the supplement is to provide neuroimaging data on the UK-ADRC’s deeply phenotyped clinical cohort to the NIH’s recently funded initiative, Standardized Centralized Alzheimer's and Related Dementias Neuroimaging (SCAN). In addition, a secondary purpose of this supplement is to identify neuroimaging correlates of two AD-mimics: limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) and primary age-related tauopathy (PART). The UK-ADRC is an experienced and collaborative ADRC originally funded in 1985. Our principal mission is to serve as the focal point for all AD-related activities at UK and this region of the United States, by providing an environment and core resources that catalyze innovative research, outreach, education, and clinical programs. Our signature resources include: 1) a cognitively normal group of ~500 subjects followed longitudinally, with all committed to brain autopsy upon death; 2) a strong program in clinical-neuropathological correlations and short postmortem interval autopsies; 3) an established program studying preclinical biomarkers of AD using neuroimaging and biofluids; 4) an integrated centralized database and innovative biostatistical expertise to characterize clinical and biological transitions; and 5) a successful and close partnership with the African-American community and increased participation of underrepresented individuals in our longitudinal cohort and ADRC-affiliated research studies and clinical trials. The overall scientific emphasis of the UK-ADRC continues to be on our interrelated themes: Transitions & Translation. Our well-characterized, longitudinal cohort and historically strong neuropathology program focused on normal aging, preclinical disease states and early cognitive transitions have been central to our success in defining early pathogenic mechanisms underlying the transitions from normal cognitive aging to impairment. The depth of expertise and collaborative nature of our investigators have also resulted in substantial progress on translation of that knowledge into new targets and novel therapeutic strategies. The UK-ADRC provides an infrastructure and environment that focuses on these integrated themes and advances AD research, education, outreach, and clinical programs through highly interactive and effective components: Administrative Core, Clinical Core, Data Management and Statistics Core, Neuropathology Core, Outreach and Recruitment Core, Biomarker Core, and Research Education Component. The UK-ADRC will make resources from these Cores available to support the success of this ADRC neuroimaging supplement. NARRATIVE This supplement will fill a critical gap in the field by focusing on the development of neuroimaging biomarkers of two common AD mimics: LATE and PART. By imaging subjects who are A negative and without significant cerebrovascular disease, we will identify MRI patterns characteristic of these AD mimics. We will share the UK SCAN neuroimaging data, combined with our deep clinical, biofluid, and genetic phenotyping of these longitudinally followed subjects, to stimulate additional research on AD mimics

"THE NIA GENETICS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE DATA STORAGE SITE Abstract/Summary NIA Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) is a one-stop access portal for Alzheimer's disease genetics and serves as the data coordinating center for the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). ADSP has expanded substantially since NIAGADS submitted the renewal application in 2016, including processing sequence data of up to 114,335 genomes from 119 cohorts (10 times what was anticipated initially) and three new major initiatives on machine learning analysis, phenotype harmonization, and functional genomics. Neither NIA nor NIAGADS could have anticipated the major growth or the new NIA initiatives when the original application was written, and it is imperative that we augment the capacity of NIAGADS to maintain efficient operations with this supplement request. The proposed administrative supplement aims to augment the capacity of NIAGADS and maintain efficient operations for ADSP support in order that NIA meets its NAPA Milestones. The request is within the scope of the original research plan and includes four tasks: (1) additional programmer support to maintain NIAGADS cloud data sharing service and its security; (2) develop tools for cloud- based data analysis; (3) collaborate with Case Western Reserve University to enhance our cloud-based computing infrastructure for ADSP data analysis; (4) expand NIAGADS outreach with a website for disseminating AD genetics research to a wider audience.

Currently, 5.7 million US citizens are living with the effects of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), which is estimated to rise to 14 million by 2025. A National Plan has been implemented by the US aimed at preventing and effectively treating AD and related dementias by 2025. To support precision medicine based on genomic data, UniProt is tasked with providing a centralized resource that both links the genome to the functional proteins it encodes. It also efficiently identifies, captures and disseminates published information on protein function, facilitating computational analysis. The goal of this supplement is to further enhance the usability and content of the AD pages in the prototypic Disease Portal, in response to feedback obtained at a series of NIA-funded AD workshops. We will enable users access to protein pages for genes associated with the disease that have been identified by several groups active in the field, and make these easily discoverable by use of additional disease ontologies. We will provide graphical views of protein expression data and links to data on orthologous genes/proteins in model organism species.

"Multiband ASL for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia with enormous healthcare burden. Identification of preclinical disease is critical for the development of therapy, as significant neuronal death has already occurred by the time of symptom onset. Arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is an appealing approach for measuring perfusion in dementia by utilizing magnetically labeled arterial blood water as an endogenous tracer. We and others have applied ASL to study AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Characteristic patterns of cerebral hypoperfusion in temporoparietal association cortices, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus and frontal cortex were detected using ASL in AD patients, and to a lesser extent, in MCI populations. However, there remain several challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying AD and other neurodegenerative disorders, including: 1) Existing ASL techniques generally have a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, making it difficult to decompose structural and functional components of neurodegenerative effects due to partial volume effects; 2) The recommended implementation of pseudo- continuous ASL (pCASL) with segmented 3D acquisition is susceptible to (inter-segment) head motion that is frequently present in aged populations; and 3) The relatively long duration of segmented 3D acquisition generally allows a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan, which is susceptible to age dependent variations in arterial transit time, affecting the accuracy of perfusion quantification. The goal of the parent R01 project (EB028297 “Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study”) was to develop and evaluate cutting-edge multiband (MB) pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi- delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. During this project, we will apply cutting edge high-resolution 2D and 3D MB pCASL techniques and deep-learning (DL) denoising algorithms in 3 groups of mild AD, amnestic MCI and age matched control subjects, and compare the results with those by standard pCASL methods. We hypothesize that the developed MB pCASL protocols and DL algorithms are more sensitive than standard pCASL techniques for detecting perfusion differences between mild AD, MCI and control subjects. The successful completion of this project will lead to robust high resolution multi-delay MB pCASL protocols with associated DL denoising algorithms which may serve as biomarkers for AD and MCI. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia with enormous healthcare burden. This project will evaluate cutting edge high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to noninvasively detect cerebral blood flow reductions in elderly humans with mild AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

"Forecasting response to pharmacological interventions in Alzheimer's and related dementias based on medical record and brain MRI characteristics: A precision medicine approach Summary: Toward our long-term goal of developing a methodological framework for predicting response to pharmacological treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias in clinical settings, we propose a proof of concept study to investigate clinical and neuroanatomical features related to response to treatment with two classes of medications that are currently in wide use: cholinesterase inhibitors (CEI) and serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). These treatments are focused on alleviating symptoms and extending patient autonomy. CEIs have shown efficacy in improving activities of daily living and are more cost- effective than supportive care. SSRIs are a first choice for the pharmacological treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) that affect ~97% of AD patients. However, response to CEI/SSRI varies between patients, with only half responding to these drugs. Moreover, one-third of patients discontinue therapy because of adverse effects. Given the AD pandemic, with 16M patients expected in the US by 2050, the targeted use of CEI/SSRI to patients who will benefit from treatment is a public health priority. Although predictive markers to identify those who will respond to CEI/SSRI have been highly anticipated, there, as yet, no established such markers. Several clinical or genetic markers have been proposed as response predictors, but none have been validated. Studying neuroanatomical features of the brain, which can be detected through MRI (= brain phenotype), has succeeded in the identification of subgroups of AD related to clinical, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric characteristics. However, little is known about whether brain phenotyping predicts response to pharmacological interventions. Available results from pilot studies with small and highly selected samples point to the necessity of studying larger, more inclusive cohorts. Since individualized prediction cannot be made from a single feature, as each feature weakly correlates with outcomes, we hypothesize that patient stratification that combines brain phenotype and clinical characteristics, will be highly accurate at individualized prediction. In this study, we will utilize pre-existing resources to identify brain phenotypes and clinical features that might predict response to CEI/SSRI treatment. First, data extracted from a large pool of electronic medical records acquired through clinical practice will be used to identify brain phenotypes and clinical features related to a response to CEI/SSRI. Second, our automated brain features extraction pipeline, which is robust to the great heterogeneity in diseased brains will be used to quantify brain phenotypes. We propose Aim 1 to assess the feasibility of brain phenotyping and Aim 2 to assess the feasibility of a supervised clustering approach based on brain phenotype and clinical features, in predicting a response to CEI/SSRI. The proposed feasibility testing based on analysis of data from a real world clinical care patient cohort will lay the foundation for future studies and provides a framework to identify subgroups of AD who will benefit from specific medications, including those that become available in the future, for safe and effective treatment. Narrative Toward our long-term goal of developing a methodological framework for predicting response to pharmacological treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias in clinical settings, we propose a proof of concept study to investigate clinical and neuroanatomical features related to response to treatment with two classes of medications that are currently in wide use: cholinesterase inhibitors (CEI) and serotonin specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). We will combine a large number of medical records acquired through clinical practice with our cutting-edge high-throughput brain imaging analysis methods to identify subgroups of AD with similar brain and clinical phenotypes who will have better responses to CEI or SSRI treatment. The proposed feasibility testing based on retrospective data analysis provides a framework to identify subgroups of AD patients who may benefit from medications, including those that may become available in the future.",Forecasting response to pharmacological interventions in Alzheimer's and related dementias based on medical record and brain MRI characteristics: A precision medicine

"Statistical Models of Alzheimer's Disease Pathological Cascade Abstract Enormous effort has been made to uncover the series of changes in biomarkers along Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiological pathway and its later clinical manifestations. The most influential hypothetical model proposed by Jack and colleagues has greatly shaped AD research in the past decade, whereas it remains a hypothesis to be validated. The key challenge in the validation is the fact that AD pathophysiological process is not directly observable. The temporal biomarker profile is therefore usually examined against discrete clinical diagnoses, estimated years from clinical symptom onset or test score of cognitive impairment – neither is a good measure of the AD pathogenic process, but merely clinical consequences that have been shown to vary greatly among individuals and also to be affected by other diseases. In this proposal, we will tackle this topic in the following aspects. (1) We will develop appropriate statistical models that directly address the unobservable nature of the AD pathophysiological process and therefore provide the foundation to operationalize and validate hypothetical AD biomarker models. (2) We will utilize data across multiple AD database to provide data-based evidence on the AD biomarker cascade and its clinical manifestations, as well as inform the link between the newly proposed biological AD definition in the 2018 NIA-AA research guideline and the current syndromic AD definition. (3) We will develop a statistical framework for dynamic prediction of AD pathophysiological progression trajectory and its clinical manifestations based on the history of a patient’s biomarker profiles. (4) We will develop a web-based application that allows for expedited delivery of statistical learning into practice. Although the scientific questions are focused, the proposed statistical model is applicable to many observational studies with longitudinal, multivariate biomarker measures to capture an unobservable structure, such as in aging or mental health studies. Narrative The project develops appropriate statistical methodologies to evaluate temporal biomarker changes along a pathophysiological process that cannot be directly observed, bridge the gap between a rigorous evaluation and the practical constraints using existing data sources, and attempt to provide individualized prediction of a patient’s future progression trajectory and associated clinical manifestations based on the biomarker history of this patient. Methods are motivated by the need to understand the series of changes in biomarkers along the Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiological pathway during the asymptotic stage and its later clinical manifestations, but can be applied to many biomarker studies where the outcome is not directly observable, such as in aging or mental health studies.",Statistical Models of Alzheimer's Disease Pathological Cascade,10026353,R01AG068002,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Influentials ', ' Joints ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Process Measure ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Sigmoid ', ' Sigmoid colon ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Shapes ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' user-friendly ', ' AD model ', ' alzheimer model ', "" Alzheimer's disease model "", ' therapeutic agent development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' evidence base ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' AD pathology ', "" Alzheimer's pathology "", "" Alzheimer's disease pathology "", ' Formulation ', ' patient biomarkers ', ' semiparametric ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' personalized predictions ', "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', ' Alzheimer’s biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', ' statistical learning ', ' Visualization ', ' multiple data sources ', ' ']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,409375,0.3020957481079518
"Center for Identification and Study of Individuals with Atypical Diabetes Mellitus (U54) Diabetes is traditionally classified in two broad categories: autoimmune Type 1 and obesity-related Type 2. Numerous phenotypically and etiologically distinct forms exist and are emerging, collectively termed “atypical diabetes” (AD), that do not fit into either category. We hypothesize that AD comprises a spectrum that includes numerous forms, both known (e.g, MODY/monogenic, Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults, Ketosis-Prone Diabetes) and unknown. We propose to establish the Center for Atypical Diabetes Research and Evaluation (CADRE). The goals of CADRE are to (1) identify and define comprehensively the forms of AD; and (2) establish an extensive database and repository of biosamples from AD patients. Defining the forms of AD is challenging because the etiology of AD can range from a single gene variant to a highly complex mixture of genetics, epigenetics and environmental factors. To identify patients with AD, and then to define the forms, we will use a two-pronged approach. Approach (a) will use clustering analysis of genotypic and phenotypic data from diverse groups of patients with diabetes. We have recruited 15 domestic and international population cohorts with data on more than 33,000 patients with diabetes. Further, we have recruited six diabetes study clinics (Baylor College of Medicine [BCM], University of Washington [UW], Indiana University [IU], Emory University, University of Colorado, and SUNY Downstate) who will prospectively recruit patients. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation will facilitate recruitment from patient groups. The Administrative Core at BCM will work with cohorts and clinics to obtain data. The University of South Florida (USF) will filter data for AD and separate patients into phenotypically homogenous clusters that can be diagnosed based on genetic and clinical features unique to the cluster. Approach (b) will identify monogenic, oligogenic and mitochondrial forms of AD from patients enrolled in genetics registries (BCM) and a family study with genetic data (Botnia). The BCM registries include patients referred to the Undiagnosed Disease Network. All patients will undergo whole-exome and mitochondrial genome sequencing (Cores at BCM), single-nucleotide polymorphism variant analysis (Oxford), metabolomic analysis (Duke) and phenotypic analysis of C-peptide, adiponectin, proinsulin, islet autoantibodies, and serum insulin DNA levels (Cores at UW and IU). To establish the database and biorepository, we will invite patients with AD to participate in sample donation and longitudinal follow-up via the cohorts and clinics. Data and samples will be transferred to the Database and Biorepository Core at USF, with input and tracking implemented using the successful framework developed by USF for large multicenter trials. Data will be made available through the NIDDK and a CADRE website and samples will be made available through ancillary study application. Ongoing patient recruitment to expand the database and biorepository will occur through the study clinics and clinician referral through the CADRE website. Overall, CADRE will be built on a foundation of existing, successful core facilities and computational systems to create a lasting resource that will substantially advance AD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE For many people with diabetes, their symptoms do not match those usually associated with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We will use medical and genetic information from a large number of patients with diabetes to find all the forms of “atypical diabetes,” so doctors can better diagnose and treat these patients. We will also make the Center for Atypical Diabetes Research and Evaluation (CADRE) to keep data and samples from patients with atypical diabetes, so scientists can study these forms of

"Quantifying the individual contributions of comorbid tau neuropathologies using deep learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Co-occurrence of different neurodegenerative diseases is increasingly common with age and acts as a confounding factor in the development of disease-specific biomarkers. Yet, even by the gold standard of evaluating immunostaining for aggregated proteins in autopsy brains, pathologic complexity makes it impossible to reliably quantify the mixture of diseases by visual inspection, especially when coexistent disorders both feature the same aggregated protein, albeit in different disease-specific patterns. Here, we hypothesize that recent advances in deep learning can identify the distinctive patterns of Alzheimer disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) neuropathology, thereby allowing us to de-convolve their individual contributions from phospho-tau immunostaining of mixed pathologies. We will tackle this problem in three steps. First, in order to incorporate biological knowledge and enable interpretability of our disease predictions, we will develop a set of deep learning classifiers to identify disease relevant “features” in virtual whole slide images. These features will include different types of cells (e.g. neurons, astrocytes), aggregates (e.g. tufted astrocytes and senile plaques that are enriched in PSP and AD, respectively) and tissue regions (gray vs. white matter, which differ in pattern of involvement in these diseases). Second, based on the assumption that comorbid pathologies exhibit a mixture of pure disease features, we will build disease classifiers from pure AD and pure PSP cases. Given a local patch of tau-stained tissue, these classifiers will return their confidence that tissue exhibited either of these diseases. We will evaluate two approaches, one building on the “features” identified above and the other a more traditional black- box deep learning approach working purely off of image patches. Finally, we will evaluate our pure disease classifiers on cases with mixed pathologies based on pathologist review and concordance with antibodies to tau isoforms whose individual histomorphologies help to distinguish between AD and PSP. As they will identify established neuropathology features demonstrated by the widely-used AT8 phospho-tau and 3R and 4R tau isoform immunostaining, our classifiers will be a valuable resource for future digital imaging based studies in neuropathology. Our framework for de-convolving comorbidities from autopsy samples can be extended to other diseases, thus enabling better integration with clinical and biomarker data, and ultimately, improved antemortem diagnosis and therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Co-occurrence of different neurodegenerative pathologies is increasingly common with age. Here, we aim to use deep learning to distinguish the relative contributions of individual comorbid diseases from tau-stained images of autopsy brains affected by two comorbid conditions, Alzheimer disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. Technologies developed during this proposal will provide powerful machine learning tools for neuropathology, while its successful completion will facilitate better integration with clinical and biomarker data, and ultimately, improved antemortem diagnosis and therapy.",Quantifying the individual contributions of comorbid tau neuropathologies using deep learning,10058010,R21AG066012,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Antibodies ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' mAbs ', ' Astrocytes ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Astroglia ', ' astrocytic glia ', ' Atlases ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Libraries ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Stains ', ' Staining method ', ' Progressive Supranuclear Palsy ', ' Progressive Supranuclear Ophthalmoplegia ', ' Steele-Richardson-Olszewski Disease ', ' Steele-Richardson-Olszewski Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' tau Proteins ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' tau ', ' tau factor ', ' τ Proteins ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Biological ', ' Lesion ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' p-tau ', ' p-τ ', ' phospho-tau ', ' phospho-τ ', ' phosphorylated tau ', ' tau-1 ', ' Tissue Stains ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Amyloid Plaques ', ' Neuritic Plaques ', ' amyloid beta plaque ', ' amyloid-b plaque ', ' aβ plaques ', ' cored plaque ', ' diffuse plaque ', ' Senile Plaques ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Histopathology ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Sampling ', ' neuropathology ', ' tau associated neurodegeneration ', ' tau associated neurodegenerative process ', ' tau induced neurodegeneration ', ' tau mediated neurodegeneration ', ' tau neurodegenerative disease ', ' tau neuropathology ', ' tauopathic neurodegenerative disorder ', ' tauopathy ', ' Tauopathies ', ' Data ', ' virtual imaging ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' virtual ', ' protein aggregate ', ' insoluble aggregate ', ' protein aggregation ', ' case-based ', ' neocortical ', ' tumor ', ' applied learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' interactive learning ', ' hands-on learning ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' whole slide imaging ', ' deep learning ', ' Visualization ', ' learning classifier ', ' ']",NIA,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2020,450250,0.14833061667060332
"Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Karen Schliep, a tenure-line Assistant Professor of Public Health at the University of Utah. Dr. Schliep is establishing herself as a young investigator in women’s life-course epidemiology, specifically in a novel area of aging research—to improve our understanding of women’s increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (RD) and create women-specific interventions to mitigate risk and improve outcomes. This award will allow Dr. Schliep to achieve her goal of research independence by providing her support to accomplish the following training aims: 1) develop expertise in biomedical informatics and population-based research methods; 2) gain experience in the conduction of clinical cognitive health assessments; 3) enhance knowledge of modifiable factors affecting women’s mid- and late-life cognitive health; and 4) expand skills to independently lead and manage a successful research program. Dr. Schliep has assembled a mentoring team comprising a primary mentor, Dr. Michael Varner, an obstetrician and nationally renowned maternal-fetal medicine investigator with expertise in pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and two co-mentors: Dr. Norman Foster, a cognitive neurologist and geriatric neurologist and recognized leader in dementia research, and Dr. Ken Smith, an internationally known expert in population-based analyses and genetic/family epidemiology. Dr. Schliep has five advisors with expertise in classification modeling, ADRD neuropsychology, mid-life women’s health, longitudinal and survival data analysis, and chronic disease epidemiology.  Little is known regarding the association between HDP, estimated to complicate 2–8% of all pregnancies, and long-term adverse maternal neurological outcomes with similar inflammatory vascular etiologies, including ADRD. An estimated 5.4 million Americans currently suffer from ADRD, two-thirds of whom are women. As the US aging population increases, prevalence of dementia is expected to approach 13.2 to 16.0 million cases by 2050. Why ADRD disproportionately affects women is not known. Dr. Schliep’s research objective is to develop classification models for the various dementia subtypes (including AD, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia) to analyze longitudinal, individual-level data to better understand how HDP may increase a woman’s risk for ADRD. Dr. Schliep will accomplish this through the following research aims: 1) increase accuracy of ADRD diagnoses within health administrative databases; and 2) investigate the association between HDP and ADRD, and mid-life mediating factors. The proposal’s expected outcomes include 1) a novel method to accurately capture dementia cases within large linked health administrative databases; 2) clarity on how HDP may be linked with specific dementia subtypes; and 3) skills, experience, and preliminary data for Dr. Schliep to support future studies identifying other sex-specific risk factors for dementia and mediating factors amenable to interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women have a two-fold higher lifetime risk for Alzheimer Disease (AD), vascular dementia, and related dementias (RD) compared to men. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension, may contribute to sex differences in ADRD, with midlife experiences such as depression influencing the magnitude of risk. We propose to 1) create a model that can identify AD and related dementias in a large health administrative database; and 2) test the link (and mediating factors) between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and ADRD, which will serve as the first step towards creating women’s tailored intervention that can mitigate ADRD risk for women.","Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk

"Plasma Cell-Free RNA as Non-invasive Biomarker for Neurodegeneration Project Summary / Abstract Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Pathological changes in the brain can be observed at least 15 years before clinical symptoms (preclinical stage). An early and accurate diagnosis tool could save $7.9 trillion in medical and care costs. Moreover, an effective therapeutic strategy could improve the clinical outcome if delivered early. There is a clear need to develop cost-effective and non-invasive biomarkers for AD that can be used to identify individuals before symptoms emerge and patients at early-symptomatic stages of disease. These novel biomarkers could be also leveraged to monitor disease progression and responses to therapies. Cell-free nucleic acids diagnostic tests have revolutionized prenatal screening, and cancer research, diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, specific transcripts ascertained from cell-free RNA have been evaluated as biomarkers for AD, but so far, no high throughput approach has been attempted. The goal of this proposal is to use high throughput sequencing of cell-free nucleic acids from plasma to construct a prediction model for neurodegenerative diseases. I hypothesize that there are detectable changes in plasma cell-free nucleic acids that are related to AD. During the K99 phase, I aim to predict accurately AD cases using cell-free nucleic acid and bioinformatics tools, including machine learning. Briefly, I will sequence cell-free RNA present in longitudinal samples of plasma from AD cases and controls, then build a predictive model. I will replicate this model in an independent dataset of preclinical samples. I will include samples from mutation carriers and non-European ancestry to validate the model. I will also determine if the model can predict other neurodegenerative diseases or if it is specific to AD by quantifying plasma transcripts from patients with other neurodegenerative diseases. My preliminary data show that this approach is feasible. I designed a preliminary predictive model with 10 AD cases and 10 controls that has an area under the ROC curve of 1; then I replicated it in independent samples (n=20) with an area under the ROC curve of 0.84. In four preclinical samples the ROC was 0.86 suggesting that my model can also identify pre-symptomatic individuals. It is possible to improve this model by using more powerful informatics approaches. Using deep neural networks, I obtained a ROC of 1 in the discovery dataset and 0.94 in the replication dataset. During the R00 phase, I plan to use the same approach on other neurodegenerative diseases to design specific predictive models. I will generate sequence data on the RNA present in longitudinal plasma samples of cases and controls from Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies to construct specific predictive models for each of them. Then I will replicate the models in preclinical samples of these diseases. Combining the information on all neurodegenerative diseases will also allow me to refine the predictive model and perform integrative analyses to describe mechanistic insights. My ultimate goal is to be able to use the predictive models as diagnostic tools, and if possible, as early diagnostic tests. The preliminary data is encouraging and opens the possibility of having plasma-based tests for neurodegeneration. Project Narrative This proposal will use transcriptomic data from plasma to model a predictive tool for Alzheimer Disease using bioinformatics and machine learning approaches. This is an innovative approach, a cost-effective and minimally invasive biomarker for Alzheimer Disease, which is critical for early detection (preclinical), diagnosis, disease intervention and monitoring. If successful, the results will lead to a breakthrough in the field.",Plasma Cell-Free RNA as Non-invasive Biomarker for Neurodegeneration,9891490,K99AG062723,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia

"Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer Disease Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias that are associated with major adverse effects on daily function and quality of life, and accelerate time to institutionalization. Of all the NPS, depression is the most frequently observed symptom in people with mild cognitive impairment and early AD. As the disease progresses, agitation, delusions and hallucinations become more common, whereas apathy is the most persistent and frequent NPS throughout all the stages of AD. AD- NPS share some clinical features with serious mental illnesses (SMIs), such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, but whether these conditions share similar aethiopathies is unclear. Given that reliable treatments for NPS in the context of AD and other dementias do not exist, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying NPS in AD and other neuropsychiatric illnesses is a critical next step to identify reliable biomarkers that could lead to novel therapeutics.  There are two overarching goals of this proposal. First, we will identify the molecular mechanisms and neuropathological changes that are associated with the presence of NPS in patients with AD. Second, we will examine if the mechanisms of pathology associated with NPS are shared or distinct among AD and SMIs. More specifically, we propose to build multi-scale integrative models using phenomics and genomics data from 1,264 autopsy cases derived from a single brain bank. The bank includes detailed phenomics data such as well characterized NPS, clinical diagnosis (AD and other neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric traits), severity of cognitive decline and neuropathology for each patient sample. From each case, we will apply innovative approaches that reduce the cost and technical biases associated with conventional methods, and capture gene expression signatures and epigenetic regulatory elements at the single-cell level. Novel deep-learning methods will be applied for the multi-scale integration of neuropathologic changes with genetic markers and functional genomic changes (such as changes in gene expression and enhancer sequences) within specific cell types, to predict various NPS in AD and other neuropsychiatric traits; we refer to these integrative models as genotype- marker-phenotype models. We expect that these models will enable us to assign genotypes and molecular markers to specific NPS within AD and other neuropsychiatric traits at the single-cell level, an unprecedented level of resolution. In addition, we will test the translational potential of the genotype-marker-phenotype models to predict AD-NPS using independent large-scale biobank datasets, in which genotypes and electronic health records are available. Successful completion of the proposed studies will have immediate utility by generating potential biomarkers for NPS diagnosis and prognosis and by providing predictive models for patient stratification in clinical trials. In the longer term, our models will help us create a blueprint for therapeutic strategies and interventions to treat NPS in AD. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, that contributes to early institutionalization and causes substantial caregiving and caregiver burden. Despite decades of research, reliable treatments for NPS in the context of AD and other dementias have not been found. The proposed studies will generate and integrate high- dimensional phenomics and genomics data in human brain tissue, that will inform us about the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying NPS in the context of AD and other neuropsychiatric illnesses.",Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer Disease,10150353,R01AG067025,"['Aerosols ', ' Air ', ' Air Pressure ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Bacteria ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Delusions ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Genetic Enhancer Element ', ' Enhancer Elements ', ' enhancer sequence ', ' genetic enhancer sequence ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' environmental contamination ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Hallucinations ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Mycoplasma ', ' Eperythrozoon ', ' Haemobartonella ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Production ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Restlessness ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' instrument ', ' Hour ', ' Severities ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' brain tissue ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Nuclear ', ' trait ', ' sterile ', ' Sterility ', ' novel ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting -

"US-South American Initiative for Genetic-Neural-Behavioral Interactions in Human Neurodegenerative Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although dementia has a global impact, efforts to address ensuing challenges have come mostly from high- income countries (HICs). Whereas the prevalence and incidence of dementia appear to be stable or declining in such countries, an alarmingly opposite tendency typifies South American countries (SAC). This scenario proves even more challenging due to region-specific traits. First, the particular genetic and environmental backgrounds of SAC limit the generalizability of key findings from HICs. Moreover, the greater genetic diversity and impact of socioeconomic status (SES) of SAC remain markedly understudied. Of note, this is true of the four largest SAC (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Peru), representing over 75% of the region’s population. In addition, SAC face a dearth of innovative, harmonized, and cross-regional studies on two of their most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It is thus critical for SAC to join ongoing international efforts and develop a gold-standard approach for detecting disease-specific alterations in a context of methodological, genetic, and socioeconomic heterogeneity. Against this background, our long-term goal is to identify the unique genetic and SES factors that drive AD and FTD presentation in SAC relative to the US. To this end, we will establish a cohort to test large samples from the four abovementioned SAC, as well as the US (totaling > 3000 participants, including 1500 controls, 750 AD patients, and 750 FTD patients). We will combine standardized clinical assessments with innovative analytical techniques including multimodal machine learning to account for heterogeneity in these diverse populations. By combining standardized genetic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (SES-cognitive) measures, we will test the underlying hypothesis that there are unique risk factors for AD and FTD in SAC which do not prove significant in US populations. More particularly, we will aim to (a) establish genetic risk to AD and FTD in diverse SAC cohorts; (b) test whether patients from SAC and the US can be discriminated after accounting for how SES affects cognitive and brain imaging signatures; and (c) determine genetic, cognitive, cerebral, and socioeconomic factors that discriminate among SAC vs. US patients. Positive impacts of this work include a better understanding of the genetic and socioeconomic factors driving neurocognitive manifestations of dementia, and the identification of novel genetic targets for risk reduction and disease prevention in SAC. Our large multimodal, cross-sectional study will enable clinical assessment of understudied patient groups, extend and harmonize existing data sets, and prompt the development of novel measures and multimodal machine learning protocols. More generally, by establishing a collaborative framework which capitalizes on unique regional populations, our proposal can consolidate a SAC-based platform for future translational research and assessment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although the prevalence and incidence of dementia appears to be stable or declining in high-income countries, South American countries (SAC) face the opposite scenario, with increased dementia prevalence, probably triggered by a combination of genetic and socioeconomic status (SES) factors. This proposal aims to create the first SAC-based multicenter initiative to study dementia, by combining genomic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (cognitive, clinical, socioeconomic) data. This project constitutes an unprecedented opportunity to foster regional synergy and multilevel research towards the harmonization of global strategies to fight dementia in SAC.",US-South American

"A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs ABSTRACT. This Supplement extends Aims 1 and 2 of the parent grant on Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) by developing: prospective benchmarks for algorithms that predict biomarkers of disease risk (Aim 1) and new algorithms to support drug repositioning (Aim 2). Both extensions strengthen Aims 1 and 2 for AD but also have immediate applications for research on COVID-19 disease in keeping with NOT-AG-20-022. AIM 1 of the parent grant develops EA-ML, a Machine Learning (ML) pipeline to compare coding mutations in individuals with and without AD. The output is a list of genes with which to predict AD risk from their mutations. While the parent grant has multiple criteria for success, none are prospective given the vast lead-time between AD onset and symptoms. Supplemental Aim 1 adds prospective testing, using COVID-19. This is possible because the UK Biobank has begun to annotate its 50,000 public exomes with the COVID-19 status of individuals, including who had severe morbidity or mild symptoms at worst. The biobank will also add 150,000 more exomes by end 2020. Accordingly, we will apply EA-ML to the current UK biobank data to identify human genetic biomarkers that distinguish severe from mild cases and then test EA-ML predictions of COVID-19 virulence prospectively, on the exomes that are newly added to the biobank. As a further new benchmark, we will also compare EA-ML to a novel “EA-Wavelet” algorithm, also tested prospectively on COVID-19. EA- Wavelet sorts cases from controls by factoring EA over the entire network of human protein-protein interactions. The results will tell us which of EA-ML, EA-Wavelet, or combination thereof is the best at identifying critical biomarkers and clinical risk of AD, while also doing the same for COVID-19. Aim 2 of the parent grant develops drug repositioning for AD by linking target genes and drugs via knowledge maps of functional interactions. Here, we propose a complementary approach that connect genes to drugs via structural maps of binding epitopes. For this we will comprehensively map evolutionarily important sites in the structural proteome of genes that are associated with AD. The approach exploits EA theory to measure past and present evolutionary forces in fitness landscapes, and it takes into account current sequence variations to guard against any possible mutational escape from drugs that target these epitopes. The output will be surface accessible regions of proteins that can then be used for (i) computational docking of small molecules towards drug repurposing, combination therapy, and lead discovery for drug design3-5; (ii) engineering mimetic peptides or other molecules that can inhibit normal interactions6; and (iii) CRISPR engineering or peptide synthesis that create antigens for more effective vaccines7, 8. These automated mapping tools are general, and besides in SARS-CoV-2, will identify an entire new structural library of functional sites to target for AD therapy with repurposed drugs. This Supplement will extend the computational Aims 1 and 2 of the parent grant on Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Supplemental Aim 1 will provide, by way of COVID-19, the first ever rigorous tests that benchmark our new algorithms prospectively, so that we can use them in AD to identify predictive biomarkers and clinical risk of developing disease with a better understanding of their strengths and limitations, and Supplemental Aim 2 will develop a new approach to link disease driver genes to drugs based on the identification of structural epitopes that can then serve as binding targets for drug repositioning or vaccine development. Both supplemental aims make use of COVID-19 data to develop and test these capabilities which will then be put to immediate use in AD, serving the dual mission of improving disease surveillance and therapy in both COVID-19 and AD.",A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs,10198233,R01AG061105,"['Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Calculi ', ' Catalysis ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combined treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Engineering ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Viral Genes ', ' Genetic Code ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Immunotherapy ', ' Immune mediated therapy ', ' Immunologically Directed Therapy ', ' immune therapeutic approach ', ' immune therapeutic interventions ', ' immune therapeutic regimens ', ' immune therapeutic strategy ', ' immune therapy ', ' immune-based therapies ', ' immune-based treatments ', ' immuno therapy ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Peptides ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Solvents ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Virulence ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' disease onset ', ' disorder onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' success ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' vaccine formulation ', ' vaccine development ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Proteome ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' theories ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' case control ', ' mimetics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' small molecule ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Symptoms ', ' protein structures ', ' proteins structure ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Protein Region ', ' Peptide Synthesis ', ' Update ', ' Docking ', ' protein function ', ' Output ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' prospective ', ' peptide mimetic ', ' peptide mimic ', ' peptidomimetics ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' prototype ', ' parent grant ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' clinical risk ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive marker ', ' Patient risk ', ' support tools ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' prospective test ', ' Disease Surveillance ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' 2019 novel coronavirus ', ' SARS-CoV-2 ', ' SARS-CoV2 ', ' SARS-associated coronavirus 2 ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 ', ' SARS-related coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' Wuhan coronavirus ', ' 2019-nCoV ', "" Alzheimer's therapy "", "" Alzheimer's disease therapy "", ' graph knowledge base ', ' graph knowledgebase ', ' knowledge graph ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' ']",NIA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,386555,0.3282920232564135
"Development of a Caregiver Application and AI-Enabled Intelligent Assistant to Support Families and Formal Care Providers in Caring for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias PROJECT ABSTRACT Family caregivers face daunting challenges in caring for persons with Alzheimer’s disease. Currently, there is no widely available mechanism to provide real-time, context sensitive support to informal AD caregivers that can address the specific care needs of each AD patient. To address this critical gap, we developed CareVirtue, an innovative web/mobile application for family caregivers that also assists formal care providers helping these families. During this Phase I project we will validate the CareVirtue web/mobile application as a method for caregivers to document daily care interactions with AD patients, and establish the utility of the generated data to develop predictive models for an intelligent caregiver assistant application. Looking ahead, our long term goal is to commercialize an AI-enabled intelligent caregiver assistant application that provides on demand, highly-relevant information about AD patients to care teams, which will ameliorate caregiver stress & burden, reduce health care expenditures, and improve quality of care for both AD patients and their caregivers.

"Circadian Organization and Disorder in Alzheimer's Disease ABSTRACT With an aging population, the impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD) on public health continues to explode. Altered daily rhythms in physiology and behavior are prominent features of AD. These altered activity rhythms are difficult to treat, disrupting the lives of both patients and caregivers. Mounting evidence suggests that these changes are more than just symptoms. Altered rhythms may contribute to AD progression and development. Many important transcripts, proteins, and metabolites oscillate with a daily cycle. Understanding these rhythms, and their influence on AD, offers the potential to identify new therapies. The translation of circadian biology to Alzheimer's care is limited. Which molecules and pathways show daily rhythms in our human brains? How do those rhythms change with AD? Do changes in molecular rhythms explain changing behavioral patterns? Can these rhythms be exploited for therapeutic benefit? To answer clinical questions, we need human data. AD brain banks provide an invaluable resource. But brain banks almost never provide the time of day when patients died, making it difficult to use these data for rhythms research. We developed CYCLOPS (CYCLic Ordering by Periodic Structure), a machine-learning tool to uncover molecular rhythms using unordered biopsy samples. Evaluating brain expression data, we showed that CYCLOPS could correctly reconstruct rhythms in brain samples and correctly predict the time of death. Here we will order cortical brain samples from control subjects and patients with AD. We will reconstruct the molecular rhythms in these human brains, identifying differences in AD patients and rhythms in known drug targets and AD disease pathways. We will analyze a subset of samples where time of death is known, comparing each subject's “internal molecular time” with the “time on the clock.” We will test the hypothesis that patients with poorly aligned molecular rhythms are more likely to have circadian behavioral disturbance. We will evaluate a measure of transcriptional rhythm strength, testing if “weaker” rhythms predict behavioral or molecular misalignment. Does AD alter rhythm generation? Does it desynchronize still rhythmic cells and brain regions? Using data from multiple brain regions sampled from the same subjects, we will evaluate intracortical circadian synchrony and compare AD patients with controls. Using single-nucleus sequencing data, we will explore the effect of AD on cell type specific rhythms and their synchrony. Finally, we will test the direct influence of important AD causing mutations on molecular clock function, measuring rhythms in isolated cells. This work will advance our understanding of circadian rhythms in AD pathology, clarify the relationship between behavioral and molecular circadian disruption, and catalyze opportunities for AD chronotherapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sleep and circadian disruption are prominent features of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Circadian, or daily, rhythms influence nearly every aspect of our physiology. This work will help researchers understand how molecular rhythms in the brain may influence the progression of AD, contribute to the sleep disruption experienced by AD patients, and influence the time at which AD targeted medications will be most effective.",Circadian Organization and Disorder in Alzheimer's Disease,10046080,R01AG068577,"['Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', '

"Uncoupling Age- Versus Cognitive-Related Cellular Senescence in Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of disability and death in the US and a major global public health problem. Time is running short if we wish to avert a global public health disaster with untold suffering, disruption of families, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies. Effectual solutions will come only from innovative research. While aging is the biggest risk factor for developing AD, it is unclear to what extent normal aging is distinct from AD and which age-related factors drive disease. Senescence is a homeostatic response, which aims to prevent the propagation of these damaged cells while they remain viable and metabolically active. Senescent-like phenotypes have been described in neurons despite neurons being post-mitotic cells and these cells may release factors that trigger senescence in surrounding glia. Senescent glia and senescent-like neurons increase in the brain with age and are thought to contribute to the loss of function associated with aging and age-related diseases like AD. Our application, entitled “Uncoupling Age- Versus Cognitive-Related Cellular Senescence in Alzheimer's Disease,” is highly responsive to the objectives outlined in the RFA-AG-20-025, by leveraging an innovative molecular imaging platform we invented at Stanford; multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI), in order to uncouple age- from cognitive decline-related cellular senescence. MIBI enables us to quantify, with low nanometer resolution, high-dimensional, protein-level expression patterns, single-cell (neuro/immune) interactions, and spatial localization of senescence- and AD- relevant molecules (Aim 1) in a model of healthy aging (Aim 2) and well-characterized cases of AD related cognitive impairment (Aim 3). Importantly, MIBI allows all of this to be accomplished in archival FFPE material, thus allowing retrospective analysis on a variety of existing cohorts. By creating in-depth, phenotypic cellular signatures with spatial context from our unique aging and cognitive cohorts, we will be able to provide insight for modifiable factors promoting cognitive decline by filtering those specifically associated with aging alone. In this research program, collaborative expertise in clinical neuropathology and cognitive decline, technological advancements in imaging, biochemical/molecular and cellular biology, and machine learning analytics converge in this proposed research program to address the spatio-cellular (neuro/immune, senescent) heterogeneity in non-human primate (NHP) and human models of healthy aging and AD brains. Furthermore, it will be synergistic to, and draw on expertise developed in existing infrastructure to image and organize AD clinical pathology (R01AG056287, R01AG057915, MPIs: SC Bendall, RM Angelo, TJ Montine) as well as the NIA-funded 90+ UCI cohort, control material housed in the Stanford ADRC, and NHP specimens (P50 AG047366 co-I: TJ Montine). We will reveal cellular senescent phenotypes that differentiate AD from normal age-associated senescence. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the ageing American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. By using multi- parametric measurements with enabling technologies like multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) we will be able to uncouple unhealthy brain senescence, that could be therapeutically targeted, from that associated with the normal aging process.",Uncoupling Age- Versus Cognitive-Related Cellular Senescence in Alzheimer's Disease,10043941,R01AG068279,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ',

"FiberNET: Deep learning to evaluate brain tract integrity worldwide and in AD ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) threatens to devastate society worldwide. For every 5 years of age over age 65, the prevalence of AD doubles, costing an estimated $277 billion in the U.S. in 2018, a $20 billion increase from the previous year. Here we propose a coordinated global study of brain aging and AD, that uses novel approaches to assess the white matter microstructure of the brain’s neural pathways - a crucial brain metric that breaks down on the pathway from molecular AD pathology to clinical decline. With a novel deep learning tool, called FiberNET, we extract and analyze the brain’s white matter fiber bundles obtained from diffusion MRI (dMRI) scans across the world, and answer 3 key questions: how do the brain’s tracts age worldwide? How does tract aging depend on sex, Alzheimer’s genetic risk, and brain amyloid load? Can tract metrics predict clinical decline better, when combined with standard, accepted biomarkers of AD? The proposal unites experts in AD, neuroimaging, machine learning, and large-scale genomics, to relate new aging metrics (tract microstructure) to protective and adverse factors. Novel mathematics include innovations in picking up crossing fibers and tissue properties from multi- shell diffusion MRI, and convolutional neural nets to learn patterns of aging in neural pathways worldwide. We aim to (1) use FiberNET, our deep learning method, to extract tracts from brain dMRI scans worldwide, and create normative charts for normal tract aging in 20,000 people across the lifespan; (2) ask how the tract aging trajectory depends on sex, the AD protective genotype APOE2, risk genotype APOE4, and brain amyloid load measured with amyloid-sensitive PET. The proposed study will create standardized charts of white matter tract integrity across the lifespan to serve as a guidepost for normative white matter aging. We build on our ENIGMA- Lifespan work - which analyzed brain MRI data from 10,144 people from 91 cohorts - to create lifespan charts for the brain’s major tracts from dMRI, yielding fundamental normative information for comparisons of AD groups worldwide. This lifespan approach will aid the discovery of personal factors that accelerate aging relative to population norms (e.g., sex, APOE genotype, and amyloid load). To ensure the impact of the developments, we created a team of beta-testers to help test and refine the methods, that is tightly integrated into our ENIGMA consortium, which is dedicated to cross-cohort data harmonization. This global approach to aging and AD will offer a new source of power to “break the logjam” in discovering factors that affect the brain as we age. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose a global study of aging and Alzheimer’s disease to examine the aging of the brain’s tracts, or neural pathways, and relate their degeneration to important protective factors and risk factors. We develop new measures of brain aging, based on the white matter fibers in the brain; we ask how their aging trajectory is shifted by sex, genetic risk for AD, and amyloid levels in the brain. This global approach will give scientists a new source of power to “break the logjam” in discovering factors that affect the brain’s neural pathways as we age.",FiberNET: Deep learning to evaluate

"Diversity Supplement for Prioritization of Splicing-Altering Genetic Variants in Alzheimer's disease Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop computational pipelines that allow in silico prediction of functional genetic variants that disrupt pre-mRNA splicing and related pathways in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in AD genomes of various patient cohorts. The next great challenge is to identify causal variants and elucidate their potential function relevant to disease processes. To this end, research efforts have been directed to studying variants located in protein-coding, promoter, and splice site regions due to their apparent impacts on gene expression. However, many of the newly identified disease-associated variants reside in other non-coding regions, such as introns, that may confer regulatory function to the related gene. The mechanisms of these variants have been hard to decipher. It is expected that many of them may function at the post-transcriptional level, thus affecting mRNA expression. In human, a myriad of processes mediate RNA expression at the post-transcriptional stage, one of which being splicing. Splicing is an essential step of mammalian gene expression and alternative splicing affects most human genes. Recent literature reported that RNA splicing is a primary link between GVs and disease. In general, it was estimated that 15-60% of point mutations that result in human genetic diseases disrupt splicing, highlighting the importance of this regulatory step. In AD, aberrant splicing has been detected in many functionally critical genes, some of which are modulated by GVs. Despite the importance, how to accurately identify functional genetic variants in splicing regulation remains a key question in the field. To address this question, the large collection of RNA-Seq and genotyping data sets collected from AD and control subjects represent an invaluable resource. We will develop and apply novel methodologies to make full use of these data sets, complemented by further bioinformatic prediction and experimental validations. This work will allow a previously unattained level of understanding of genetic variants in splicing regulation and provide new means to tackle the imperative task of functional annotations of genetic variants in AD. Project Narrative Alternative splicing can significantly alter gene expression and contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) mechanisms. The proposed research aims to develop computational pipelines, aided by experimental validation, to predict functional genetic mutations or polymorphisms that cause splicing changes in AD. This work will provide mechanistic basis for how genetic variations may contribute to AD, such that future interventions can target specific genes therapeutically.",Diversity Supplement for Prioritization of Splicing-Altering Genetic Variants in Alzheimer's disease,10211993,R01AG056476,"['Affect ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Introns ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Literature ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Michigan ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' mRNA Precursor ', ' Pre-mRNA ', ' RNA, Messenger, Precursors ', ' premRNA ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Rotation ', ' statistics ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Training Support ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Universities ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Point Mutation ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Research Activity ', ' Development Plans ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' RNA Stability ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' career development ', ' RNA analysis ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Research Training ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' Collection ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Genetic Annotation ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' parent grant ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' Ph D student ', ' Ph D. student ', ' Ph.

"Identification and Characterization of Common Pathways across Alzheimer Disease Genotypes using a Multiomic Approach Alzheimer disease (AD) is a multigenic and multifactorial condition with a common pathological hallmark, deposition of Aβ and tau proteins aggregates in the brain. A few genes have been directly involved in the protein deposition metabolism. Another 24 loci have been identified as risk factors for AD which have shed light into other impaired mechanisms. There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how all these pathways are interrelated towards a same ending phenotype. Omic technologies have been instrumental in complementing our understanding of the pathways involved between disruption of particular loci and final pathology. However, each one of these studies only explains a modest portion of the pathology of AD, whilst complex diseases involve a highly dynamic and interactive system of molecular layers. The central hypothesis is that different molecular layers are interconnected in AD so that the dysregulation of any of these causes the ultimate AD phenotype (Aβ and tau proteins aggregates). Multi-omic analysis can provide an insight into how different molecular dimensions interact with each other, an insight that single omic data cannot provide. Also, there is limited availability of multi-omic data collected on the same group of individuals and tissue. The objective of this project is to identify dysregulated pathways consistent across molecilar layers. In the K99 phase of the award, I plan to generate single-omic profiles (transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic) from brain tissue from highly characterized individuals. I will also leverage existing GWAs data for these individuals to conduct pair-wise integrative analysis to identify common variants that act as genetic regulators (QTL) for the identified dysregulated molecular markers. To conduct these analyses, I will gain training in network and pathway analysis, but also in big data and machine learning methods. During this period, I will also receive training in handling of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSc) and in functional analysis. Preliminary analysis using transcriptomic data have identified AGFG2 gene to be overexpressed across AD etiologies compared to controls. AGFG2 is an astrocyte expressed gene that seems to be involved in Aβ metabolism. During the K99 phase I will examine the role of AGFG2 in iPSC-derived astrocytes from AD patients' carriers of known pathogenic mutations (ADAD). Having acquired this knowledge, during the R00 phase I will explore whether dysregulation of AGFG2 has the same effect in ADAD as in iPSC-derived astrocytes from early onset and late onset AD patients. Finally, I will elevate the pair-wise integration of omic data to a meta-dimensional level. This will allow me to identify molecular signals (transcripts, proteins, metabolites) that are consistent across molecular layers. If successful, this project has the potential to reveal novel insights of AD biology, which will be of interest to the scientific community. In addition, with this award I will develop a translational profile which will be invaluable for establishing me as an independent investigator in the growing field of systems biology. Project Narrative This study will use multi-omic data from brain tissue from Alzheimer disease (AD) cases and healthy individuals to identify biological abnormalities that are consistent across molecular layers which will be validated on iPSc. The results will reveal novel understanding of AD and point to new therapeutic targets.",Identification and Characterization of Common Pathways across Alzheimer Disease Genotypes using a Multiomic

"Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer Disease Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias that are associated with major adverse effects on daily function and quality of life, and accelerate time to institutionalization. Of all the NPS, depression is the most frequently observed symptom in people with mild cognitive impairment and early AD. As the disease progresses, agitation, delusions and hallucinations become more common, whereas apathy is the most persistent and frequent NPS throughout all the stages of AD. AD- NPS share some clinical features with serious mental illnesses (SMIs), such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, but whether these conditions share similar aethiopathies is unclear. Given that reliable treatments for NPS in the context of AD and other dementias do not exist, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying NPS in AD and other neuropsychiatric illnesses is a critical next step to identify reliable biomarkers that could lead to novel therapeutics.  There are two overarching goals of this proposal. First, we will identify the molecular mechanisms and neuropathological changes that are associated with the presence of NPS in patients with AD. Second, we will examine if the mechanisms of pathology associated with NPS are shared or distinct among AD and SMIs. More specifically, we propose to build multi-scale integrative models using phenomics and genomics data from 1,264 autopsy cases derived from a single brain bank. The bank includes detailed phenomics data such as well characterized NPS, clinical diagnosis (AD and other neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric traits), severity of cognitive decline and neuropathology for each patient sample. From each case, we will apply innovative approaches that reduce the cost and technical biases associated with conventional methods, and capture gene expression signatures and epigenetic regulatory elements at the single-cell level. Novel deep-learning methods will be applied for the multi-scale integration of neuropathologic changes with genetic markers and functional genomic changes (such as changes in gene expression and enhancer sequences) within specific cell types, to predict various NPS in AD and other neuropsychiatric traits; we refer to these integrative models as genotype- marker-phenotype models. We expect that these models will enable us to assign genotypes and molecular markers to specific NPS within AD and other neuropsychiatric traits at the single-cell level, an unprecedented level of resolution. In addition, we will test the translational potential of the genotype-marker-phenotype models to predict AD-NPS using independent large-scale biobank datasets, in which genotypes and electronic health records are available. Successful completion of the proposed studies will have immediate utility by generating potential biomarkers for NPS diagnosis and prognosis and by providing predictive models for patient stratification in clinical trials. In the longer term, our models will help us create a blueprint for therapeutic strategies and interventions to treat NPS in AD.

"Einstein Aging Study This renewal application in response to the National Institute of Aging program announcement: AR-16-359 NIA – Revision and Resubmission Program Project Applications proposes the addition of a new, one-year project to the Einstein Aging Study program project (NIH/NIA: P01 AG03949). Since 1993, the EAS has been a population based longitudinal study of older individuals residing in Bronx, New York. The program project has long focused on risk factors and cognitive changes that predict the subsequent onset of dementia, particularly Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The proposed work will expand the scope of EAS in a new direction by adding metabolite data related to the exposures of interest in the existing program project. The value of this work is that these new measures and/or a selected combination thereof may serve as early markers for the identification of high risk individuals, and elucidation of potential intervention targets for AD. This will be achieved by leveraging the EAS database and biorepository which contain detailed longitudinal assessments and serial bio-specimens from over 2,200 individuals who have been recruited and followed by the study. These resources will be used to conduct a nested case-control study of incident AD cases and closely matched, cognitively normal controls identified based on longitudinal EAS data. The proposed project will allow us to refine and target a panel of metabolites related to AD risk using an efficient study design and state of the art metabolomics approaches. The long-term goal is to extend this proposed work to examine the association of the identified metabolites with novel ambulatory indicators of cognitive change currently being collected in the EAS projects. The ongoing EAS has an overarching goal of improving the detection of early cognitive change by using advances in ambulatory cognitive assessments that reduce intra-individual variability and improve sensitivity for detecting change. The current projects are currently recruiting and following a new sample of 600 individuals who are completing novel ambulatory cognitive assessments annually. In keeping with this theme, the proposed new project will expand the science of the EAS in a new direction and will lay the foundation for assessing serum biomarkers in individuals who are currently completing annual ambulatory cognitive assessments to determine whether metabolites that predict incident AD may be used to identify individuals at risk for early cognitive decline prior to AD onset. Metabolomics is an emerging field that shows great promise in identifying metabolites that are associated with preclinical abnormalities that predict the onset of subsequent clinical outcomes. The proposed work will expand the scope of the Einstein Aging Study program project (NIH/NIA: P01 AG03949) in new directions by adding metabolite data related to risk factors of cognitive aging and

"Complexity of FMRI in Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary/Abstract Considerable efforts have been spent in the past two decades to search for biomarkers for pre-symptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For neuroimaging, amyloid-PET imaging of amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation in the brain is considered an early marker for the preclinical stage of AD, while tau-PET imaging correlates more closely with neuronal injury and cognitive decline. However, PET scans are expensive and involve radioactive tracers. Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) studies in AD have shown that the functional connectivity (FC) of resting brain networks is progressively diminished in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. However, FC analysis of rs-fMRI has limited capability to characterize the dynamic fluctuations of rs-fMRI signals that possess clinically meaningful information. Our group and others have recently explored the use of entropy measures as indices of the complexity and regularity of rs-fMRI time-series. Accumulating data showed decreasing entropy values associated with aging, APOE ɛ4 genotype, cognitive decline in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD). Our group began developing the Complexity Toolbox in 2013 as the first systematic and comprehensive software package dedicated to complexity analysis of neuroimaging (fMRI) data. In particular, a recent independent study using our toolbox to analyze the rs-fMRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study reported progressive reductions of entropy from healthy controls, early MRI, to late MCI and AD groups, with significant associations between complexity measures of rs-fMRI and cognitive decline in MCI/AD subjects. Our preliminary data in ADAD and LOAD subjects further showed consistent negative correlations between rs-fMRI entropy and tau-PET signal. The goal of this project is to further develop our Complexity Toolbox and a cloud-based pipeline for comprehensive complexity analysis of (large scale) fMRI data. We will systematically evaluate the complexity of fMRI as a novel imaging marker of AD in both ADAD and LOAD populations, using 3 public databases of rs- fMRI and PET including Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), Connectome of ADAD, and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-3) with a total sample size >900. Finally, we will use advanced machine learning techniques to evaluate complexity of rs-fMRI as a predictor for transversion from healthy to MCI and to AD. We will generate a disease staging model based on multimodal AD biomarkers including PET, CSF and rs-fMRI measures. We hypothesize that the complexity of BOLD signals provides an index of the information processing capacity of regional neuron populations, and is therefore sensitive to tau- related neuronal injury and cognitive decline in the AD processes. The successful completion of this project will lead to a noninvasive, economical and alternative imaging biomarker of neuronal injury in MCI and AD with relevant tools ready to be deployed in clinical research and care of AD. Relevance to Public Health Biomarkers for pre-clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have become increasingly important for the development of preventative interventions. For neuroimaging, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau protein provide early imaging markers of AD and can track disease progression but are expensive and require the use of radioactive tracers. This project aims to develop and evaluate a noninvasive, quantitative and economical imaging marker of AD based on the complexity or regularity of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).",Complexity of FMRI in Alzheimer's Disease,9944256,R01AG066711,"['Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', '

"Harnessing Diverse BioInformatic Approaches to Repurpose Drugs for Alzheimers Disease Abstract The exploration of genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes derived from brains with Alzheimer's disease (AD) by powerful computational tools has the potential of developing new knowledge, including the identification of pathways and targets that may be involved in the initiation and/or progression of the disease. The challenge is to find drugs that impact those pathways, and then validate the importance of those pathways – distinguishing primary disease drivers from secondary events. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to probe potential pathways in proof of concept, and ultimately therapeutic, clinical trials. Here, we propose to discover and validate hypotheses for drug repurposing in AD through three integrated, complementary informatics approaches. Specifically, we will apply classical and network aware (prior-loaded) machine learning approaches to identify pathways and targets altered in AD brains at different stages of disease progression using data from Accelerating Medicines Partnership-AD available through Synapse (Aim 1); we will use systems pharmacology approaches to discover the target selectivity of lead compounds in human neuronal and glial cell types using unbiased RNA-seq, proteomic and imaging studies followed by pathway analysis (Aim 2). Each of these two Aims has two approaches: data-driven, hypothesis-generating analyses to discern disease-relevant drug signals; and hypothesis-testing in which positive findings from one approach are evaluated using the other approaches to assess rigor and reproducibility. Moreover, RNA-seq and proteomic data collected in cultured human CNS cell types following exposure to potential disease drivers and/or FDA-approved drugs in Aim 2 will be fed back into Aim 1 as CNS-cell type-derived priors to refine the predictive models. In Aim 3, we will develop new informatics strategies to conduct in-silico drug trials in EHR data with “prospective” outcomes to validate hypotheses based on the omics data sets and extant literature, using two big data sets: the UK 20 year CPRD longitudinal records of 20M National Health Service patients, and the RPDR Database (based at Partners Healthcare) with 6 M individuals followed for over 20 years. This integrated informatics program compensates for the limitations of each individual informatics approach to promote discovery and critical evaluation of “lead compounds” for known and novel AD pathways. To execute this strategy, we have assembled a multi-site, multi-disciplinary team with expertise ranging from clinical care to computer science and systems pharmacology. Some of the team members are AD experts and others bring an outsider's perspective. Finally, as a deliverable, we will create open-source data packages to release all the supporting evidence, software, and data with provenance in accordance with FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible) standards through Synapse and the AlzDataLens platform developed at MGH (Aim 4). These data packages will help to prioritize follow on clinical and translational studies including collaborations with industry or members of the community at large involved in new clinical trials. Project Narrative Repurposing existing FDA-approved drugs is one approach to accelerating proof-of-concept and ultimately therapeutic clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We propose a bioinformatics campaign, parallel to a traditional drug campaign, using available expression data from AD brains in the public domain as our “laboratory” and electronic heath records(EHR) as our “clinical trial infrastructure”. Resulting data packages from these analyses will be shared on Open Science platforms and will help to prioritize follow on clinical and translational studies, ultimately leading to new clinical trials.",Harnessing Diverse BioInformatic Approaches to Repurpose Drugs for Alzheimers Disease,9974450,R01AG058063,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia

"Monitoring real-world driver behavior for classification and early prediction of Alzheimer’s disease This research project tackles the NIH/NIA grand challenge of using a person's own vehicle as a passive-detection system for flagging potential age- and disease-related aberrant driving that may signal early warning signs of functional decline or incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early identification and treatment are essential steps to mitigating the growing costs and burden of AD. Our foundational advancements in quantifying driver behavior from in-vehicle systems (""Black Boxes"") and wearable sensors, and strategic analytic methods and pipelines using statistical and machine learning approaches, are directly relevant to meeting this NIH/NIA challenge. The proposal builds strategically on current project discoveries and successes that comprehensively characterized patterns of real-world driving exposure and risk in 136 older drivers across 500,000 miles driven. Under the proposal's conceptual framework, functional abilities determine specific driver behavior patterns and errors. Behaviors, in tum, index driver functional abilities and clinical features of NIA-Alzheimer's Association (AA) core clinical criteria of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD (operationalized by Alzheimer's clinical syndrome [ACS]). Sleep and mobility play roles as key mediators of relationships between driver behavior and functional impairment. Accordingly, our Specific Aims (SA) are: SA1) Extract key real-world driver behavior features over a continuous, 3-month, baseline period that classify normally aging, MCI, and ACS drivers by NIA-AA core clinical criteria. SA2) Determine the extent to which real-world driver sleep and mobility factors, collected over a continuous, 3-month baseline period, mediate the relationship between extracted driver behavior and clinical features (SA1). SA3) Develop models (statistical and supervised machine learning) that combine features of driver behavior (SA 1) and real-world sleep and mobility (SA2) to detect clinical feature severity of MCI and AD and predict disease progression. To address these aims, our team of experts-in medicine, AD, driving in aging and disease, cognitive neuroscience, transportation engineering, machine learning, computer vision, and longitudinal biostatistics--will apply our approach to drivers with a broader range of impairments across the aging to AD spectrum. A total of 180 drivers, ages 65- 90 years, who have ACS (N=40), MCI (N=80), or are normally aging (N=60) based on NIA-AA clinical criteria will be studied across a 3-month baseline period of real-world naturalistic driver behavior, sleep, and mobility monitoring. Two longitudinal assessments, each 1 year apart, will comprehensively assess each driver's risk for and severity of functional decline. By extracting ""digital fingerprints"" of aberrant driver behavior in drivers al risk for AD, this project complements seismic advances in biologic diagnosis of preclinical AD and advances NIH priorities lo improve older driver safely, mobility, quality of life, with unprecedented access lo diagnostic care. Passive monitoring of real-world behavior to predict clinical status in individuals at risk for AD directly promotes interventions aimed at early treatment of and preventing progression of AD in its preclinical stages. The goal of this research project is to address the NIH and NIA's grand challenge of using a person's own vehicle as a passive-detection system for flagging potential age- and/or disease-related aberrant driving behaviors that may signal early warning signs of functional decline of Alzheimer's disease (AD), even before standard clinical tests do so. Our Specific Aims will assess and combine key factors affecting driver behavior and clinical status in aging, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's clinical syndrome (ACS) as markers and moderators of risk: SA 1) Extract key real-world driver behavior features over a 3-month continuous, baseline period that classify NIA-AA core clinical criteria of MCI and ACS in drivers who are normally aging (N = 60), MCI (N = 80), or ACS (N = 40); SA2) Determine the extent to which real-world driver sleep and mobility mediate the relationship between extracted driver behavior and clinical features; SA3) Develop models (statistical and supervised machine learning) that combine features of driver behavior (from SA 1) and driver sleep and mobility (from SA2) to detect early signs of MCI and AD and predict disease progression. By building on our extensive successes in the current phase, the project directly advances NIH and NIA goals lo detect early warnings signs of decline and incipient AD-with the goal of screening, identifying, and tracking individuals at risk for AD from passive-monitoring of real-world behavior to predict clinical status and progression-promoting early treatment of AD and the next stage of interventions to prevent the progression of AD even in its preclinical stages.",Monitoring real-world driver behavior for classification and early prediction of Alzheimer’s disease,9973716,R01AG017177,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' indexing ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Records ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Weather ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Disease Progression ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' meetings ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' driving behavior ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' functional decline ', ' cost ', ' older driver ', ' digital ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' visuomotor ', ' visual motor ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' analytical tool ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' normal aging ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' clinical predictors ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' urban setting ', ' rural locality ', ' rural place ', ' rural setting ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,954904,0.2720931668077228
"The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as Revealed by Next-Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of disability and death in the US and a major global public health problem. Time is running short if we wish to avert a global public health disaster with untold suffering, disruption of families, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies. Solutions will come only from innovative research. Genomic studies for late-onset AD (LOAD) have identified over 20 risk loci; however, translating the relevant molecules identified by genomics to AD-specific mechanistic pathways has been challenging. Our application, entitled “The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline Revealed by Next- Generation Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging,” is highly responsive to this urgent scientific need by proposing a uniquely innovative molecular imaging platform called multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) that will determine high dimensional protein interactions for AD-relevant molecules identified by genomics studies in normal and pathological states. Our proposal has three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we propose to analyze four regions in healthy aged brains: two sectors of the hippocampal pyramidal layer and from two isocortical regions. Next- generation MIBI instrumentation will be used to image simultaneously 30+ proteins that mark subtypes of neurons, synapses, and non-neuronal cells, while covering regulatory signaling, neuro-inflammatory components, and AD risk gene protein products with subcellular resolution. In Aim 2, we propose to use the same multiplexed imaging methods in AD brain stratified by APOE genotype. We will analyze these data with statistical machine learning methods already established in our laboratory, similar to what we have done previously with different cancers and the immune system. In Aim 3, using infrastructure we have already have established, we will create a web-based portal where all of the images from this study can be accessed, multi- color overlays generated ad hoc, and all the features we derive shared freely. We propose a transformative, collaborative approach to AD that leverages a long-standing NIA-funded longitudinal cohort and is highly responsive to the National Alzheimer's Plan. These novel insights will illuminate pathways that hold potential for new therapeutic targets and will create a shared research resource and analysis platform for the community of scientists committed to developing solutions for AD. Project Narrative AD is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the ageing American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. The overarching goal of this proposal is to generate a phenotypic landscape of cognitive decline, to understand modulation of cognitive decline during compensation and relate genetic predisposition to changes in phenotypic landscape defined by muti-parametric measurements using enabling technologies like multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI).  ",The Phenotypic Landscape of Cognitive Decline as

"TMS in preclinical and prodromal AD: Modulation of brain networks and memory Project Summary  In the prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD), beta-amyloid (AB) and tau preferentially spread throughout the default mode network (DMN) leading to neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction. Episodic memory impairments in AD are thought to arise from the loss of structural and functional connectivity between nodes of the DMN. Emerging evidence from studies with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in young adults demonstrate that the DMN can be modulated in a manner that promotes lasting episodic memory improvement. However, several fundamental questions remain regarding the factors that govern whether rTMS is effective in patients with Alzheimer's pathology and neurodegeneration.  The primary goal of this proposal is to refine our understanding of the mechanisms and therapeutic potential of rTMS for enhancing DMN integrity and episodic memory in individuals with Alzheimer's pathology. 30 patients with prodromal AD, 30 AB+ cognitively normal older adults, and 30 AB- cognitively normal older adults will each undergo 5 days of sham-controlled rTMS preceded and followed by multimodal MRI sessions and cognitive testing. rTMS targets will be established using baseline functional connectivity derived from resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) to determine the region in lateral parietal cortex with maximal functional connectivity to the hippocampus. rsfMRI outcome measures will include functional connectivity between the stimulation site and hippocampus, and intrinsic activity within the stimulation site and hippocampus. AB, tau, and FDG positron emission tomography (PET) scans and structural MRI will be used to quantify the impact of Alzheimer's pathology, hypometabolism, and atrophy on the efficacy of rTMS treatments in each group. All outcome measures will be related to behavioral measures of episodic memory immediately and 2 weeks after the end of treatment. Aim 1 of the proposed project will establish the effects of rTMS on episodic memory in each group. Aim 2 will establish functional network effects of rTMS in each group. Aim 3 will use multivariate regression and machine learning algorithms to identify the biological features that are most useful in predicting whether an individual will benefit from rTMS.  All data collection and analyses will take place at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. During the completion of the project the candidate will receive training in the theory and application of TMS to modulate network function, the use of PET imaging to measure pathology in AD, clinical trial design, and the use of advanced biostatistics for biomarker development and treatment response prediction. The outcome of this research will provide insight into the individuals that are most likely to benefit from rTMS, and will inform future studies seeking to optimize rTMS treatments to improve cognition in dementia. Furthermore, the completion of this project will lay the foundation for the candidate's long-term goal of translating basic neuroimaging findings from healthy aging to direct benefits for patients with Alzheimer's disease. The proposed research examines the potential benefits of non-invasive repetitive transcranial brain stimulation (rTMS) to behavior and memory neurocircuitry in older adults and patients with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. The outcome of this research will provide critical insight into the individuals that are most likely to benefit from rTMS, and to inform future studies seeking to optimize rTMS treatments to improve cognition in dementia. This project is consistent with the NIA’s strategic goal of developing interventions to address Alzheimer’s disease and other age-related neurological conditions",TMS in preclinical and prodromal AD:

"Using connectomics to characterize risk for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION The prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years. While research efforts continue to focus on the causes of AD and to develop effective medical treatments, there is also a pressing need to characterize risk for AD before the disease is diagnosed. There may be subtle changes in brain and cognitive function that are detectable before major symptoms emerge. One approach for characterizing these vulnerabilities is the use of functional and structural neuroimaging to identify risk profiles for AD. The present study proposes and tests a model of AD pathology using neuroimaging network analysis and machine learning approaches to provide insight on widespread changes in information processing in the AD brain. The proposed model hypothesizes that some aspects of network information processing reflect neurodegeneration and cognitive decline associated with AD pathology (e.g., hub connectivity and global connectivity) whereas other network properties reflect attempts to compensate for compromised information processing (e.g., diffusion of information). In addition, this proposal compares the efficacy of models with respect to discriminating diagnostic categories (e.g., machine learning classification of AD and clinically normal subjects) versus isolating underlying dimensions of AD cognitive decline (e.g., machine learning prediction of memory and language scores from network features). Finally, this study will determine whether features of AD pathology are present in an at-risk sample of subjects; namely, individuals diagnosed with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). This will be examined by transferring the AD network models to aMCI subjects and testing whether the model can discriminate aMCI from clinically normal matched controls and whether the model can predict scores on cognitive tests. The analytic approach will using resting state fMRI data as a primary assay of network integrity, but diffusion imaging and task fMRI data will also be examined in an exploratory aim. The general approach will recruit individuals with AD, aMCI and clinically normal matched controls for each diagnostic group. The groups that are compared directly will be matched for amyloid status, as indicated by florbetapir PET imaging. The novel contributions of this project include (a) testing a network model of AD pathology that unifies various measures of network functioning, (b) comparing efficacy of modeling with respect to delineating diagnostic categories versus capturing underlying cognitive dimensions of AD, and (c) transferring the AD model to an at-risk group to assess disease vulnerability. This latter innovation can be applied in future studies to any group of subjects that is defined at risk, such as those with genetic vulnerability or positive family history. The present study also sets the stage for a subsequent longitudinal follow-up study to validate whether individuals identified at risk using network modeling actually convert to AD. Ultimately, network modeling of this sort may be used as a relatively less expensive and less invasive biomarker than PET imaging, which could lead to earlier treatments and interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE With the prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) expected to increase significantly in the next 30 years, there is a pressing need to characterize risk for AD before the disease is diagnosed. The present study will use neuroimaging to examine brain connectivity and determine whether some aspects of altered connectivity are present in individuals who are at risk for AD: individuals who have mild cognitive impairment. This approach could be used in the future to possibly detect risk for AD before any cognitive symptoms emerge, thereby enabling earlier treatment and intervention to combat the devastating cognitive,

"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9979887,R01GM126550,"['Affect ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Biology ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' Label ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' drug sensitivity ', ' Research Activity ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' brain cell ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' Skeleton ', ' Regulation ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' disease subgroups ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' technique development ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' life-style factor ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' patient population ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' machine learning method ', "" Alzheimer's patient "", "" Alzheimer's disease patient "", ' ']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,400001,0.10631509493526464
"Fast multiparametric MR imaging as early biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease Abstract Without a cure or prevention, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) rapidly will become an overwhelming economic and social burden. With the failure of multiple clinical trials targeting reduction of beta-amyloid (Aβ) burden and in general the stagnation of the development of effective treatment for AD, AD community believes that underlying causes of AD must be attacked before emergence of the cognitive phenotype. In this context, the development of predictive biomarkers and models is critical for identifying patients with high risk of rapid progression along the AD continuum, i.e. transitioning from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and from MCI to dementia. Previous AD research has primarily been utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessing morphological changes. Our preliminary results and other studies have shown that quantitative MR parameters such T1, T2, the magnetic susceptibility values are sensitive to normal ageing process and AD. However, their wide spread in AD research protocols has been limited due to scan time constraints. The overarching goal of the proposal is to establish a fast MR technique that does not increase overall scan time of a conventional MR protocol; and in addition to providing all the information the conventional protocol provides, it will also provide multiple quantitative parametric measurements specifically targeted to the needs of AD diagnosis and prognosis. We will 1) develop a fast and motion-insensitive MR technique (M3FAST-ECHO) that can generate multiple quantitative parameters within 10 minutes; 2) validate the volumetric measurement and microhemorrhage assessment from the synthetic 3D T1-weighted and the susceptibility weighted imaging from M3FAST-ECHO against standard ADNI protocol in 30 patients with mild cognitive impairment and 30 aged matched cognitively normal subjects; 3) compare quantitative T1, T2* and quantitative susceptibility values in 30 MCI patients and 30 aged matched cognitively normal subjects, and to correlate these metrics with neuropsychological measurements in the participants. The successful completion of the aims will result in a fast MR technique that provides multiple parametric MR maps without increasing overall scan time, and provide preliminary results for establishing values of quantitative MR parametric maps as sensitive biomarkers of AD. This will greatly enhance our ability to evaluate and screen for early predictive biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease. The inter-disciplinary team and infrastructure for AD research at Emory will ensure successful execution of the study and dissemination of the developed techniques to the entire AD research community. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed project is to develop a fast MR technique that provides multiple parametric magnetic resonance imaging maps without increasing overall scan time, and provide preliminary results for establishing values of quantitative magnetic resonance parametric maps as sensitive biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease.

"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Successful development of small vessel disease (SVD) biomarkers will advance public health by changing the landscape of research, diagnosis, and treatment in vascular and AD dementias, which commonly have mixed pathologies. SVD biomarkers will specifically refine participant selection in clinical trials, improve diagnosis of the most common types of dementia, and advance target selection in studies of the prevention and treatment of dementia in older persons.",Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia.,9995038,UH3NS100599,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sclerosis ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy ', ' Congophilic Angiopathy ', ' cerebrovascular amyloidosis ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Collaborations ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' neuropathology ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' White Matter Disease ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' candidate marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' data sharing ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' vascular risk factor ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' Prevention trial ', ' cognitive ability ', ' AD pathology ', "" Alzheimer's pathology "", "" Alzheimer's disease pathology "", ' MRI biomarker ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' protective factors ', ' in vivo testing ', ' in vivo evaluation ', ' pathology imaging ', ' injury to tissue ', ' tissue injury ', ' religious order study ', ' ']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH3,2020,1319792,0.07678172258705646
"Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and Clinical Alzheimer's Disease in the Framingham Cohorts The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is a prospective, community-based 3-generational study that enrolled participants between ages 20-50 and has examined them every 2-4 years to collect extensive lifestyle, vascular, biomarker data; 9300 have GWAS. Embedded in this cohort are 1036 multigenerational families. Surveillance for AD dementia (and MCI) has been ongoing for over 4 decades. We have identified 1421 incident AD, 1767 MCI, enrolled 800+ in a brain donation program, obtained 7000+ 1.5T brain MRI, and repeated, detailed neuropsychological assessments. We have recently obtained extensive omics in ~6000 (gene expression, methylation, miRNA, metabolomics and proteomics) and genomics (50X whole genome sequences [WGS] in 4197 with pedigree-based imputation to 6554) through the NHLBI funded SABRe CVD (omics) and TOPMed (WGS) programs. We seek to leverage these rich resources (>$25 million). We propose these specific aims: AIM 1 is to examine and explain temporal trends in clinical AD dementia in the FHS cohorts. The age-specific incidence of dementia has declined over the past 4 decades among FHS participants (in press). However, the reasons for this decline remain unclear. We thus propose to continue tracking temporal trends in AD dementia and MCI through intensive surveillance, and verifying diagnoses at autopsy. We hypothesize that better education, treatment of some vascular factors and protective lifestyle changes (diet, activity, social engagement) may partially explain these trends. AIM 2 is to identify the patterns and predictors of preclinical AD within FHS families by obtaining (i) a novel circulating biomarker (plasma tau on 8000+ persons, using samples collected 5-15 years ago and repeat assay in 450) to supplement 1000+ biomarkers already available, and (ii) brain imaging with tau- and amyloid- PET, 3TMRI, including assessment of functional connectivity, tractography and blood flow, in 450 dementia- and stroke-free, FHS participants age 35-75 on whom we have (a) directly verified familial cognition and AD dementia status (both parents and all 4 grandparents were FHS participants), and also (b) have WGS and omics data. AIM 3 is to utilize the available WGS and extensive `omics' data for deep molecular phenotyping of AD. We will undertake conventional family-based WGS analyses of AD dementia and preclinical AD endophenotypes and novel high dimensional (co-expression, network, systems-based) analyses in collaboration with Drs. DeJager (PI of Accelerated Medicine Partnerships-AD, with omics data in 1200 brains), Witten (award-winning mathematician in applying graphical analysis to omics) and Levy (PI of SABRe-CVD at FHS). We will validate our findings in unrelated and multi-ethnic (Omni) FHS participants, through collaborations with other cohorts, and share all data through dbGaP and BioLINCC for analyses by others. We expect to identify new biologic pathways, drug targets and biomarkers for AD, especially those applicable to the preclinical stage of AD and those explaining promising trends in AD risk; such pathways should prove most useful for AD prevention. Whereas the total number of persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) is increasing as the population ages, we have 4 decades of Framingham data suggesting that the risk at any given age is declining. We plan to study the reasons for this hopeful trend in detail through continuing our surveillance for dementia and cognitive impairment, collecting cutting edge brain imaging (amyloid and tau-PET, volumes, connectivity and perfusion on MRI) in the dementia-free (preclinical AD), and using sophisticated analysis of very extensive genetic and omic data already collected on Framingham subjects. This could help us better understand AD trends and biology and identify new biomarkers and treatment targets.   ","Temporal Trends, Novel Imaging and Molecular Characterization of Preclinical and

"CSF, MRI, and PET biomarkers of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorder. Inflammatory changes in the brain are thought to represent key processes in the onset and progression of AD, but it remains unclear whether neuroinflammation confers neuroprotection, accelerated degeneration, or possibly both. Such an understanding in living humans is critical if we are to begin clinical trials using the array of FDA-approved immunomodulatory drugs in the future. We propose that complement- mediated neuroinflammation is protective in the early AD stages, while suppression of complement activities is accompanied by the development of greater cognitive deficits and faster cognitive decline. Our preliminary data from multiple cohorts support this hypothesis by showing 1) reduced levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) complement-related markers occur in the dementia stage but not mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of AD; 2) reduced CSF complement-related markers and elevated CSF interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels are associated with faster decline in AD; and 3) CSF inflammatory protein alterations reveal networks of cellular and protein regulations. In the In the current application, we will build on the association between complement related proteins and rates of cognitive decline in AD to identify associated changes in soluble CSF cytokines and chemokines, differential inflammatory cell type regulation, and imaging correlates of neuroinflammation. This application takes advantage of our group’s strengths in performing CSF cytokine measurements, CSF immunophenotyping, molecular imaging of neuroinflammation through positron emission tomography (PET) and iron-enhanced MRI, and network analysis through a novel biochemical-bioinformatics pipeline. We will directly identify individual and networks of soluble CSF cytokines that accompany the transition from the MCI to the dementia stage of AD, correlate the complement and other altered pathways with microglial activation through two modern PET tracers (11C-PBR28 and 18F-FEPPA), and measure changes in individual T helper cell (type 1, 2, 17) and non-T cell populations. This application represents the first attempt to correlate, at the individual level and at the group level, CSF and imaging measures of neuroinflammation. If successful, this application will advance the understanding of neuroinflammation in AD through parallel approaches, form the basis of a new biomarker panel (and algorithm) to diagnose AD through a combination of degenerative and inflammatory markers, and accelerate the target identification of future therapeutics aimed at modulating the immune system in AD. Brain inflammation is a key event in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease, but it is not clear whether it is harmful, protective, or both. The current proposal aims to confirm our finding that a switch from the protective to harmful type of inflammation predicts more severe symptoms and faster progression in Alzheimer’s disease, and we can identify people with the protective and harmful inflammation by studying the cerebrospinal fluid (circulating proteins and cells) and brain imaging (PET and MRI scans).","CSF, MRI, and PET

"The Macrovascular and Microvascular Contributions to Alzheimer's Disease: MESA VASCAD Project Summary Improving vascular health for delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is identified as a critical goal by the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias Conference, the 2015 NIA AD Summit and PAR-15-356 (to which this application is responding). Yet, critical barriers exist to implementing vascular prevention strategies for AD, and elucidating the role of midlife metabolic, macro- and micro- vascular factors in AD is essential to addressing these barriers. Each type of factor may manifest different pathologies in the brain that contribute to dementia sub-types, making a new and sufficiently comprehensive clinical trial a costly and time-consuming undertaking. To address this essential gap, we propose to leverage the rich longitudinal cohort data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study with the addition of detailed cognitive testing and multimodal brain neuroimaging – the MESA VASCAD study. MESA participants at the Wake Forest site (46% African-American, 54% non-Hispanic Caucasian) have already undergone extensive metabolic and vascular phenotyping, repeated retinal imaging and a brief cognitive assessment in 2010-2012. The MESA VASCAD study will add clinical and cognitive assessments (Uniform Data Set and supplemental cognitive tests); neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid PET); and reanalysis of retinal images. We propose to enroll 540 MESA participants in 2 years and repeat assessments 3 years later to more fully characterize targeted, modifiable vascular risk factors for AD. Through our Specific Aims, we will (1) test the hypothesis that baseline macrovascular and microvascular biomarkers in middle-age predict both standard AD neuroimaging outcomes (e.g. hippocampal volume and amyloid deposition assessed with PET) and more novel cerebrovascular biomarkers (e.g. microinfarcts, lacunar infarcts, neurite density and cerebral microbleeds); (2) determine if changes in metabolic and vascular biomarkers over 15 years predict cognitive and AD biomarker trajectory; and (3) using high-dimensional machine learning approaches, determine common, differential and interactive metabolic and vascular risk factor profiles among racial and APOE genotype groups. This proposed ancillary study, approved by the MESA Steering Committee, is led by a New Investigator with an experienced, multi- disciplinary team of collaborators. The MESA study is an ideal cohort for interrogating the questions in this proposal: it has highly detailed longitudinal risk factor data collected over 15+ years in a diverse cohort, which we can leverage and augment with cerebrovascular biomarkers, AD biomarkers, and cognitive reassessments - thereby creating a comprehensive brain phenotype dataset for vascular and AD risk factors. These new data will enable us to examine the timing and impact of vascular biomarkers on dementia biomarkers and cognitive trajectories before a diagnosis of pre-clinical and clinical AD-related disorders, meeting a critical gap in information that will help guide the development of novel therapeutic or prevention strategies for various forms of AD-related dementias. Project Narrative Vascular and metabolic disorders are proposed as potent modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, and may provide key routes for therapeutic and preventive interventions. We propose to leverage the vast resources of the NIH-sponsored Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study to examine the potential contributions of macrovascular and microvascular subclinical disease to AD-related pathology. At the Wake Forest MESA site, we will add neuroimaging, repeated cognitive testing, and reprocessing of existing digital retinal scans with novel measures of retinal microvascular architecture.",The

"Combine Genomics and Symptoms Data Driven Models to Discover Synergistic Combinatory Therapies for Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary In 2018, an estimated 5.7 million people have Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or a related dementia in the U.S., with related healthcare costs of ~$277 billion1. However, there is no cure yet for AD. One major challenge is that the complicated pathogenesis of AD remains unclear, though >42 genes/loci have been associated with AD2,3. These genes are not actionable or druggable yet for AD management2. Over 240 drugs were tested in clinical trials but no new drugs have been approved for AD since 20031,4. The failure of these drugs is likely, in part, due to the limited efficacy of single agents to treat AD that is a genetically complex, multifactorial disease2, i.e., robust molecular signaling crosstalks among multi-pathways2,5,6,7,8,9, as well as complicated niche factors, e.g., oxidative stress10,11,12,13, and inflammation14,15,16, leading to neuron de-generation. Therefore, combination therapies eliminating these niche factors, and disrupting the dysfunctional signaling pathways and cross-talks, can be more effective than single agents for in AD patients. The goal of this study is to fill the gap of accelerating repositioning of combination therapies for AD using following novel genomics and symptoms data-driven models seamlessly integrating well designed iPSC Aβ AD models. The Washington University Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Knight-ADRC), has generated comprehensive omics data for a large group of AD samples. We propose to (in Aim 1) uncover core signaling pathways and crosstalks of ApoE4 genotype-specific AD subtypes via a novel signaling convergence network model, and consequently to discover synergistic Signaling Network Disruption drug combinations (SNDdc) via novel drug prediction models integrating heterogenous pharmacogenomics datasets. On the other hand, we propose to (in Aim 2) discover potential Neuron Protective drug combinations (NPdc) using electronic health records (EHR), available in BJC HealthCare system (includes 14 academic and community hospitals in Missouri and Illinois), of patients with brain injury diseases, especially Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), via a novel high-order poly-pharmacy efficacy and safety model. We hypothesize that acute brain damage in TBI will share the aforementioned key AD-related niche factors. Also because TBI patients often require multiple drugs daily (high-order poly-pharmacy use), we propose that TBI provides an appropriate model to study synergy and interactions of combination therapies that can ameliorate acute brain injury, and thus suggest potentially neuron protective combinations. Combinations in SNDdc and NPdc provide candidates for novel and effective AD treatment. To filter the false positives, we will (in Aim 3) utilize pooled CRISPR functional genomics and iPSC neurodegeneration model to identify key signaling genes, and validate combination therapies with ApoE4 genotype-specific iPSC Aβ models. Our new models represent a potential breakthrough in AD combination therapies discovery. Project Narrative About 44 million people worldwide are estimated to have Alzheimer disease (AD) or a related dementia. However, there are no effective or curative therapies yet for AD. We propose to discover effective combinatory therapies for AD via data-driven models mining knowledge in heterogeneous pharmacogenomics datasets.",Combine Genomics and Symptoms Data Driven Models to

"Individual differences in dementia spousal caregiver burden: A biobehavioral approach revision Abstract The outbreak of SARS-Cov-2 virus has exasperated the vulnerability of dementia spousal caregivers, as well as those with Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias. SARS-Cov-2 is a highly contagious virus that can cause severe respiratory problems and even death. Older adults and people of all ages with underlying comorbidities are considered to be at “high-risk” for severe illness from COVID-19. During this pandemic, dementia spousal caregivers are tasked with the burden of keeping their spouse safe from getting sick and even dying from COVID- 19, while simultaneously performing their typical caregiving responsibilities. The vast majority of dementia spousal caregivers and their spouses with dementia are over sixty-five years of age, the age bracket that puts people at most risk for COVID-19 disease complications and mortality. Social distancing guidelines make up a large proportion of the current prevention recommendations; thus, loneliness and other negative emotions will likely be frequent and more intense than usual. The proposed competitive revision builds upon the primary aims of the parent grant (R01AG062690) by using attachment theory as an overarching theoretical framework to understand dementia spousal caregiver risk and resilience in light of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 disease). The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PA-18-935, NOT-AG-20-022. Capitalizing on the dementia spousal caregivers who will take part in the parent study, we propose to collect additional data for one week each month for three months. We will collect this data using ecological momentary assessment methods, while passively assessing location, activity, autonomic activity, and sleep via smartphone and smartwatch technology. We aim to understand how emotions, assessed in real-time in the natural environment, affect the extent to which AD spousal caregivers adaptively navigate the challenges associated COVID-19. We will also aim to determine how relatively stable individual difference patterns that originate from people’s close relationship histories (i.e., attachment orientations) inform risk and resilience. As an exploratory high risk/high reward aim, we will evaluate if dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches can incorporate passively collected information (i.e., location, heart rate, heart rate variability, activity, sleep) with information that we learn from our primary aims, to yield a detailed and sophisticated understanding of real-world dynamics that predict three critical COVID-19 specific outcomes: social distancing adherence, social distancing self-efficacy, and caregiver self-efficacy. By understanding patterns of risk and resilience, intervention scientists will be better able to identify at-risk AD spousal caregivers. The proposed research would advance our understanding of how AD spousal caregivers can reduce illness exposure for themselves and those they care for in perhaps the most comprehensive, detailed, real-time, real-world investigation of social distancing in AD spousal caregivers to date. Narrative By identifying the factors that impede social distancing behaviors and impair a dementia spousal caregiver’s confidence to provide care, we will be able to design tailored and targeted interventions to reduce risk of COVID- 19 contagion, and improve quality of life for dementia spousal caregivers.",Individual differences in dementia spousal caregiver burden: A biobehavioral approach revision,10201213,R01AG062690,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Behavior ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Crowding ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' foot ', ' Foundations ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Loneliness ', ' lonely ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Distance ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' spousal care giver ', ' spousal caregiver ', ' spouse care giver ', ' Spouse Caregiver ', ' Caring ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' respiratory ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' interest ', ' contagion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Exclusion Criteria ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' 5 years of age ', ' age 5 years ', ' five year old ', ' five years of age ', ' 5 year old ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' parent grant ', ' high risk ', ' high reward ', ' heart rate variability ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' recruit ', ' smartwatch ', ' smart watch ', ' Infrastructure ', ' risk prediction model ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' 2019 novel coronavirus ', ' SARS-CoV-2 ', ' SARS-CoV2 ', ' SARS-associated coronavirus 2 ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 ', ' SARS-related coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' Wuhan coronavirus ', ' 2019-nCoV ', ' ']",NIA,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,493162,0.08083968267524481
"PREDICT-ADFTD: Multimodal Imaging Prediction of AD/FTD and Differential Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY  Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the most common form of dementia in adults over the age of 65, and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the leading cause of dementia in middle age, with the behavioral variant subtype (bvFTD) being the most prevalent form. The relationships between clinical syndromes and pathological causes are complex, which makes accurate diagnosis difficult. For example, multiple studies have indicated that a significant proportion of cases of AD-like dementia show evidence of non-AD pathology, such as inclusions of the transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a protein associated with clinical FTD. Also, AD neuropathology has been found in 15–30% of patient with the clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). As treatment agents with potential disease-modifying effects are developed, sensitive and specific biomarkers will be needed, so that they can be tested and then eventually used in the appropriate patient populations. In this project, we will focus on clinically diagnosed bvFTD and AD patients, and apply machine learning to multimodal neuroimaging (T1, FDG-PET) data pooled from large, multisite studies of AD and FTD. Our goal is to develop novel biomarkers that can differentiate bvFTD, AD and controls. Our hypothesis is that each neuropathology is associated with a distinct biomarker signature, and these signatures can be discovered through well-characterized clinical, neurological and neuroanatomical profiles. We will use available amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of β-amyloid and tau to assess the robustness of our predictions of AD neuropathologies. In Aim 1 we will use cross-sectional and longitudinal structural imaging to develop predictive biomarker models for differentiating bvFTD vs. AD. In Aim 2 we will use cross-sectional and longitudinal FDG-PET imaging to develop predictive biomarker models. In Aim 3 we will evaluate the combination of structural and FDG-PET imaging as predictive biomarker models.  Relevance: This research supports NIH initiatives on long-term, personalized precision medicine and big data science. Our predictive biomarker models can inform participant selection in clinical trials so that we can identify disease-modifying treatments with greater power. Our system-biology approach can enable us to generate new questions on mechanisms underlying the origin and progression of neuro-pathological processes, create new data and computational tools that can in turn generate new insights and new hypotheses. NARRATIVE  Accurate diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is difficult because the relationships between clinical syndromes, and pathological and genetic causes are complex. In this project, we propose to use machine learning technologies to develop powerful predictive biomarkers that can distinguish bvFTD, AD and healthy controls, using well-characterized clinical, neurological and neuroanatomical data from multiple national databases. As treatment agents with potential disease-modifying effects are developed, sensitive and specific biomarkers can be tested and then eventually used in the appropriate patient

"MIRIAD - Multiplexed Imaging of Resilience In Alzheimers Disease ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a leading cause of disability and death in the US and major global public health problem due to rise in aging population resulting in untold suffering, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies is certain. Solutions will come only from innovative research. Our application is highly responsive to this urgent scientific need by proposing to leverage an innovative molecular imaging platform invented at Stanford, multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI). We will determine the high dimensional cellular and subcellular protein-level expression, interaction, and localization for AD-relevant molecules identified by genomic and proteomic studies in resilience and pathologic states using human brain sections from an ongoing proteomic investigation of AD. We hypothesize that in-depth, stage-specific phenotypic signatures extracted from these unique groups will provide insight into the modifiable factors that endorse the protective mechanisms of brain reserve. We will test our hypothesis through three Specific Aims: (1) Establish a subcellular, phenotypic framework of vulnerable and resistant brain areas. Next-generation MIBI equipment will be used to rigorously image 30+ proteins simultaneously; targets marking subtypes of neurons, synapses, non-neuronal cells, neuro-inflammatory, and vascular components will be concurrently measured. (2) Reveal cognitive resilience multiplexed phenotypes. Using approaches we have successfully applied in other single cell studies, we will analyze multiplexed imaging data with statistical deep learning methods already established in our lab to identify topological, cellular, and molecular phenotypic differences among resilient, co- morbid, and AD dementia. (3) Implement a shared data repository. The power of multiplexed imaging in biology is its ability to reveal co-localization or mutual exclusivity to infer regulatory roles and gain mechanistic insight. To disseminate hundreds of these images from our proposed highly multiplexed study, we will create a web-based portal, using already established infrastructure, where all of the images from this study can be accessed, multi-color overlays generated ad hoc, and all the features will be shared freely. PROJECT NARRATIVE AD is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affect five million or more of the aging American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need to identify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD. Such signatures will provide insight into the modifiable factors that endorse the protective mechanisms of brain reserve. Such insights will illuminate pathways that hold potential for new therapeutic targets, as well as create a shared research resource and analysis platform for the community of scientists committed to developing solutions for AD.",MIRIAD - Multiplexed Imaging of Resilience In Alzheimers Disease,9974453,R01AG057915,"['Abbreviations ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease

"Exploration of MRI measures of neurodegeneration within individuals over short intervals PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY  Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia affect over five million Americans. Alzheimer's disease begins with changes in the brain more than a decade before the disease can be diagnosed from memory and cognitive impairment in a clinic. The goal of this work is to provide a way to measure early signs of neurodegeneration in individual people. The historical barrier to measure change in individuals is that each person's brain is different with change accumulating too slowly to be picked over short intervals. As a result, most research focuses on tracking averaged subject groups or tracking change over multiple years. The present work optimizes new brain imaging techniques using MRI to make extremely fast, highly precise repeated measurements of brain regions all within the same individual. The work then seeks to use the novel imaging approach to measure neurodegeneration in individuals with early stages of Alzheimer's disease in six months or less and also differentiate changes in people with Alzheimer's disease from less common forms of dementia that have distinct anatomical changes in the brain. If successful, the present work will provide a new means to track the early stages of neurodegeneration as would be used in clinical trials and translational medical research. NARRATIVE  The proposed research explores the possibility of precisely estimating change in specific brain structures in individuals at early stages of neurodegeneration. Anchoring from recent developments in fast brain scanning techniques, we use a novel methodological approach that permits a tremendous increase in the precision of measuring change within a single person by repeatedly, safety, and efficiently scanning the brain over time. Demonstrating successful precision measurement within the individual will open opportunities to track therapeutic effects in small samples during early phases of development as well as allow for individualized estimates of neurodegeneration to be made dynamically within the same person. !",Exploration of MRI measures of neurodegeneration within individuals over short intervals,9971052,R01AG067420,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Joints ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Persons ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Pathology ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Semantics ', ' Unmarried person ', ' Maritally Unattached ', ' Single Person ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Amyloid beta-Protein ', ' Alzheimer beta-Protein ', "" Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein "", "" Alzheimer's amyloid "", "" Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein "", ' Amyloid Beta-Peptide ', ' Amyloid Protein A4 ', ' Amyloid β ', ' Amyloid β-Peptide ', ' Amyloid β-Protein ', ' Aβ ', ' a beta peptide ', ' abeta ', ' amyloid beta ', ' amyloid-b protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' tau Proteins ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' tau ', ' tau factor ', ' τ Proteins ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' morphometry ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory impairment ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Mesulam Syndrome ', ' Primary Progressive Aphasia ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' tool ', ' Progressive Aphasias ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Stream ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' American ', ' Brain scan ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' time interval ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' brain volume ', ' Brain region ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' cognitive change ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Therapeutic Effect ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' hippocampal atropy ', ' hippocampal atrophy ', ' normal aging ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' safety testing ', ' rate of change ', ' secondary analysis ', ' clinical translation ', ' imaging based approach ', ' imaging approach ', ' amnestic mild cognitive impairment ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,533173,0.09926047717513066
"Development of Serious Games and Physical Activities Instructed by a Social Robot for Improving the Well-being of Elderly Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia The objective of the proposed direct Phase-II SBIR project is to develop and study and the effectiveness of Serious Games and physical Activities played/performed by elderly people with Alzheimer’s disease and AD- related Dementias in interaction with Ryan, our successfully piloted Socially Assistive Robot (SAR). Ryan is an intelligent conversational life-like social robot, designed to improve the well-being and quality of life of older adults with AD/ADRD. Ryan uses state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence technology for automated facial expression recognition, natural language processing, and tracking of human body that are used in personalization and adaptation of the games and physical activities. According to the Alzheimer’s Association an estimated 5.7 million Americans have AD and is projected to rise to 13.8 million, as the population ages. Common symptoms of AD/ADRD include cognitive decline, short-term memory loss, changes in mood, depression, communication difficulties, lost interest in hobbies or activities, and repetitive behavior. Americans suffering from AD/ADRD are believed to cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Traditional methods for disease management have shown limited success treating AD/ADRD or mitigating its symptoms. Health care personnel and caregivers who are physically and emotionally taxed are seeking new ways to provide care for elderly individuals and particularly those suffering from AD/ADRD. Innovative technology such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, have begun to alleviate the growing need for novel solutions to the healthcare. Among such technologies, socially assistive robots such as Ryan have received a great amount of attention in recent years. While SAR research prototypes exist that can interact with users playing physical cognitive games equipped with artificial intelligence technology and personalization, to our knowledge, no such cooperative SAR (prototype or commercial) for electronic gameplay with individuals suffering from dementia exists today. Our game designs will target “Cognition”, “Memory”, “Spatial Relation”, “Social Relationship”, and “Motor Skills” abilities of players. We will conduct a pilot study to measure Ryan’s effectiveness in mental and socio- emotional stimulation of users with mild dementia. This innovative technology stands to produce significant financial savings and improve the quality of life of individuals living with AD/ADRD, their families, and caregivers. The goal of the project is to develop serious games and physical activities co-played by a socially assistive robot companionbot (Ryan) for improving the quality of life of persons with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Americans suffering from AD cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Successful development of Ryan will improve patient well-being, make caregivers more efficient and effective, and provide significant financial benefits to the healthcare industry, and assist families

"Blood Base Bioenergetic Profiling: A Novel Approach for Identifying Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Pathology 7. Project Summary/Abstract  In Alzheimer's disease (AD), irreversible neurological damage takes place years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, it is recognized that the development of AD dementia treatment and prevention strategies relies on the early detection of presymptomatic pathology. Previous studies demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathophysiology of AD and precedes the formation of plaques and tangles that are hallmarks of this disease. The premise of this study is based on the unique sensitivity of the brain to systemic bioenergetic decline due to its exceptionally high metabolic demand. We hypothesize that bioenergetic capacity is related to early AD pathology and that bioenergetic decline is associated with the long term progression and severity of this disease. Recent work by our group and others demonstrate that blood- based bioenergetic profiling, utilizing cellular respirometry, provides a reliable measure of systemic mitochondrial function. The proposed study will determine whether blood cell bioenergetics is related to AD risk, pathology, cognitive performance, and changes in these parameters over time. Our long term goal is to develop a minimally invasive screening tool that can be used in a clinic/community setting to identify candidates for more intensive diagnostic testing, such as CSF biomarker analysis and brain imaging.  This project will be completed in an efficient and cost-effective manner by leveraging resources provided by the NIA-funded Wake Forest Alzheimer' Disease Center Clinical Core (ADCCC). Participants in the ADCCC represent a spectrum of AD risk and disease progression and are being extensively characterized for AD pathologies at baseline and 3 year follow ups. Our preliminary data from ADCCC participants indicate that bioenergetic capacity, measured in blood cells, is lower in participants with mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, our data suggest that bioenergetic deficits are already apparent in cognitively normal participants at high risk for AD. The aims of the proposed study are: 1) To determine bioenergetic profiles most strongly associated with AD risk and reporters of AD pathology (cognitive performance, CSF Aβ42/tau, hippocampal volume, brain amyloid, and cerebral glucose metabolism); 2) To determine the changes in bioenergetic profiles related to the 3 year progression of cognitive decline and reporters of AD pathology; and, 3) To determine the relationships of mitochondrial content and inflammation with bioenergetic capacity, and reporters of AD pathology at baseline and at follow-up. A central goal of the proposed study is to determine the specific bioenergetic parameters that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Therefore, in addition to convention analytical approaches, we will employ state of the art Machine Learning analyses to identify individual parameters or multivariate signatures that are most closely associated with AD risk and pathology. Completion of this project can impact the detection of presymptomatic AD, provide insights into mechanisms underlying bioenergetic decline associated with AD, and broadly advance translational bioenergetics research. 8. Project Narrative  It is widely recognized that the implementation of successful Alzheimer's disease prevention and treatment strategies rely on the identification of patients at risk for developing the disease. The proposed project will examine blood based bioenergetic profiling as a minimally invasive strategy for determining Alzheimer's disease risk and presymptomatic pathology.

"Towards a better understanding of genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease with human iPSC models PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia with high heritability (~70%). It is increasingly clear that AD is highly polygenic, and for most of AD cases it is the polygenicity of the risk variants across the genome that predisposes the disease risk. In contrast to the rapid identification of risk loci associated with AD by recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS), identifying the potential causal variants/genes at the reported risk loci and decoding these variants/genes into molecular and cellular pathology have lagged far behind. Since disease variants, mostly locating in noncoding regions of the human genome, have been shown to affect cellular function through multi-level regulations such as DNA accessibility and histone modifications, DNA methylation and RNA expression in a cell type-specific manner, comprehensive and unbiased investigating the cell type-specific influence of generic risk variants on AD risk at multiple levels, including epigenomic, transcriptomic, and cellular levels, in an isogenic background is crucial to understand the genetic basis of AD pathogenesis. In the current application, by combining human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) with gene editing and comprehensive multi-omics and cellular analyses, we will dissect the AD genetic risk variants into cell type-specific molecular and cellular pathology. Given the polygenic nature of AD, and the heterogeneity of AD risk genes on the cellular level, we hypothesize that multiple genetic risk variants act synergistically among different compartments (e.g. cell types) to contribute to pathogenesis of AD. First, we will identify AD risk variants and genes with comprehensive analyses of AD genetic architecture using machine learning approaches including DVAR, eVAR and iRIGS (Aim 1). Second, we will delineate the cell type-specific epigenetic and transcriptomic signatures associated with AD candidate risk variants using human iPSC-derived neurons/microglia/astrocytes (Aim 2). Last, we will determine the functional impact of AD candidate risk variants on AD-like cellular pathology in neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and their co-cultures (Aim 3). Our proposal may advance our understanding of the complex genetic architecture of AD, leading to a better understanding of AD pathogenesis and facilitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia with high heritability. Although recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AD have identified more than 20 risk loci, the genetic etiology of AD leading to molecular and cellular pathology remains largely unknown. By combining human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) with gene editing and comprehensive multi-omics and cellular analyses, our investigation will reveal the cell type-specific effects of AD genetic risk variants on AD pathogenesis, which may advance our understanding of genetic architecture of AD and disease etiology, and lead to therapeutic advances.",Towards a better understanding of

"Genetic Predictors, Transcriptomic Biomarkers, & Neurobiological Signatures of Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary Over the last decade, scientists have accelerated their efforts to understand Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This has led to unprecedented knowledge of the genetic and biological bases of AD risk, and vast stores of valuable data for further mining. Understanding the genetic and biological risk states for AD is, in itself, extraordinarily valuable for guiding mechanistic studies, developing better diagnostics, and formulating therapeutics. But an understanding of risk states also has the benefit of allowing research on resilience to AD. Research on the genetic and biological bases of resilience necessarily lags behind the discovery of risk factors. Now, as the risk architecture of AD is coming into view, it is feasible to study resilience to AD in individuals who are cognitively normal despite being at elevated risk for the disease. The approach we have devised for identifying resilience factors is straightforward yet, to our knowledge, unprecedented. We identify unaffected individuals at the highest levels of multivariate risk, match them to affected individuals at equivalent levels of risk, and contrast these two subgroups to find residual variation associated with the absence of disease. In this project, we will capitalize on the wealth of existing high-throughput AD risk-factor results and data, and our involvement in many of the world’s largest AD consortia, to efficiently map resilience to AD at three levels (genetics, transcriptomics, and neuroimaging), and to integrate across these levels. In Aim 1, we will identify genetic variation associated with resilience to AD in the presence of elevated genetic risk conferred by APOE ε4 alleles, an elevated AD polygenic risk score, or an elevated AD polygenic hazard score. In Aim 2, we will mega-analyze all available transcriptomic data from studies of postmortem hippocampal tissue and of peripheral blood in AD to identify transcriptomic risk scores and machine-learning algorithms that maximally distinguish AD from cognitively normal control subjects, and scores and algorithms that then identify residual transcriptomic variation that offsets the transcriptomic risk in resilient controls. In Aim 3, we will identify an MRI-based structural brain signature that is associated with resilience to AD in the presence of an AD- associated cortical risk signature. Lastly, in our exploratory Aim 4, we will integrate genetic, transcriptomic, brain structural, and clinical data to identify biological relationships across Aims, and novel phenotypes of resilience. Collectively, these Aims will identify multivariate, genetic, transcriptomic, and brain-structural profiles of resilience to AD, as well as molecular, neurobiological, and clinical phenotypes stemming from AD- resilience genotypes. Project Narrative Not all people at high risk for Alzheimer's disease develop the disorder. This project aims to identify genes, molecules, and brain structures that protect some people from their otherwise-elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease. Finding the biological basis for resilience to Alzheimer's disease may shed light on better options for diagnosing, treating, and even preventing the illness, in ways that can't be found by only studying people who already have the disease.","Genetic Predictors, Transcriptomic Biomarkers, & Neurobiological Signatures of Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease",10017121,R01AG064955,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' apolipoprotein E-4 ', ' APOE e4 ', ' APOE-ε4 ', ' APOEε4 ', ' apo E-4 ', ' apo E4 ', ' apo epsilon4 ', ' apoE epsilon 4 ', ' apoE-4 ', ' apoE4 ', ' apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 ', ' apolipoprotein E4 ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' brain tissue ', ' interest ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Prevention ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Sampling ', ' Brain region ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Molecular ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' resilience ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' stem ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' phenome ', ' genetic predictors ', ' Genetic study ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' secondary analysis ', ' high dimensionality ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' structured data ', "" Alzheimer's brain "", "" Alzheimer's disease brain "", ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NIA,UPSTATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,760528,0.38398734232897574
"Rapid Profiling of the Plasma Proteome and Machine Learning Analytics for Non-Invasive Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease ABSTRACT The main objective of this project is to develop an innovative blood-based test for highly sensitive and specific, non-invasive and cost-efficient diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which would leverage Seer's proprietary Proteograph platform enabled by the convergence of nanotechnology, protein corona, proteomics, and data science. Beyond neuropsychological testing, two approaches have thus far been clinically validated for AD detection, including neuroimaging and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based biomarkers (e.g., amyloid-β or Aβ). In contrast to the neuroimaging (which is expensive and time-consuming) and CSF analysis (which is less expensive, but involves an invasive lumbar puncture procedure), a blood-based test for AD diagnosis has the potential to be dramatically less costly and easier to implement. Nevertheless, the search for reliable blood- based biomarkers has been challenging and the blood-based detection using ELISA or other epitope-based methods that go after a few biomarkers (e.g., Aβ42 or Tau) have not been successful, presumably owing to the vast dynamic range and high complexity of the plasma components. We have recently demonstrated that our multi-nanoparticle (NP) protein corona technology can facilitate broad and deep profiling of plasma proteome, and by combining with machine learning approaches, could lead to the development of Proteograph classifiers for highly accurate detection of different diseases including AD. As compared to current mass spectrometry- based proteomic techniques that require complex and time-consuming depletion or fractionation workflows for detection of low abundance/rare proteins, our multi-NP protein corona strategy is fast and high-throughput for analysis of the vast body of information in the proteome. In this Direct Phase II project, we will build upon the proof-of-concept studies to further test how Seer's Proteograph platform can be applied to develop a robust blood-based test to detect AD. Specifically, we will identify a panel (~6-10) of NPs from Seer's NP library for broad and deep coverage of the plasma proteome of AD patients (Aim 1); develop Proteograph classifiers and identify the proteins critical for classification through machine learning of the proteomic data generated from the panel of NPs with a cohort of 150 plasma samples of AD and healthy controls (Aim 2); and validate the accuracy of the detection test (based on the important proteins identified in Aim 2) in a separate blind cohort of 450 Aβ-positive AD patients and healthy controls (Aim 3). We expect that the successful completion of this SBIR project will lead to the clinical use of a blood-based AD test, which could further benefit earlier treatment, therapeutic outcomes, and health costs and quality of life for the elderly. NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the 6th-leading cause of death in the United States, and it is projected that nearly 14 million Americans will be living with AD by 2050, according to the Alzheimer's Association, translating to a healthcare cost of ~$1.1 trillion. Accurate and early identification of AD, ideally at the earliest symptomatic or even pre-symptomatic stage, could facilitate better monitoring of therapy response and better planning for the care of family members with the disease, thus offering a tremendous economic impact. In this Direct Phase II SBIR project, we will develop a highly sensitive and specific, non-invasive, and cost-effective blood-based test for routine diagnosis of AD, which represents one of the greatest medical challenges of this era.",Rapid Profiling of the Plasma Proteome and Machine Learning Analytics for Non-Invasive Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,10002170,R44AG065051,"['Elderly ', '

"AMYLOIDOGENIC INDUCTION OF CELLULAR SENESCENCE IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular senescence, one of the major hallmarks of aging, describes the sudden inability for cells to divide. Senescent cells often accumulate with age, in response to physical and chemical stressors (genomic instability, telomere attrition, irradiation, etc.), though the overlap between these stressors and neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is currently unknown. In-vitro experiments of senescence often utilize contrived stressors such as hydrogen peroxide or radiation, that may not be physiologically relevant for age-related diseases such as AD. Furthermore, the senescence phenotypes observed in vitro are likely not complete models for what is occurring in dynamic biological systems.  Soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (Abo), an important hallmark in AD, have been shown to potently induce senescence in a variety of brain cell types and environments, in contrast to fibrillar Ab. Abo is thought to bind membrane proteins and subsequently signal downstream aggregation of related amyloids such as tau. In fact, the presence of endogenous Abo is one of the strongest indicators of disease severity in AD models and organisms, suggesting a link between AD and cellular senescence that is only beginning to be explored.  In order to study this association, we propose to combine gold-standard techniques and single-cell omics data in order to define heterogenous genetic and epigenetic signatures of senescence that are distinctly a function of their induction type. Doing so will also produce robust signatures and biomarkers of senescence in brain cells that can be utilized for the pathological phenotyping of human tissues. These measures will also allow for the comparison of disparate senescent behaviors to help identify lab-derived amyloids that best resemble patient-derived constructs. We will evaluate multiple lab-derived Abo constructs, including those stabilized from lipids located in predominantly diseased regions of the brain. Observations would be synergistically coupled with solution biophysics experiments and molecular modeling, providing analogous structural data for each inducer type. Taken together, these measurements will uniquely profile senescence in brain cells, define the degree of overlap between endogenous senescence inducers and those reconstituted in the lab, and highlighting how AD risk is modulated by cellular senescence. PROJECT NARRATIVE One of the most well-known hallmarks of human aging is cellular senescence; however the relationship between senescence and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is poorly understood. We hypothesize that soluble amyloids, but not fibrils or plaques, link the induction of cellular senescence in brain cells to neurodegeneration, yet it remains unclear which soluble amyloids modulate these behaviors. In order to test this hypothesis, we will utilize a combination of genetic and epigenetic measurements to compare the ability of synthetic and patient-derived amyloids to induce senescence in brain cells, thereby deducing the molecular and epigenetic overlap between senescence and AD.",AMYLOIDOGENIC INDUCTION OF CELLULAR SENESCENCE IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE,10044065,R01AG068285,"['Affect ', ' Age

"Interpretable Machine Learning to Identify Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutic Targets Project Summary Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an urgent national and international research priority. Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the hallmark of AD. Their building blocks are Amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, respectively. At present, we lack an understanding of the set of genes that affect formation of plaques and tangles along with protective and pathological responses to these toxic peptides. Biologists are now gathering gene expression data and Aβ and tau measures from human brain tissues. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (here, gene expression levels) that best predict an outcome (Aβ or tau level). The identified features, biomarkers, can help determine the molecular basis for plaques and tangles. Unfortunately, false positive biomarkers are very common, as evidenced by low success rates of replication in independent data and low success reaching clinical practice (less than 1%). We seek to radically shift the current paradigm in biomarker discovery by resolving three fundamental problems with the current approach using novel, theoretically well-founded machine learning (ML) methods to learn interpretable models from data. Aim 1. Learn an interpretable feature representation from publicly available, high-throughput brain data. High-dimensionality, hidden variables, and complex feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., observed statistical associations) and true biological interactions. To increase the chance to identify true positive biomarkers, we need new feature selection criteria to learn a model that better explains rather than simply predicts the outcome. To do so, our proposed ML algorithms will identify the genes that are likely to give a meaningful explanation of the outcome (Aβ or tau level) by inferring both the functions of genes in the cellular processes contributing to AD and the gene interaction network from many existing brain datasets. Aim 2. Make interpretable predictions using a unified framework to explain model predictions. Due to disease heterogeneity, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) often more accurately describe relationships between genes and an outcome than simpler, linear models, but lack interpretability. We will develop a novel ML framework that interprets complex model predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a specific prediction, which will identify features of high importance for each individual as personalized markers and classify subjects based on these importance estimates. Aim 3. Validate the identified candidate biomarkers using powerful worm models of AD. Analyzing observational data without doing interventional experiments cannot prove causal relationships. In collaboration with co-I Matt Kaeberlein, we will utilize powerful nematode models of AD to test our hypotheses on the role of certain genes as disease modifiers, and develop a new way to refine the models based on this knowledge. Successful completion of this project will result in previously unknown molecular basis for Aβ and tau levels, potential therapeutic targets, and general ML techniques widely applicable to many other data science problems. Project Narrative In the United States alone, someone receives an Alzheimer’s diagnosis every 66 seconds, and the disease has become the 6th leading cause of death in this country; Alzheimer’s disease (AD) currently has no cure, no prevention, and no treatment to reverse or halt its deadly progression. The recent, rapid growth of gene expression data from human brain tissues hold great promise for identifying therapeutic targets, but extremely low success rates to identify true positive biomarkers indicate fundamental problems with the current computational approach being used. We seek to revolutionize the way we identify drug targets by developing novel machine learning techniques that extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data, combined with biological validation in an animal model of AD.",Interpretable Machine Learning to Identify Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutic Targets,9864003,R01AG061132,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's

"3D Reconstruction and Analysis of Alzheimer's Patient Biopsy Samples to Map and Quantify Hallmarks of Pathogenesis and Vulnerability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This project will expand the acquisition, reconstruction, analysis, and dissemination of 3D electron microscopic (3D EM) reference data, disclosing key ultrastructural details preserved within a remarkable collection of legacy biopsy brain samples from patients suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). These samples were originally collected, characterized and archived by neuropathologists R.D. Terry and N. Gonatas (at A. Einstein in the 1960’s), with later samples taken as part of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drug infusion study involving S. Mirra (at Emory in the 1980’s). They were re-examined by Ellisman, Masliah, Terry, and Mirra in the 1980s, using early 3D EM methods, and were found to manifest excellent preservation of ultrastructure, showing paired helical filaments (PHF) and amyloid accumulations as well as modifications to subcellular organelles and cytoskeletons of the cell bodies, axonal and dendritic processes. Here, we will exploit recent advances in high throughput, automated 3D EM to massively scale the examination of these precious samples, reconstructing 100s of brain cells with and without PHF, tracking axons (and mapping glia and synapses) through much greater brain volumes than was feasible previously. Our goal is to target areas associated with both plaques and tangles, attending to locations where existing findings suggest cell and network vulnerability and contain molecular interactions suspected by some to underlie the initiation and progression of AD. Supporting investigations into the progression of soma/dendritic degeneration, we will target cells operationally defined to represent a progression of neuronal decline as seen in AD; determining the volume fraction of PHF in the cytoplasm as a practical staging measure and linking this to the characterization of quantitative changes in the microstructure of major subcellular constituents. Likewise, we will analyze the progression of axonal degeneration in and near plaques as data obtained suggests that axons may become dystrophic before their parent cell bodies and their dendrites degenerate. NARRATIVE This project will expand the acquisition, reconstruction, analysis, and immediate dissemination of 3D electron microscopic (3D EM) reference data, disclosing key ultrastructural details preserved within a remarkable collection of legacy biopsy brain samples from patients suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Our focus is to examine regions of acute interest, based on our own observations and insight offered from current AD literature, at a resolution sufficient to quantitatively assess suggested markers of AD-associated pathogenesis, link to biochemical data on molecular structures from studies on humans and mouse models of AD, and motivate future hypothesis driven research.",3D Reconstruction and Analysis of Alzheimer's Patient Biopsy Samples to Map and Quantify Hallmarks of Pathogenesis and Vulnerability,9867232,R01AG065549,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Archives ', ' Award ', ' Axon ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biopsy ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cataloging ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Cytoplasm ', ' Cytoskeletal Filaments ', ' Cytoskeleton ', ' Cellular Matrix ', ' Cytoskeletal System ', ' intracellular skeleton ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Dendrites ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electrons ', ' Negative Beta Particle ', ' Negatrons ', ' Endoplasmic Reticulum ', ' Ergastoplasm ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Golgi Apparatus ', ' Golgi ', ' Golgi Complex ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Scanning Electron Microscopy ', ' Microtubules ', ' Micro-tubule ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Molecular Structure ', ' Macromolecular Structure ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Neuroglia ', ' Glia ', ' Glial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Neuroglial Cells ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Nonneuronal cell ', ' nerve cement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Nuclear Pore ', ' Organelles ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Running ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' tomography ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Neurites ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' tangle ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Microscopic ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Funding ', ' ER Positive ', ' ER+ ', ' Estrogen receptor positive ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Catalogs ', ' Investigation ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Location ', ' brain tissue ', ' interest ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' brain cell ', ' paired helical filament ', ' Performance ', ' neural cell body ', ' soma ', ' neuronal cell body ', ' cellular targeting ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' brain volume ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Amyloid Fibrils ', ' Data ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' cell imaging ', ' cellular imaging ', ' Output ', ' axon degeneration ', ' degenerative axon ', ' axonal degeneration ', ' electron tomography ', ' reconstruction ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' data acquisition ', ' Image data archive ', ' image archive ', ' image library ', ' picture archive ', ' image archival system ', ' open source ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' AD model ', ' alzheimer model ', "" Alzheimer's disease model "", ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' web portal ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' preservation ', ' model of human ', ' human model ', ' deep learning ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', "" Alzheimer's patient "", "" Alzheimer's disease patient "", ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,746606,0.2442392815959993
"PREDICT-ADFTD: Multimodal Imaging Prediction of AD/FTD and Differential Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY  Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the most common form of dementia in adults over the age of 65, and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the leading cause of dementia in middle age, with the behavioral variant subtype (bvFTD) being the most prevalent form. The relationships between clinical syndromes and pathological causes are complex, which makes accurate diagnosis difficult. For example, multiple studies have indicated that a significant proportion of cases of AD-like dementia show evidence of non-AD pathology, such as inclusions of the transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a protein associated with clinical FTD. Also, AD neuropathology has been found in 15–30% of patient with the clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). As treatment agents with potential disease-modifying effects are developed, sensitive and specific biomarkers will be needed, so that they can be tested and then eventually used in the appropriate patient populations. In this project, we will focus on clinically diagnosed bvFTD and AD patients, and apply machine learning to multimodal neuroimaging (T1, FDG-PET) data pooled from large, multisite studies of AD and FTD. Our goal is to develop novel biomarkers that can differentiate bvFTD, AD and controls. Our hypothesis is that each neuropathology is associated with a distinct biomarker signature, and these signatures can be discovered through well-characterized clinical, neurological and neuroanatomical profiles. We will use available amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of β-amyloid and tau to assess the robustness of our predictions of AD neuropathologies. In Aim 1 we will use cross-sectional and longitudinal structural imaging to develop predictive biomarker models for differentiating bvFTD vs. AD. In Aim 2 we will use cross-sectional and longitudinal FDG-PET imaging to develop predictive biomarker models. In Aim 3 we will evaluate the combination of structural and FDG-PET imaging as predictive biomarker models.  Relevance: This research supports NIH initiatives on long-term, personalized precision medicine and big data science. Our predictive biomarker models can inform participant selection in clinical trials so that we can identify disease-modifying treatments with greater power. Our system-biology approach can enable us to generate new questions on mechanisms underlying the origin and progression of neuro-pathological processes, create new data and computational tools that can in turn generate new insights and new hypotheses. NARRATIVE  Accurate diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is difficult because the relationships between clinical syndromes, and pathological and genetic causes are complex. In this project, we propose to use machine learning technologies to develop powerful predictive biomarkers that can distinguish bvFTD, AD and healthy controls, using well-characterized clinical, neurological and neuroanatomical data from multiple national databases. As treatment agents with potential disease-modifying effects are developed, sensitive and specific biomarkers can be tested and then eventually used in the appropriate patient

"Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network (PeCAN) Program for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias ABSTRACT Our healthcare system faces larger numbers of individuals with early to late Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders requiring anesthesia associated procedures for serious health related conditions (e.g., cardiac), screening (e.g., colonoscopy), or quality of life improvement (e.g., joint replacement). Despite evidence that preoperative cognitive status is a risk factor for negative post-operative outcomes, there is a scarcity of research addressing perioperative cognitive-biomarker-anesthesia interactions, and evidence based anesthesia-surgical practices for patients with prodromal or diagnosed dementias. The K07 applicant- an NIH funded independent investigator and board certified neuropsychologist with expertise in the cognitive sequelae and associated neuroimaging markers of AD, vascular dementia, and other neurodegenerative disorders, and cognitive and neuroimaging predictors of perioperative cognitive complications and delirium. The applicant (with support of the institution) is proposing a Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network (PeCAN) Program for AD and related dementia. The purpose– to promote institutional and community awareness of cognition and memory in older adults electing surgical procedures with anesthesia, intensify collaborations on AD biomarkers- anesthesia interactions, and promote translation of research findings to clinical care. The applicant will complete advanced leadership training and three programmatic aims. Aim 1- convene a multidisciplinary advisory team to establish four integrated PeCAN research cores targeting AD and related dementia perioperative research. Cores include a Cognitive-Clinical Core, a Neuroimaging Core, a Biomarker Core, and a Data Science Core. Aim 2- enhance defined and supportive pathways to the PeCAN cores so that early stage investigators can efficiently initiate and complete perioperative-neurodegenerative research. The applicant will integrate pathways between multiple institutional resources including NIH funded 1Florida Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, Evelyn F. McKnight Brain Institute, the University of Florida (UF) Institute on Aging Pepper Center, and the UF Fixel Center for Neurological Diseases. Aim 3- promote the emergence of highly trained scientists and educators for innovative team science addressing perioperative neuronal risk and mechanisms for protection. Methods will involve implementation of a certificate program, interdisciplinary team-science research opportunities, and pilot funding supported through this grant and institutional matching funds. Trainees will initially include appropriate predoctoral T32 trainees, neuropsychology fellows, and anesthesiology fellows. Milestones- annual analyses of programmatic strengths/weaknesses, multidisciplinary proposal submissions, and evidence of trainee success with perioperative research for AD and related dementias.  Narrative Despite expected exponential increases in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, and an overabundance of research indicating that preoperative cognitive impairment is a major risk factor for negative post-operative outcome, we know very little of AD cognitive, biomarker, and anesthesia/surgical interactions and have little to no evidence-based perioperative medical care strategies for AD patients. Via the K07 mechanism and institutional support, the applicant will leverage novel perioperative clinical and state-of-the-art institutional facilities to develop an institutional wide research and training program addressing these problems. The proposed program will result in improved awareness of cognition and memory status in older adults prior to surgical procedures with anesthesia, intensify collaborative research addressing brain-behavior-anesthesia interactions through both animal and human research approaches, and promote translation of research findings to clinical care.",Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network

"Assessing ASL CBF as a biomarker for early Alzheimer's disease detection and disease progression ABSTRACT. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting tens of millions of people. A top research priority in AD is to find a biomarker sensitive to early disease and disease progression because that will likely provide the best opportunities for searching and evaluating effective treatments for this currently incurable brain disease. Human brain relies on cerebral blood flow (CBF) for its energy supply and waste removal. Previous research has indicated that CBF reductions cause neuron inactivity and neurotoxic waste accumulation and subsequently neuron death, which may eventually lead to AD dementia. Measuring CBF and following its longitudinal course may then provide a highly potential biomarker for early AD and its progression. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI is a technique for quantifying CBF without using exogenous tracers. Because it is relatively cheaper and can be repeated many times, it is well suited for longitudinal AD research. Sensitivity of ASL MRI to AD and prodromal AD has been shown in many cross-sectional studies (comparing AD to controls) by other groups and us. But several important questions still remain unanswered including the prediction power of ASL CBF for early AD and AD progression, the longitudinal CBF change patterns, and sex difference of CBF in AD. Addressing those questions needs large size longitudinal data and expertise for analyzing ASL MRI data due to the low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The purpose of this project is to address those open questions by leveraging our extensive expertise on ASL MRI and the accumulating longitudinal ASL data from ADNI (a large ongoing multi-site AD neuroimaging study). The novel information or outcome from this project will include the prediction power of ASL CBF for early AD, CBF change rate when disease progresses or reverts, gender effects in AD and its progression, and a next-generation ASL MRI processing algorithm based on deep-machine learning (DL), and a DL-based AD prediction model. We will first confirm our previous ADNI ASL CBF findings using larger sample and updated methods (not available before). We will then check sensitivity of ASL CBF for tracking and predicting disease progression or cognitive declines. Gender effects on CBF in AD will be explicitly examined, which may reveal a clue for the higher prevalence of AD in females. We will revisit those studies using the DL-based ASL denoising algorithm. Pursuing those aims will help establishing ASL CBF as an AD biomarker and provide a versatile AD prediction model using ASL CBF as well as other valuable biomarkers provided in ADNI. Developing and sharing the DL ASL MRI denoising method will benefit not only AD research but also the various scientific projects based on ASL MRI. The feasibility of this innovative but clinically important project is ensured by our decades of experience and the substantial pilot investigations in each aspect of the study, including ASL MRI, AD ASL study, and machine learning. Identifying biomarkers sensitive to early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its progression is central to AD studies. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) will be measured using arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI and assessed for early AD detection and progression monitoring. We will also develop a next-generation ASL denoising technique to further improve ASL CBF SNR and reliability. Given our aging population and the increasing prevalence of AD, performing this project is likely to have significant public health impact. Developing the proposed technique will benefit not only AD study but the general neuroimaging research.",Assessing ASL CBF as a biomarker for early Alzheimer's disease detection and disease

"Molecular Networks Underlying Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease Among APOE E4 Carriers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The e4 allele of the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene has been identified as one of the strongest genetic determinants of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In general, the e4 allele is associated with reductions in neural protection and repair, increasing a carrier’s vulnerability to damage accumulated over his/her lifetime. Nevertheless, while the penetrance of ApoE e4 is relatively high, a significant proportion of e4 carriers will never develop AD. The overall goal of this project is to model interactions across multiple omics networks to identify the biological pathways involved in sporadic AD susceptibility versus resilience among high-risk individuals. The multifactorial nature of AD suggests that it may manifest as a result of complex interactions across the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome. Identifying the central networks involved in AD pathogenesis will require integrative Systems Biology approaches. The proposed research offers a new and innovative way to integrate networks—a dominant feature in biology—across multiple tissues and omics platforms, in order to identify innate and dynamic precursors of resilience to AD, among a high-risk population (e4+). Towards this goal, we will: (1) employ newly developed GWAS-based network analysis, to identify SNP networks that alter the association between ApoE e4 and cognitive decline/dementia; (2) generate DNA methylation and RNA-seq data from brain samples that we will analyze using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (3) generate proteomic data from brain and CSF samples that we will analyze using WGCNA to identify networks associated with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline among ApoE e4+; (4) use advanced integromic network analysis to identify multi-omics and multi-tissue pathways and biological systems involved in AD resilience. The integration of multiple 'omics' data using systems biology will be crucial for unraveling the connections and interactions between various functional levels involved in complex diseases, such as AD. Overall, our proposed research will improve understanding of the complex biology underlying AD susceptibility. These studies have the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets that could inform the development of future pharmacologic interventions aimed at preventing or slowing AD pathogenesis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individuals with the ApoE e4 genotype have a substantially increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The goal of this project is identify underlying biological interactions and networks that explain why some e4 carriers do not develop Alzheimer's disease, despite being high-risk. This research has the potential to uncover novel targets that can lead to the development of effective therapies for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",Molecular Networks Underlying Resilience to

"Learning the Regulatory Code of Alzheimer's Disease Genomes With ageing populations world-wide, neurodegenerative diseases are placing an ever increasing  burden on long- term well-being, healthcare costs and family life. Despite decades of research and  enormous investment, no disease-modifying treatment is available for the most common of these  diseases: Alzheimer’s (AD). The majority of these, to-date unsuccessful, efforts have focused   on one potential cause of AD: amyloid-β aggregation. Combining population-scale data  collection, human genetics and machine learning provides a way forward to uncover and characterize  new causal cellular processes involved in AD. This would provide an array of potential therapeutic  targets, increasing the chance that one will be more easily modulated than the amyloid-β pathway.  AD-specific genomic datasets of unprecedented scale are being actively collected: whole genome  sequencing (WGS) from ~20k individuals, gene expression (RNA-seq) and epigenomics (ATAC-seq,  histone ChIP-seq) from >1000 post-mortem AD brains, single-cell transcriptomes and similar modalities in peripheral and  brain-resident innate immune cells (which we and others have shown to be AD-relevant). Effectively  integrating these diverse data to better understand AD represents a substantial computational  challenge, both in terms of data scale and analysis complexity. This proposal leverages  state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML), combined with human genetic  analyses, to address this challenge. We will train DL models to predict epigenomic signals and  RNA splicing from genomic sequence, enabling in silico mutagenesis to estimate the  functional impact (a “delta score”) of any genetic variant. The delta scores will be used in  genetic analyses that distinguish causal associations: cellular changes that drive AD  pathogenesis rather than downstream/side effects of disease. Delta scores will aid in  associating both rare and common variants to AD. To achieve sufficient power, rare variants must be  aggregated (e.g. for a gene): delta scores will allow filtering out many likely non-functional  (particularly non-coding) variants. Most common variants from AD Genome Wide Association Studies  (GWAS) are simply correlated with the causal variant due to linkage disequilibrium (LD). Delta  scores, combined with trans-ethnic GWAS, will enable estimation of the likely causal variant(s).  These analyses will highlight variants and genes involved in AD. However, genes do not operate in a  vacuum so robust probabilistic ML will be used to learn cell-type and disease-specific gene  regulatory networks from sorted bulk and single-cell RNA-seq. The detected networks will be  integrated with our genetic findings to discover network neighborhoods/pathways especially  enriched in AD variants. Such pathways will be prime candidates for future functional and  therapeutic studies of AD. The goal of this research is to use machine learning algorithms to work out which  genetic differences in the genomes of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients might have  caused their disease. We will do this by learning computational models of how genes are  controlled by genetic sequence and other genes. The proposed study will discover what genes,  pathways and molecular mechanisms are involved in AD, which will provide novel  therapeutic targets for AD patients.",Learning the Regulatory Code of

"Naturalistic Event Representation as a Novel Biomarker of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease By 2060, the number of Americans 65 and older is projected to more than double from 46 million to 98 million, 24% of the total population. With this comes an increased prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which will create significant burden on our society and government. At present, screening tools capable of differentiating healthy aging from AD are most effective a decade or more after the preclinical stage, when potential treatments would be most effective. Thus, discovery of novel and specific tools for assessing the aging brain are of utmost importance. Typical studies of cognitive ability involve recognition of learned objects or simple word associations. However, in real-world situations, the content of an event is segmented from a flow of multimodal information. Segmentation and representation of events is supported by a posterior-medial network (PMN) of brain areas. Critically, this very same brain network features the first regions affected by pathological accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ), a key characteristic of AD. A recent report from an NIA working group defined asymptomatic Aβ accumulation as the earliest indicator of preclinical AD. Given the functional role of the PMN, we propose that this stage of disease may not be truly asymptomatic: subtle functional deficits may be evident if properly probed. To address this, we have developed a naturalistic paradigm to characterize event representation in the brain and subsequent memory. We aim to test the novel hypotheses that the brain’s ability to segment and represent complex events is compromised in preclinical AD, and that the extent of this disruption is predictive of deficient memory for the experienced events. We will acquire functional MRI (fMRI) scans while participants view a video narrative depicting naturalistic scenarios. We will additionally test memory performance related to details of the events depicted in the video both in and out of the scanner. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA) and machine learning analyses of functional MRI (fMRI) data, we will examine differences in the way the brain represents events into advanced aging in participants with and without ‘asymptomatic’ amyloid deposition (status obtained via existing PET scan data). This combination of approaches is highly innovative because current translational measures do not assess memory for rich, dynamic events that make up the majority of real-world experience. This project is expected to significantly improve our understanding of neural and cognitive disruptions that differentiate healthy aging from preclinical AD. By studying how the brain chunks and represents events, and how this relates to memory for those events, we can reveal significant insights into the way AD-related pathology affects day-to-day living. This can provide a mechanistic framework for understanding subtle, subjective memory complaints. The results of this work are anticipated to significantly advance our understanding of memory decline in the earliest possible stages of AD, providing a mechanistic basis for subtle issues that have to date been difficult to assess in the clinic. The ability to parse and represent complex events is a cornerstone of cognition and memory, and is dramatically affected by Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The goal of this project is to use brain imaging and behavioral tests to understand how neural event representations are impacted by preclinical AD compared to healthy aging. The results will help us to understand early differences between healthy aging and AD, and it will help clinicians to develop novel screening tools.",Naturalistic Event Representation as a Novel Biomarker of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease,9912695,R03AG063224,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Amyloid deposition ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Pathology ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Television ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Amyloid beta-Protein ', ' Alzheimer beta-Protein ', "" Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein "", "" Alzheimer's amyloid "", "" Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein "", ' Amyloid Beta-Peptide ', ' Amyloid Protein A4 ', ' Amyloid β ', ' Amyloid β-Peptide ', ' Amyloid β-Protein ', ' Aβ ', ' a beta peptide ', ' abeta ', ' amyloid beta ', ' amyloid-b protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' Measures ', ' improved ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory impairment ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Amyloid Plaques ', ' Neuritic Plaques ', ' amyloid beta plaque ', ' amyloid-b plaque ', ' aβ plaques ', ' cored plaque ', ' diffuse plaque ', ' Senile Plaques ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Stream ', ' Clinic ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Episodic memory ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' movie ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Reporting ', ' Memory Disorders of the Elderly ', ' Age-Related Memory Disorders ', ' memory decline ', ' Memory Loss ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' amyloid beta deposition ', ' amyloid β deposition ', ' aβ deposition ', ' abeta deposition ', ' aged brain ', ' aging brain ', ' abeta aggregation ', ' amyloid beta accumulation ', ' amyloid beta aggregation ', ' amyloid β accumulation ', ' amyloid β aggregation ', ' aβ accumulation ', ' aβ aggregation ', ' abeta accumulation ', ' healthy aging ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' neural patterning ', ' cognitive process ', ' cognitive ability ', ' fMRI scan ', ' functional magnetic resonance imaging scan ', ' functional MRI scan ', "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', ' Alzheimer’s biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2020,157000,0.17093686621448664
"Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease Resubmission 1 R01 AG058687-01 PI: Adriana Seelye, Ph.D. Project Summary. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease and their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and to reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. Project Objectives. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to objectively assess high-level IADL functioning in a new way that will more effectively identify the earliest subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence. The specific aims for this research are: Aim 1 will establish the most robust remotely monitored IADL variables and combinations of variables to discriminate between MCI and intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC using cross-sectional analyses. Aim 2 will determine the discriminatory ability of the new remotely monitored IADL variables compared to available IADL questionnaires to differentiate those with MCI relative to those with intact cognition based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and overall ROC AUC in cross-sectional analyses. Aim 3 will identify and characterize the longitudinal trajectories (slopes) of remotely monitored IADL functioning over time between those with intact cognition and those with MCI using generalized linear mixed effects models, with person-specific IADL distributions and their changes as outcomes. Project Methods. The proposed project will apply innovative computing and ambient sensing technologies directly in participants' home and community environments to objectively assess IADL performance and variability among older adults with and without MCI in multiple clinically relevant functional domains for up to 4 years. Study involvement will also include annual neuropsychological and clinical testing. Machine learning computational approaches will be used to examine a large number of sensor-based IADL candidate variables generated through this study to determine the relative importance of these variables for discriminating between MCI and intact cognition groups, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Project Impact. The approaches used in this study will allow researchers, physicians, and caregivers to proactively identify and monitor increasing risks for deteriorating cognitive function (progressing from normal aging to MCI and from MCI to AD) in a way that is not currently possible, transforming AD prevention trials and significantly reducing the cost and consequences of functional decline in our aging population. Project Narrative Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern that has a profound negative impact on individuals living with the disease, their families, the healthcare system, and the economy. Early identification and accurate assessment of mild cognitive and functional deterioration in older adults with who are at risk for AD will be critical in order to intervene at the earliest stages of the disease and the reduce the cost and consequences of functional declines. The overall goal of this research is to use unobtrusive in-home sensor technologies in the home environment to assess day-to-day functioning in a new way which will more effectively identify the subtle declines in functioning that slowly emerge and ultimately threaten independence.",Unobtrusive remote monitoring to identify and track meaningful change in daily function in community dwelling older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease,9934965,R01AG058687,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Schedule ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Frequencies ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Early identification ', ' Deterioration ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' IADL ', ' instrumental activity of daily living ', ' cognitive change ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' decline in function ', ' decline in functional status ', ' functional status decline ', ' functional decline ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' daily functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' AD prevention ', ' Alzheimer prevention ', ' Alzheimer disease prevention ', ' normal aging ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' Prevention trial ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Data Analytics ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' prodromal AD ', "" prodromal Alzheimer's "", "" prodromal Alzheimer's disease "", "" Alzheimer's diagnosis "", "" Alzheimer's disease diagnosis "", ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,513654,0.10996304691468739
"Development of a reminiscence therapy online platform with machine learning to increase engagement with people living with dementia and their care partners PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or AD-related dementias, and the number of affected individuals is rapidly growing. Symptoms include impaired cognition, resulting in difficulty in performing daily activities and consequent functional dependence on others. The progressive nature of AD and ADRD can result in increasing degrees of care required from professional and family caregivers. Non- pharmacologic interventions positively influence cognition, mood, and other behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and one well-established intervention, life story work (the use of written and oral life histories), serves as an effective technique that can elicit conversation and memories in those with AD and ADRD. However, generating useful life story materials is a time-consuming task for caregivers. To overcome this barrier, LifeBio Inc. is developing a reminiscence therapy platform —LifeBio MemoryTM— with a novel machine-learning-based application that converts speech to text and generates life stories to serve as an interactive tool to cultivate communication between people living with dementia and their family and caregivers. The LifeBio MemoryTM platform application will elicit and store individuals’ stories, photos, and videos and ultimately deliver personalized, point-of-care reminiscence therapy exercises for patients. In preliminary work supporting this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, LifeBio Inc. partnered with the Benjamin Rose Institute on Aging to conduct a pilot study in nursing homes, which showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms among participants in LifeBio Inc.’s intervention and revealed that the majority of participants considered knowledge of their life story to be important for caregivers, while caregivers also reported positive experiences in relation to the impact of the intervention on caregiving. In this project we will: 1) Develop prototype enhancements of the existing LifeBio program and conduct focus group evaluations of these prototypes with 12 existing or former LifeBio users, 20 dementia care professionals familiar with LifeBio and 6 older adults with early-stage dementia to help maintain person-centered practices throughout the research process; 2) Finalize the LifeBio Memory product, which will include the development of a system to automatically record and process individuals’ life stories. 3) Conduct a full-scale fidelity trial of the complete package with 40 care professionals and 160 dementia care dyads across within an assisted living setting. The product of this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, LifeBio Memory™, will be a novel, scalable, and easily implemented solution through which caregivers and healthcare providers can offer person-centered care to people living with AD and AD-related dementias. PROJECT NARRATIVE Non-pharmacological interventions and person-centered care strategies are important elements of care for people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Life story work, which uses written and oral life histories to elicit conversation and memories, is an effective intervention for individuals with dementia; however, because of the time-consuming nature of generating useful life story materials, has not been widely implemented in nursing homes and other care environments. LifeBio Inc. will develop an easy-to-use reminiscence therapy platform —LifeBio MemoryTM— with a novel machine-learning-based application that converts speech to text and generates life stories to serve as an interactive tool to cultivate communication between people living with dementia and their family and caregivers.",Development of a reminiscence therapy online platform with machine learning to increase engagement with people living with dementia and their care partners,10079369,R44AG069566,"['WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' longterm memory ', ' long term memory ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' Oral ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' life history ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' assisted living ', ' assistive living ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' Output ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' Consumption ', ' user-friendly ', ' person centered ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' effective intervention ', ' interactive tool ', ' dementia care ', ' symptomatology ', ' psychological symptom ', ' Exercise Therapy ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' Books ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Empathy ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Moods ', ' Music ', ' Persons ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Qualitative Evaluations ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Quantitative Evaluations ', ' Research ', ' Residential Treatment ', ' residential care ', ' Speech ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family member ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' ']",NIA,LIFEBIO INC,R44,2020,1293690,0.10376443065095031
"GaitIQ: Establishing a Digital Biomarker of Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease Early detection of pre-clinical Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) during the long latent period prior to manifest dementia offers significant opportunities to advance the development of disease modifying interventions and effectively slow the disease’s progression. To achieve this objective, there is a critical need for new technologies that accelerate the development of biomarkers with high sensitivity for underlying AD pathology. A highly promising biomarker for preclinical AD is gait, as subtle gait changes have been correlated with elevated amyloid burden and cortical atrophy. While even simple measures of gait speed predict incident dementia in older adults, current research indicates that preclinical AD pathology is more precisely captured by a combination of 3D kinematic and spatio-temporal measures. A cost-effective mobile application that can be used in clinical trials and by healthcare personnel to capture these parameters efficiently, combined with a validated system to translate the measures to quantifiable AD risk in minutes, would result in a paradigm shift in availability of AD screening for at-risk individuals. GaitIQ™ is an innovative digital health startup company developing an online software-based product that employs computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) to compute clinically accurate spatio-temporal and 3D kinematic data, from a simple video of a person walking. GaitIQTM collaborates with The Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UT Health San Antonio and Southwest Research Institute for this SBIR project. The expected outcome is that advanced kinematic/spatio-temporal measures of gait captured by the GaitIQTM system will reveal a sensitive and specific gait signature with high diagnostic accuracy for pre-clinical AD in a sample of Hispanic older adults. The project will develop and validate the capacity of GaitIQ™ to detect a digital gait biomarker signature that distinguishes between individuals with preclinical AD and controls. The final digital platform will be an easy-to-use, powerful tool to identify and monitor patients with pre-clinical AD using just an iPad/tablet to video their gait and submit it for analysis in the cloud by GaitIQTM sophisticated, proprietary analysis software. Changes in a patient’s walking gait can reveal important early signs of AD decades before cognitive symptoms are observed. GaitIQ™ is a San Antonio-based startup company focused on developing an early-stage digital health software technology that leverages novel machine vision, artificial intelligence (AI), and big data analytics. Our technology can detect subtle gait changes strongly correlated to increased risk for AD using just an iPad or tablet camera in the clinic.",GaitIQ: Establishing a Digital Biomarker of Preclinical

"Multi-Modality Image Data Fusion and Machine Learning Approaches for Personalized Diagnostics and Prognostics of MCI due to AD Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease. The greatest treatment potential lies in early stages before irreversible brain damage occurs. Early treatment requires early detection of the disease. Imaging holds great promise for capturing early signs of AD. This capability can be substantially strengthened by integrating neuroimages of different modalities that characterize brain structure and function from complementary aspects. However, although various machine learning (ML) algorithms have been developed to integrate multi-modality images for diagnosis and prognosis of AD, there is a lack of novel, robust, effective algorithms to address patient-wise missing modalities in the integration. In real clinical data, it is inevitable that some image modalities are unavailable to some patients due to high cost, insurance coverage, and safety constraints. Thus, the existing algorithms may only work for a small portion of patients who have complete modalities. This significantly reduces the access to advanced imaging-based diagnostic systems from the general patient population and in broad clinical settings. Because of the limited clinical utility, it is difficult to commercialize the existing ML algorithms into clinical systems/products, whereas the current imaging-based products on the market focus on single image modalities or image measurement, processing, visualization, and statistical analysis (without advanced ML capabilities). To fill the unmet market niche, this STTR Phase II project will develop the first-ever broadly-applicable clinical decision support system, Multi-neuroimaging for Detecting AD (Mind-AD), which can accommodate varying availability of image modalities across different patients to build classifiers and provide accurate diagnosis and prognosis of AD for each individual at the early MCI stage. Our Phase I has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the Mind-AD system. At Phase II, we propose functional optimization and validation of Mind-AD in three aims. Aim 1 will optimize the accuracy and robustness of the diagnostic/prognostic models by integrating our Phase I IMTL model with efficient PSO feature selection. The integrated IMTL-PSO is very efficient in selecting optimal feature subsets to yield accurate, robust diagnostic/prognostic models especially on independent validation datasets. Aim 2 will develop a novel IMTL- DL (deep learning) model to integrate incomplete multi-modality volumetric images. While IMTL-PSO is based on features defined using anatomical knowledge of the brain, IMTL-DL extracts features in a data-driven manner. Aim 3 will integrate IMTL-PSO and IMTL-DL through decision fusion to best leverage their complementary, joint strength, and validate the resulting Mind-AD system using two independent datasets. Our project is significant because Mind-AD is the first early diagnostic/prognostic system for AD using advanced ML algorithms to integrate incomplete multi-modality image datasets. Mind-AD will facilitate early detection, early intervention, patient selection in drug trials targeting the early stage, and will help achieve these goals in in broad clinical settings due to the capability of accommodating varying availability of image modalities from different patients. The public health relevance of this project is to provide a clinical decision support system, Mind-AD, to facilitate accurate diagnosis and prognosis of AD at the early stage, through novel machine learning integration of multi- modality image datasets with patient-specific missing modalities. Early detection and early intervention bear the greatest potential for combating this devastating disease. Therefore, our system helps address the serious public health concern regarding AD which currently affects over 5.5 million people and incurs over $200 billion health care cost per year in the

"Cutaneous Pathogen-Specific Tissue Resident Memory T Cells in Human Aging Project Summary Several lines of evidence link infections to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This one-year Supplement application focuses on the potential role of HSV-1 infection. About 70% of older adults are HSV-1 infected. The parent R01 concerns the viral pathogen VZV, shingles, and aging, and is eligible for the Supplement as does not concern Alzheimer’s Disease. The Supplement is related to the parent R01 because HSV-1 has a similar pathogenesis, sequence, and antigenic structure to VZV, and also because aging is a risk factor for both shingles and Alzheimer’s Disease. The Supplement Premise is that the fine specificity of T cells recovered from anatomically and clinically relevant specimens from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease subjects can be used as a biomarker probe possible microbial driver of these disorders. Linkages between HSV-1 and AD include epidemiologic association of AD with HSV-1 seropositivity in APOE4(+) persons, detection of HSV-1 from AD tissues, the ability of HSV-1 to trigger amyloidogenesis in vitro, and interactions between HSV-1 cerebral infection, human APOE genotype, and dementia-like phenotypes in murine models. The Investigative team includes experts in HSV-1 T cell biology, single cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCRseq) and TCR bioinformatic analysis, advanced histologic of human nervous system tissue, and the clinical study of Mild Cognitive Impairment subjects. The study is home- based at the University of Washington (UW) including the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), with one domestic and one international collaborative site. Importantly, ongoing NIH grant/subcontract relationships exist between UW and each site and the PI has published multiple recent papers with the Co-Investigators at each site. Aim 1 recovers CSF and matched blood from HSV-1-seropositive persons with MCI and uses wet-lab and TCRseq dry/wet methods to determine if HSV-1-specific T cells are enriched in CSF compared to blood. Aim 2 recovers single T cells from curated AD autopsy tissues from the Netherlands Brain Bank and similarly measures HSV-1 specificity. Together, the Aims leverage the extreme sensitivity and memory characteristics of T cell immunity to examine the hypothesis that HSV-1 is involved in Alzheimer’s Disease Project Narrative Because several lines of evidence indicate that HSV-1 infection may be a cofactor for the development of these disorders, the investigative team proposes use of sensitive detection methods to determine if anatomically relevant specimens such as spinal fluid and brain tissue show evidence of immune responses to HSV-1. The Relevance is that antiviral medications and vaccines may be rational for prevention or even therapy if we can strongly link HSV-1 with the pathogenesis of these disabling conditions",Cutaneous

"Multiscale Resolution and Deep Network Approaches for Deconvolving Different Cell Types in Bulk Tumor using Single-cell Sequencing Data (scDEC) Abstract  Brain tissue is composed of heterogeneous cell populations. Understanding the changes in brain cell type or state composition during neurodegeneration have important implications for future treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). For example, microglia cell development (scRNA-Seq) brain. including poorly type specific gene expression changes occur early in the of AD. Over the past few years, the development and application of single-cell RNA sequencing have revolutionized brain research thus enabling us to study the cellular heterogeneity of the With the advent of scRNA-Seq, we can now identify healthy and diseased brain cell types or states rare cell type or state populations and identify transcriptional alterations within these cell groups. addition to the cellular complexity of the AD, the molecular complexity of the disease also remains understood. In Until now, studies have identified numerous germline genomic variants associated with susceptibility to AD. However, from level identification of somatic example, However, brain healthy and diseased scRNA-Seq data DNA alterations that are distinct the germline, term referred as `brain somatic genomic mosaicism'. Brain somatic variants occur at a low- allele frequency, which could only be detected using single-cell DNA sequencing. C variants For sporadic AD the copy number of APP gene is mosaically increased in single neuron cells. it is challenging to characterize these somatic variants since there is a lack of AD brain or healthy single-cell DNA sequencing data. Therefore, there is a great value in utilizing to investigate somatic mosaicism in single brain cells and brain cells, especially neurons, harbor diverse omprehensive in brain cells will explain the contribution of somatic mosaicism to AD. in the growing number of identify genomic variants that are associated with susceptibility to AD.  In this proposal, we describe a novel deep network approach for deconvolving different cell types or states in bulk AD sample using single-cell RNA sequencing data. Our approach will estimate not only the ratio of cell types or states but also the ratio of somatic clonal mosaicism in AD samples using scRNA-Seq data. We define somatic clonal mosaicism as the groups of cells, i.e. clones, harboring somatic genomic variants such asCNVs, SNPs, or indels. Thesesomatic genomic variants novel multiscale resolution signal processing based algorithm named CaSpER. will be identified from scRNA-Seq data We will then extract using our cell or clone type gene signatures from scRNA-Seq data using a generative deep learning approach called General Adversarial Networks (GANs). used We will also adapt radiogenomics approaches where we correlate image features with cell type ratios. Our proposed approach will lead to major improvements in clinical care to guide the treatment and prognosis of AD. These cell type gene signatures identified from scRNA-Seq data will be later to infer fractions of cell type in bulk AD tissue using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Narrative We propose to develop a novel multiscale resolution and deep net based approaches for deconvolving different cell types in bulk AD cells using single cell RNA sequencing data. Using our algorithm, we will identify novel associations between different cell type contents including immune cell, AD neuron cell and somatic mosaicism.

"Novel Approaches to Identifying and Engaging Disadvantaged Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in Clinical Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite well-documented disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prevalence, incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and mortality, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial/ethnic minorities) are disproportionately under-represented in clinical AD research. Current recruitment methods for AD research predominantly identify patients from outpatient clinics and community settings, or with pre-existing diagnoses. Reliance on these recruitment approaches may create barriers to participation for disadvantaged individuals as they are more likely to lack information about AD services, be undiagnosed and have limited access to outpatient care. Yet, greater enrollment of disadvantaged individuals into AD studies is critically needed to achieve national goals for AD research. Targeted AD screening and tailored recruitment within acute care settings has strong potential to address these gaps, as disadvantaged individuals often rely on these settings to meet their health needs. This K76 proposal is designed to provide Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi, PhD, a geriatric trained nurse and expert in AD symptom management with the training required for success as an independent clinician-scientist focused on improving AD identification to promote greater participation in research and access to effective care and therapies, specifically targeting high-risk disadvantaged populations. The overarching objective of the proposed research is to design screening and recruitment approaches for identifying and engaging disadvantaged AD patients/caregivers and their biological children in research from acute care settings. The proposal consists of validation of an electronic health record (EHR) Phenotype Model for AD using EHR clinical data identified in preliminary studies (Aim 1), and specification of this Model for performance among disadvantaged individuals (Aim 1a). To address recruitment from acute care environments, mixed methods strategies will inform the design of tailored recruitment approaches appropriate to acute care (Aim 2) which will be piloted with 30 AD patients/caregivers to determine their feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact on willingness to enroll in a Trial Registry (Aim 2a). As a junior faculty member at an institution with extensive support for early stage investigators and significant infrastructure in AD disparities and EHR Phenotyping, Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi is in an ideal environment to complete the proposed research and pursue advanced training relevant to her career goals. Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi’s career development plan integrates didactic and practical training, individual mentoring and mentored research activities in the areas of 1) clinical trial design, 2) advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, 3) acute care research, 4) AD health disparities, 5) recruitment and retention of vulnerable populations and 6) leadership. This proposed award addresses fundamental gaps and barriers to improve inclusion of disadvantaged individuals in AD research while affording training and mentored research critical for Dr. Gilmore-Bykovskyi to lead an independent research program in clinical AD research. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Under-representation of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. racial and ethnic minorities) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research is a major barrier to achieving national AD research goals and exacerbates widespread health disparities in AD. The proposed research addresses fundamental barriers to research participation among disadvantaged individuals with AD through the development of novel 1) screening and 2) recruitment approaches within acute care settings, where many disadvantaged individuals routinely seek health care.

"MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION FOR UNBIAS BIOMARKER DISCOVERY FOR AD AND OTHER COMPLEX TRAITS Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia but has no effective prevention or treatment. The brain proteome, ascertained in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have proven to be a rich source of information, reflecting Aβ plaques deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal injury and inflammation, and have helped the enrollment of participants in clinical trials. Still, additional non-invasive and cost-effective biomarkers are critical for the early detection, disease intervention and monitoring. Novel biomarkers may also help identify and characterize the additional aspects of AD, such as rate of progression and age at onset. Although genetic studies have focused on the identification of variants associated with risk through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome and exome sequencing projects, the genetic factors modulating these additional aspects of AD are less investigated. The current proposal focuses on these understudied aspects of disease etiology, namely the role of common and rare genetic variation on quantitative diagnostic and prognostic endophenotypes of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We will develop a unique resource – the proteome ascertained in a plasma, CSF and brain for a large number of samples – that will allow us to leverage unbiased approaches to reveal novel biomarkers and endophenotypes associated with AD and complex traits. We will utilize Mendelian Randomization to identify causal proteins involved in AD and extend our studies to other complex traits. We will use GWAS, exome-chip, whole-exome and whole-genome sequences to identify single variants, genes and pathways associated with plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain protein levels of AD biomarkers. NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with devastating personal, familial, societal and economical burdens, and there is currently no effective means of prevention or treatment. If successful, our research will reveal novel intermediate traits and genetic variants involved in AD and other complex traits, potentially leading to prospective therapeutic targets, and will also provide guidelines for accurate and practical assessments of AD status, which will be invaluable for evaluations of effectiveness of experimental treatments in clinical trials.",MENDELIAN

"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia ABSTRACT The “preclinical” phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation in the absence of major symptoms, can last decades, and potentially holds the key to successful therapeutic strategies. Today there is an urgent need for quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests that can predict clinical progression at the individual level. This project will develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms that will mine high dimensional, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to derive models that yield individual-level clinical predictions in the context of dementia. The developed prognostic models will specifically utilize ubiquitous and affordable data types: structural brain MRI scans, saliva or blood-derived genome-wide sequence data, and demographic variables (age, education, and sex). Prior research has demonstrated that all these variables are strongly associated with clinical decline to dementia, however to date we have no model that can harvest all the predictive information embedded in these high dimensional data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to compute clinical predictions from high- dimensional biomedical data such as clinical scans. Yet, most prior ML methods were developed for applications where the ``prediction’’ task was about concurrent condition (e.g., discriminate cases and controls); and established risk factors (e.g., age), multiple modalities (e.g., genotype and images) and longitudinal data were not fully exploited. This application’s core innovation will be to develop rigorous, flexible, and practical ML methods that can fully exploit multi-modal, longitudinal, and high- dimensional biomedical data to compute prognostic clinical predictions. The proposed project will build on the PI’s strong background in computational modeling and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. We will employ an innovative Bayesian ML framework that offers the flexibility to handle and exploit real-life longitudinal and multi-modal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternative benchmarks for identifying preclinical individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a statistically rigorous approach for discovery, cross-validation, and benchmarking the developed tools. This project will yield freely distributed, documented, and validated software and models for predicting future clinical progression based on whole-genome, longitudinal structural MRI and demographic data. We believe the algorithms and software we develop will yield invaluable tools for stratifying preclinical AD subjects in drug trials, optimizing future therapies, and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. NARRATIVE Emerging technologies allow us to identify clinically healthy subjects harboring Alzheimer’s pathology. While many of these preclinical individuals progress to dementia, sometimes quite quickly, others remain asymptomatic for decades. The proposed project will develop sophisticated data mining algorithms to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on ubiquitous, easy- to-collect, and affordable data modalities:

"A knowledge map to find Alzheimer's disease drugs To stem the rising incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in our aging population, new methods to repurpose and combine drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) are acutely required. This is a challenge, however, because the complex polygenic basis of AD remains opaque, and rational methods to repurpose drugs are in early years, even for well-defined gene targets. To address these problems, we propose new algorithms to integrate data on a very large scale so as to combine evolutionary information and high-throughput experimental observations with the knowledge conveyed by text in the literature. First, to detect disease-relevant genome variations in AD patients, Aim 1 will combine a novel mathematical calculus of mutational landscapes with machine learning, in so doing suggesting primary candidate genes for drug targeting based on signs of mutational selection in cases or controls. Next, to repurpose and combine drugs targeting these genes, Aim 2 will map a large fraction of all that is known about genes, phenotypes, and drugs into a single high-dimensional network that represents their interactions as described in various databases (structured data) and in the literature (unstructured data). The topology of this network will determine the optimal choice of single drug or combination therapy in an approach that can be personalized. Finally, to validate efficacy experimentally, Aim 3 will test both our candidate genes and drugs with state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo screens. Feasibility rests with prior studies on evolution, networks, systems, and text-mining that demonstrate accurate predictions of deleterious mutations and their clinical sequelae and the discovery of drivers of diseases. Broadly, this work will yield proof of principle for a novel quantitative model that integrates fundamental concepts from mathematics and molecular evolution, and for a low resolution but large-scale map of biomedical knowledge in which network notions of distance computed by machine learning identify relevant functional hypothesis that would otherwise be easily overlooked. The result will be a new experimental ability to unravel the genotype-phenotype relationship in Alzheimer's Disease so as to guide drug therapy. Alzheimer's is a devastating disease projected to rise dramatically in our aging population. To develop drugs against it, we propose to train machine learning on the DNA of patients with Alzheimer's to detect genes with abnormal mathematical features in their mutations. Then, we will place these genes in a “map”, which represents a large fraction of biomedical knowledge in a high-dimensional network. The drugs that fall near our genes of interest in this map are our candidates, and experiments will test in cell and mouse models whether they affect the hallmark signs of Alzheimer's.",A knowledge

"Deep Learning with Neuroimaging Genetic Data for Alzheimer's Disease Summary  Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects over 44 million individuals worldwide, and the number is projected to triple by 2050. However, currently there is no cure for AD. This project aims to develop and apply novel statistical methods, especially deep learning, to advance neuroimaging genetics for AD. It involves novel methodological developments in Aims 1-4, cost-effective applications to the large-scale UK Biobank neuroimaging genetic data for AD (Aim 5), and software development (Aim 6). All four Aims for the methods development tackle emerging impor- tant topics in deep learning with their applications to neuroimaging genetics for AD; although the other three Aims deal with independent topics with their own other broad applications, they in turn serve for Aim 1: 1) Aim 1 applies manually searched deep learning models for automatic feature extraction/phenotyping from neuroimages, by which both the statistical power and biological interpretation of subsequent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are expected to be enhanced; 2) Aim 2 employs (automatic) neural architecture search (NAS) to more efﬁciently identify better deep learning models, which are then applied to Aim 1 for enhancing feature extraction/phenotyping and thus boosting the power of GWAS; 3) Aim 3 focuses on explainable deep learning, offering biological insights by localizing and highlighting the most important features extracted by deep learning models that can be used for Aim 1; 4) Aim 4 develops a novel inferential theory for deep learning, which is then applied to rigorously test for the statistical signiﬁcance of any selected/highlighted features used in Aim 1. In Aim 5, these new methods will be applied to the UK Biobank neuroimaging and GWAS data to identify novel genetic loci and neuroimaging features for AD. As a byproduct, we will develop and distribute software implementing the proposed methods in Aim 6. Project Narrative  This proposed research is to develop new statistical estimation and inference methods for deep learning with their applications to neuroimaging genetics for Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is expected to contribute to the elucidation of genetic components and etiology of AD with potential applications to other common diseases, thus facilitating their prevention, early diagnosis and therapeutic development.",Deep Learning with Neuroimaging Genetic Data for Alzheimer's Disease,10088703,R01AG069895,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Atlases ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Genotype ', ' Hand ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Noise ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publishing ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Statistical Computing ', ' statistical process ', ' statistical reasoning ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Pythons ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Entropy ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Proxy ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Documentation ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' genetic association ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' cost ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' combinatorial ', ' endophenotype ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' model building ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep learning ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' neural net architecture ', ' neural network architecture ', ' feature extraction ', ' feature selection ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' genomic locus ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,685871,0.20388055913096975
"Reconstructing the temporal landscape of gene regulation in aging PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The circadian rhythm orchestrates a vast repertoire of biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes with a 24-hour period. A clock circuit, driven by the oscillatory activation and repression of a set of core clock genes, is present in every cell and regulates the expression of nearly half the genome across all tissues. Abundant epi- demiological evidence links circadian regulation to human health. In particular, sleep and circadian disruption is associated with neurodegeneration, where it is thought to be both a consequence and a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). As the most common form of dementia in the elderly, AD is rapidly becoming a public health cri- sis, affecting an estimated 5.5M people in the United States (24M world-wide) and is expected to double over the next 20 years. Addressing this crisis requires a deep understanding of disease mechanisms and the identiﬁcation of diagnostic/therapeutic targets. A wealth of existing transcriptomic data, coupled with the development of sophisticated computational tools for temporal reconstruction and analysis, provide an exciting opportunity to identify dysregulation in oscillatory patterns of gene expression associated with aging and AD.  We propose to develop novel computational strategies to decipher the oscillatory patterns of gene expression using existing untimed transcriptomic datasets; and to apply them to existing data from studies of AD to identify dysregulation in the oscillatory patterns associated with AD. Our methods address a number of analytical chal- lenges, including the need to reconstruct temporal information from untimed samples; ensuring generalizability and accuracy across different transcriptomic proﬁling technologies; addressing the fact that untimed samples may not span the full day; and identifying changes in complex, non-sinusoidal rhythms. Together, these studies will reveal oscillatory patterns of gene expression associated with aging and Alzheimers disease, and will provide innovative new methods for the circadian analysis of untimed data that can be applied to other phenotypes. NARRATIVE The circadian rhythm orchestrates critical physiological functions at the molecular, cell, and organismal levels. While degradation of the circadian rhythm is known to be associated with aging and believed to contribute to Alzheimer's and other age-related diseases, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly characterized. This project aims to develop and apply powerful computational tools to investigate circadian patterns of gene activity in older adults, with the goal of enabling personalized circadian medicine for an aging population.",Reconstructing the temporal landscape of gene regulation in aging,10046159,R01AG068579,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Repression ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' poor sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' Systems Theory ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Shapes ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' circadian abnormality ', ' circadian disruption ', ' circadian disturbance ', ' circadian dysfunction ', ' circadian impairment ', ' Circadian Dysregulation ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Older Population ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' Output ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' reconstruction ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' therapeutic target ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' healthy aging ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' dynamical system ', ' dynamic system ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' circadian ', ' circadian regulation ', ' ']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,378976,0.14629015748295288
"Identification and Characterization of Common Pathways across Alzheimer Disease Genotypes using a Multiomic Approach Alzheimer disease (AD) is a multigenic and multifactorial condition with a common pathological hallmark, deposition of Aβ and tau proteins aggregates in the brain. A few genes have been directly involved in the protein deposition metabolism. Another 24 loci have been identified as risk factors for AD which have shed light into other impaired mechanisms. There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how all these pathways are interrelated towards a same ending phenotype. Omic technologies have been instrumental in complementing our understanding of the pathways involved between disruption of particular loci and final pathology. However, each one of these studies only explains a modest portion of the pathology of AD, whilst complex diseases involve a highly dynamic and interactive system of molecular layers. The central hypothesis is that different molecular layers are interconnected in AD so that the dysregulation of any of these causes the ultimate AD phenotype (Aβ and tau proteins aggregates). Multi-omic analysis can provide an insight into how different molecular dimensions interact with each other, an insight that single omic data cannot provide. Also, there is limited availability of multi-omic data collected on the same group of individuals and tissue. The objective of this project is to identify dysregulated pathways consistent across molecilar layers. In the K99 phase of the award, I plan to generate single-omic profiles (transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic) from brain tissue from highly characterized individuals. I will also leverage existing GWAs data for these individuals to conduct pair-wise integrative analysis to identify common variants that act as genetic regulators (QTL) for the identified dysregulated molecular markers. To conduct these analyses, I will gain training in network and pathway analysis, but also in big data and machine learning methods. During this period, I will also receive training in handling of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSc) and in functional analysis. Preliminary analysis using transcriptomic data have identified AGFG2 gene to be overexpressed across AD etiologies compared to controls. AGFG2 is an astrocyte expressed gene that seems to be involved in Aβ metabolism. During the K99 phase I will examine the role of AGFG2 in iPSC-derived astrocytes from AD patients' carriers of known pathogenic mutations (ADAD). Having acquired this knowledge, during the R00 phase I will explore whether dysregulation of AGFG2 has the same effect in ADAD as in iPSC-derived astrocytes from early onset and late onset AD patients. Finally, I will elevate the pair-wise integration of omic data to a meta-dimensional level. This will allow me to identify molecular signals (transcripts, proteins, metabolites) that are consistent across molecular layers. If successful, this project has the potential to reveal novel insights of AD biology, which will be of interest to the scientific community. In addition, with this award I will develop a translational profile which will be invaluable for establishing me as an independent investigator in the growing field of systems biology. Project Narrative This study will use multi-omic data from brain tissue from Alzheimer disease (AD) cases and healthy individuals to identify biological abnormalities that are consistent across molecular layers which will be validated on iPSc. The results will reveal novel understanding of AD and point to new therapeutic targets.",Identification and Characterization of Common Pathways across Alzheimer Disease Genotypes using a Multiomic Approach,10119596,K99AG061281,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Astrocytes ', ' Astrocytus ', ' Astroglia ', ' astrocytic glia ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Amyloid beta-Protein ', ' Alzheimer beta-Protein ', "" Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein "", "" Alzheimer's amyloid "", "" Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein "", ' Amyloid Beta-Peptide ', ' Amyloid Protein A4 ', ' Amyloid β ', ' Amyloid β-Peptide ', ' Amyloid β-Protein ', ' Aβ ', ' a beta peptide ', ' abeta ', ' amyloid beta ', ' amyloid-b protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' tau Proteins ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' tau ', ' tau factor ', ' τ Proteins ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Molecular Layer ', ' Molecular Layer of the Cerebellar Cortex ', ' Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' brain tissue ', ' late onset alzheimer ', ' Late Onset Alzheimer Disease ', ' interest ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Proteomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' early onset ', ' protein metabolite ', ' disease phenotype ', ' protein aggregate ', ' insoluble aggregate ', ' protein aggregation ', ' Impairment ', ' transcriptomics ', ' amyloid beta deposition ', ' amyloid β deposition ', ' aβ deposition ', ' abeta deposition ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' therapeutic target ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' AD pathology ', "" Alzheimer's pathology "", "" Alzheimer's disease pathology "", ' multiomics ', ' multiple omics ', ' marker identification ', ' biomarker identification ', ' multiple omic data ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' machine learning method ', "" Alzheimer's patient "", "" Alzheimer's disease patient "", ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,54000,0.35921057725884464
"Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer Disease Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias that are associated with major adverse effects on daily function and quality of life, and accelerate time to institutionalization. Of all the NPS, depression is the most frequently observed symptom in people with mild cognitive impairment and early AD. As the disease progresses, agitation, delusions and hallucinations become more common, whereas apathy is the most persistent and frequent NPS throughout all the stages of AD. AD- NPS share some clinical features with serious mental illnesses (SMIs), such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, but whether these conditions share similar aethiopathies is unclear. Given that reliable treatments for NPS in the context of AD and other dementias do not exist, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying NPS in AD and other neuropsychiatric illnesses is a critical next step to identify reliable biomarkers that could lead to novel therapeutics.  There are two overarching goals of this proposal. First, we will identify the molecular mechanisms and neuropathological changes that are associated with the presence of NPS in patients with AD. Second, we will examine if the mechanisms of pathology associated with NPS are shared or distinct among AD and SMIs. More specifically, we propose to build multi-scale integrative models using phenomics and genomics data from 1,264 autopsy cases derived from a single brain bank. The bank includes detailed phenomics data such as well characterized NPS, clinical diagnosis (AD and other neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric traits), severity of cognitive decline and neuropathology for each patient sample. From each case, we will apply innovative approaches that reduce the cost and technical biases associated with conventional methods, and capture gene expression signatures and epigenetic regulatory elements at the single-cell level. Novel deep-learning methods will be applied for the multi-scale integration of neuropathologic changes with genetic markers and functional genomic changes (such as changes in gene expression and enhancer sequences) within specific cell types, to predict various NPS in AD and other neuropsychiatric traits; we refer to these integrative models as genotype- marker-phenotype models. We expect that these models will enable us to assign genotypes and molecular markers to specific NPS within AD and other neuropsychiatric traits at the single-cell level, an unprecedented level of resolution. In addition, we will test the translational potential of the genotype-marker-phenotype models to predict AD-NPS using independent large-scale biobank datasets, in which genotypes and electronic health records are available. Successful completion of the proposed studies will have immediate utility by generating potential biomarkers for NPS diagnosis and prognosis and by providing predictive models for patient stratification in clinical trials. In the longer term, our models will help us create a blueprint for therapeutic strategies and interventions to treat NPS in AD. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are core features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, that contributes to early institutionalization and causes substantial caregiving and caregiver burden. Despite decades of research, reliable treatments for NPS in the context of AD and other dementias have not been found. The proposed studies will generate and integrate high- dimensional phenomics and genomics data in human brain tissue, that will inform us about the molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying NPS in the context of AD and other neuropsychiatric illnesses.",Understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer Disease,10107022,R01AG067025,"[""Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Delusions ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Genetic Enhancer Element ', ' Enhancer Elements ', ' enhancer sequence ', ' genetic enhancer sequence ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Hallucinations ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Restlessness ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Clinical ', ' Therapeutic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Severities ', ' cell type ', ' brain tissue ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' functional genomics ', ' neuropathology ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Molecular ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' daily functioning ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' severe mental illness ', ' caregiving burden ', ' caregiving stress ', ' care giving burden ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' phenomics ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' potential biological marker ', ' potential biomarker ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' phenotypic marker ', ' phenotypic biomarker ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' neuropsychiatric symptom ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep learning ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' ']",NIA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,436643,0.3508316890088063
"Assessing ASL CBF as a biomarker for early Alzheimer's disease detection and disease progression ABSTRACT. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting tens of millions of people. A top research priority in AD is to find a biomarker sensitive to early disease and disease progression because that will likely provide the best opportunities for searching and evaluating effective treatments for this currently incurable brain disease. Human brain relies on cerebral blood flow (CBF) for its energy supply and waste removal. Previous research has indicated that CBF reductions cause neuron inactivity and neurotoxic waste accumulation and subsequently neuron death, which may eventually lead to AD dementia. Measuring CBF and following its longitudinal course may then provide a highly potential biomarker for early AD and its progression. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI is a technique for quantifying CBF without using exogenous tracers. Because it is relatively cheaper and can be repeated many times, it is well suited for longitudinal AD research. Sensitivity of ASL MRI to AD and prodromal AD has been shown in many cross-sectional studies (comparing AD to controls) by other groups and us. But several important questions still remain unanswered including the prediction power of ASL CBF for early AD and AD progression, the longitudinal CBF change patterns, and sex difference of CBF in AD. Addressing those questions needs large size longitudinal data and expertise for analyzing ASL MRI data due to the low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The purpose of this project is to address those open questions by leveraging our extensive expertise on ASL MRI and the accumulating longitudinal ASL data from ADNI (a large ongoing multi-site AD neuroimaging study). The novel information or outcome from this project will include the prediction power of ASL CBF for early AD, CBF change rate when disease progresses or reverts, gender effects in AD and its progression, and a next-generation ASL MRI processing algorithm based on deep-machine learning (DL), and a DL-based AD prediction model. We will first confirm our previous ADNI ASL CBF findings using larger sample and updated methods (not available before). We will then check sensitivity of ASL CBF for tracking and predicting disease progression or cognitive declines. Gender effects on CBF in AD will be explicitly examined, which may reveal a clue for the higher prevalence of AD in females. We will revisit those studies using the DL-based ASL denoising algorithm. Pursuing those aims will help establishing ASL CBF as an AD biomarker and provide a versatile AD prediction model using ASL CBF as well as other valuable biomarkers provided in ADNI. Developing and sharing the DL ASL MRI denoising method will benefit not only AD research but also the various scientific projects based on ASL MRI. The feasibility of this innovative but clinically important project is ensured by our decades of experience and the substantial pilot investigations in each aspect of the study, including ASL MRI, AD ASL study, and machine learning. Identifying biomarkers sensitive to early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its progression is central to AD studies. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) will be measured using arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI and assessed for early AD detection and progression monitoring. We will also develop a next-generation ASL denoising technique to further improve ASL CBF SNR and reliability. Given our aging population and the increasing prevalence of AD, performing this project is likely to have significant public health impact. Developing the proposed technique will benefit not only AD study but the general neuroimaging research.",Assessing ASL CBF as a biomarker for early Alzheimer's disease detection and disease

"Leveraging Existing Data and Analytic Methods for Health Disparities Research Related to Aging and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) Abstract Two of a series of in-person workshops in 2020-2022 will be hosted at Duke to provide new knowledge on how existing and recently developed analytic methods can be used for detailed population and clinical data analysis in order to make progress in understanding the causes and mechanisms of health-related disparities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), related dementias (ADRD), and other prominent age-related diseases. The long- term goal of the series is to provide a resource focused on diffusing methodological know-how in terms of demonstrating the capabilities of newly developed methodologies, expanding on the rigor and range of application of well-established and familiar methods, promoting correct use of big health data both from a methodological and ethical prospective as well as providing a forum for experts and newcomers interested in health disparities and age-related diseases to discuss their ideas and promote their research. The pilot Duke- NIA workshop of the series held in February 2019 at Duke University was successful in drawing broad scientific interest to the topic and generated the background for the current proposal. The focus of the first workshop (planned in Winter 2020/2021) will be on demonstrating how studies using established administrative health data resources such as the Medicare claims database combined with innovative analytic approaches such as partitioning analyses, time-series based methods of projection/forecasting, and stochastic process models can be used to uncover previously overlooked and/or understudied aspects in this area of research. Specific topics to be discussed will include: i) disparities in risks and survival of AD/ADRD and other age- related diseases; ii) forecasting approaches for prevalence and mortality of AD/ADRD and other age-related diseases; iii) analysis of Medicare and other administrative claim-based data. The focus of the second workshop (planned in Winter 2021/2022) will extend this to include the health records data routinely collected in hospitals or University medical centers (e.g., the Duke Clinical Data Warehouse) and demonstrate how well- established and new analytic methods can be rigorously applied to such data to contribute to identifying the causes of persistent health disparities between specific groups of the U.S. population and narrowly defined patient strata. Specific topics will be expanded to include: i) analytic approaches to identify and quantify the contribution of treatment-related and medical care access-related factors to disparities in outcomes of AD/ADRD and other age-related diseases; ii) comorbidity, multimorbidity, treatment-related, social and genetic factors as sources of disparities in health outcomes of AD/ADRD and other age-related diseases; iii) forecasting of health outcomes and approaches for analyses of potential health interventions. The proceedings will be streamed live on the workshop website and presentations will be freely available in text and video form after the fact. Narrative Our objective is to host two in-person workshops in 2020-2021, in which research findings and evidence-based information and analytic tools for analyses of health-related disparities in Alzheimer’s disease, related dementias and other prominent age-related diseases are discussed. Specific Aims to be addressed in this project will be focused on increased collaboration and partnership in an interdisciplinary research community focused on analytic methods for large-scale population and clinic-related data, constructing a bridge between independent research subgroups, and the identification of ways to achieve synergistic effects in multidisciplinary research by combining innovative approaches developed across different research groups. Ultimately, our long-term goal is to diffuse the active use of advanced analytic methods for analyses of existing big health population datasets in health disparity research.",Leveraging Existing Data and Analytic Methods for Health Disparities Research Related to Aging and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD),10070960,R13AG069381,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stochastic Processes ', ' stochastic method ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' news ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Stream ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' Participant ', ' health record ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' analytical tool ', ' evidence base ', ' Medicare claim ', ' population health ', ' clinical data repository ', ' clinical data warehouse ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' health data ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Time trend ', ' data resource ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data repository ', ' data warehouse ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R13,2020,50000,0.10395882723860587
"Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate is an epileptologist and neuroscientist at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Medical School, whose long-term career goal is to become an independent- ly funded translational investigator with expertise at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases. Patients with neurodegenerative diseases are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and patients with epilepsy often suffer from cognitive co-morbidities. The ability to translate the clinical experience, research tools, and intellectual framework from the field of epilepsy to that of the neurodegenerative diseases, and vice versa, could be a powerful approach to studying both processes. During the proposed training period, the candidate will combine her prior training in epilepsy, EEG signal processing, and machine learning, with newly acquired skills in neuroimaging (functional MRI), biostatistics, and additional clinical exposure to patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Under the mentorship of Dr. Sydney Cash, an expert in epilepsy and neurophysiologic signal processing, and the co-mentorship of Dr. Reisa Sperling, an expert in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and neuroimaging approaches, the candidate proposes to: 1) Delineate the spectrum of epileptiform activity in early stages of AD and develop computa- tional tools to identify this activity; 2) Establish the pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie epileptiform activity in AD; and 3) Determine how epileptiform abnormalities are associated with cognitive trajectories in patients with early stage AD. Visual and computational analysis of 24- hour scalp EEGs will be integrated with resting-state and task-based fMRI measurements, amy- loid PET imaging, and longitudinal cognitive testing from subjects with AD, to develop a com- prehensive understanding of the role of epileptiform abnormalities in early stages of AD. In addi- tion to the research proposed, the candidate’s career development plan entails rigorous coursework and seminars, practical hands-on experience, and close guidance from a board of academic advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow the candidate to establish a clinical and research niche at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases, and to develop a comprehensive toolbox with which to probe human brain function from the standpoint of neurophysiology, structure, connectivity, and tar- geted pathology. Collectively, these will form the foundation for a successful career as an inde- pendent investigator pursuing important clinical and translational research projects to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, or both. Project Narrative People with Alzheimer’s disease are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and people with epilepsy commonly suffer from impairments in memory and cognition. Our goals are to better understand the interplay between epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease, and to determine whether epileptiform activity may be a treatable contributor to cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s disease. This has important public health implications, as according to the Alzheimer’s Association, a treatment that slows the rate of progression of Alzheimer’s disease by five-fold would reduce the number of people with severe Alzheimer’s disease from 6.5 million to 1.2 million and reduce Medicare costs by 50% by the year 2050.",Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's

"The Longitudinal Course O\F Imaging Biomarkers in People At RISK of AD The goal of this ongoing R01 is to chart the progression of pathobiologic markers of presymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and their effect on neural function and cognition in a late-middle-aged cohort enriched with risk for AD. There is an appreciable gap in knowledge about the temporal disease course in this age range that this ongoing project has been directly addressing with serial multimodal imaging including amyloid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection, and serial cognitive measurement. In the next funding cycle we will add a new positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technique sensitive to fibrillar tau [F-18]THK5351 indexing neurofibrillary pathology. In the prior funding period we recruited 179 individuals from a registry of 1,545 people at risk for AD known as WRAP (Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention). We found that [C-11]PIB amyloid burden is detectable in 20% of people with parental history of AD at a mean age of 60. Baseline amyloid is more extensive in the presence of higher CSF total tau levels, and 2-year increases in PiB amyloid are significantly predicted by higher baseline CSF tau. The hypothesis for this renewal is that tau- related neurofibrillar pathology begins early (in accord with the neuropathology literature) in people at AD risk and its strategic spatial burden explains changes in amyloid, neural function and cognitive decline. Aim 1: To test the premise that amyloid burden is necessary but not sufficient to evoke preclinical cognitive change. We will examine effects of longitudinal amyloid and tau change on episodic memory trajectories over time in 235 at risk individuals including all subjects we previously enrolled and follow them over 2 years with advanced multimodal imaging and CSF. Aim 2: To assess the effects of tau and amyloid imaging on MRI and CSF indicators of neural injury and function. Aim 3: To develop a multimodal disease marker to maximize efficiency of clinical trials in preclinical AD. Following our work in creating tools for efficient clinical trials in MCI, we will extend these concepts to the pre-MCI phase of disease utilizing deep learning architectures with tau, amyloid and structural imaging inputs. We will also examine change over time in tau, amyloid and cognition as outcomes. As any of these features considered singularly may be affected by age, and as amyloid and tau may be `necessary but not sufficient' by themselves, a derived multimodal marker may have eventual clinical utility in enriching prevention trials with those most likely to progress, and increasing power to detect change attributable to preclinical interventions. Significance: Relative tau and amyloid imaging profiles have not been empirically established in the presymptomatic time frame and this information is urgently needed to identify incipient disease. No comparable studies exist regarding the evolution of tau and amyloid signal in the critical late-middle-age time frame of preclinical AD. This ongoing project represents a unique opportunity to examine the earliest determinants of AD progression, when treatments may be most meaningful. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE/ NARRATIVE Identifying the earliest neuropathological features of AD including tau and amyloid pathology will improve early detection and inform clinical trials in the presymptomatic time frame. This project will examine these features with advanced imaging methods in a cohort at risk for AD who are largely asymptomatic. An outgrowth of the project will be information about the rate of change in AD pathology which can help us plan clinical trials in this population using derived outcomes about the brain itself, thereby reducing the number of subjects needed in a trial and increasing sensitivity to detecting change.",The Longitudinal Course O\F Imaging Biomarkers in People At RISK of AD,9919506,R01AG021155,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' brain blood flow ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Pathology ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' Amyloid beta-Protein ', ' Alzheimer beta-Protein ', "" Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein "", "" Alzheimer's amyloid "", "" Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein "", ' Amyloid Beta-Peptide ', ' Amyloid Protein A4 ', ' Amyloid β ', ' Amyloid β-Peptide ', ' Amyloid β-Protein ', ' Aβ ', ' a beta peptide ', ' abeta ', ' amyloid beta ', ' amyloid-b protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Neurofibrillary Tangles ', ' neurofibrillary degeneration ', ' neurofibrillary lesion ', ' neurofibrillary pathology ', ' tangle ', ' tau Proteins ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' tau ', ' tau factor ', ' τ Proteins ', ' neural injury ', ' nerve injury ', ' Entorhinal Area ', ' entorhinal cortex ', ' Hippocampal Formation ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Semantic memory ', ' interest ', ' Episodic memory ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology -

"Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center 1. SUMMARY (Overall) The National Alzheimer's Project Act establishes an integrated national plan to overcome Alzheimer's disease (AD); develop treatments to prevent, halt, or reverse the course of AD; improve the early diagnosis of AD; and decrease disparities in AD for ethnic and racial minority populations at higher risk for AD. In this context, AD is intended to encompass AD-related dementias, including dementia with Lewy bodies. In support of the goals and research milestones of the National Alzheimer's Project Act, the mission of the Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) is to serve as a shared resource to facilitate and enhance research on AD and the spectrum of cognitive impairment associated with Lewy body (LB) pathology. We follow a strategy of deep phenotyping, believing that critical answers emerge more readily when investigators are able to delve deeply within and across multiple levels of participant data. Healthy adults without cognitive or motor impairment serve both as a comparison (control) population and as a preclinical population in which mechanisms of cognitive aging and clinical transition can be studied. People with Parkinson's disease without cognitive impairment also serve as comparators and as an at-risk transitional population for the development of cognitive impairment linked to LB pathology. ADRC resources will provide investigators with unique opportunities for the parallel study of these two neurodegenerative disorders, enabling insights into pathogenesis, preclinical diagnosis, transitions, resistance and resilience, and therapeutic approaches. Aims of the Stanford ADRC are to (1) provide an administrative structure that advances the mission of the center; (2) develop and maintain human resources for studies of the AD spectrum and the LB spectrum of cognitive impairment, as well as cognitive aging; (3) make available well-characterized brain tissues, brain-derived biospecimens, and quantitative molecular data derived from high-content imaging of brain tissues; (4) make available participant biospecimens and high-content biospecimen data; (5) provide structural, functional, and molecular neuroimaging biomarkers in support of research on AD-spectrum cognitive impairment, LB-spectrum cognitive impairment, and cognitive aging; (6) provide for the management of Stanford ADRC data, prepare research datasets, provide high-level biostatistical consultation for ADRC investigators, and support research on big data using tools from biostatistics, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence; (7) with our community partners, provide respectful, culturally sensitive outreach and provide opportunities for education, training, and research participation for healthy adults, people with AD-spectrum and LB-spectrum disorders, and their families. Stanford ADRC outreach and community engagement extends particularly to urban Hispanic/Latino older adults, an important Bay Area population, which is under-represented in AD-related research; and (8) support the training of investigators and future leaders in the field of AD and related dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Overall) The Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center supports the National Alzheimer's Project Act by serving as a shared resource to promote research on Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment linked to Lewy body changes in the brain, and cognitive aging.",Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center,9922029,P30AG066515,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', '

"Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, affecting 1 in 8 individuals over 65 years old in the US. Within AD, approximately 40-60% individuals are affected by psychotic symptoms (AD+P), which are associated with more rapid cognitive decline, greater disability, mortality and caregiver burden, resulting in a disproportionately large disease burden. Recent studies indicate a genetic basis for AD+P risk, but the molecular basis of AD+P remains largely uncharacterized, hindering the search for appropriate treatments and novel therapeutics. In this proposal, we seek to systematically dissect the mechanistic basis of AD+P by systematic generation, integration, and experimental dissection of transcriptional and epigenomic phenotypes across two brain regions and four cell types. (1) We profile single-cell RNA-seq and cell-type specific H3K27ac ChIP-seq across 192 post-mortem brain samples, each in two regions across AD patients with psychosis, AD patients with no psychosis, schizophrenia patients with no AD, and control individuals. (2) We integrate the resulting datasets with genetic information and GWAS data to predict driver genes, regions, variants, and pathways underlying AD+P using state-of-the-art machine learning methods for causality, mediation analysis, and genetic Bayesian fine- mapping. (3) We use our computational predictions to guide a systematic dissection of the molecular underpinnings of AD+P using a modular and programmable CRISPR-Cas9 methodology in iPSC lines to modulate regulatory elements, genes and alleles, and measure the resulting molecular and cellular phenotypes in cell-autonomous and non-autonomous phenotypes. If successful, this ambitious proposal has the potential to provide the first mechanistic insights on the development of psychotic symptoms in AD+P and/or P-AD, reveal functional risk variants and target genes for therapeutic intervention that will likely influence clinical management in order to alleviate the personal and societal burden associated with these disorders.

"Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a growing epidemic, and potential treatments are unlikely to be effective unless deployed during the earliest stages of AD, prior to cognitive symptoms. Currently there are no inexpensive, non-invasive biomarkers for effective AD screening necessary for early recognition and treatment on a broad scale. Sleep is abnormal in preclinical AD, even prior to cognitive symptoms, and disrupted sleep may in turn accelerate AD pathological mechanisms. Electroencephalography (EEG) directly measures brain function, and the stereotyped nature of sleep EEG offers a particularly rich opportunity to identify biomarkers of brain dysfunction due to AD. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that sleep-wake brain mechanisms are abnormal very early in AD, and can be detected via subtle but distinct sleep and EEG changes. The objective is to develop sleep and EEG biomarkers of AD, to enable non-invasive and inexpensive screening on a large scale, through the following specific aims.  Aim 1) Identify sleep-wake patterns across the 24-hour day characteristic of AD pathology. Ambulatory sleep-EEG data will be recorded over the 24-hour period in the home setting from a large, diverse, community-based cohort, with the hypothesis that increased sleep-wake transitions over the 24-hour day are characteristic of preclinical-to-mild AD. Aim 2) Assess slow wave integrity measures as biomarkers of AD pathology. EEG abnormalities of slow wave sleep are particularly associated with elevated amyloid-β levels and plaques. Novel analytic techniques will extract bihemispheric slow wave coherence, slow wave velocity, and slow wave intradaily ratio from EEG data collected during sleep and wake. The hypothesis is that amyloid plaques present in early AD will reduce slow wave integrity by all three measures. Aim 3) Determine the EEG signature of AD using machine learning. Machine learning techniques will be applied to EEG from a full attended overnight polysomnogram, to identify a “signature” of AD pathology. The goal is to identify a “signature” that can be detected with spatially limited EEG data that could be collected at home.  The expected outcome of these aims is to identify sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD that can be detected noninvasively and inexpensively at home. The impact of our work will be the ability to screen large populations easily for AD pathology, so that affected individuals can be identified and treated. Moreover, sleep-EEG biomarkers could be used to track disease progression and treatment response in clinical trials for AD. Lastly, since sleep disturbance has a direct effect on AD pathology, by identifying sleep-EEG changes very early in the pathological process, we may be able to intervene, improve sleep, and potentially change the trajectory of AD.  ! Project Narrative Combating the looming crisis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) will require identifying and treating individuals with AD even before cognitive symptoms appear. The proposed project will develop sleep-EEG biomarkers of AD in a large, diverse, community-based cohort, which can be used for inexpensive, non-invasive screening for AD on a broad scale. This project will enable large-scale screening and treatment of early AD, use of sleep-EEG theranostic biomarkers for clinical and drug-development purposes, and intervention for sleep disturbances to potentially change the trajectory of AD.",Sleep and Electroencephalography Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease,9932299,R01AG059507,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Amyloid deposition ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Pathologic Processes ', ' Pathological Processes ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' poor sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' Spinal Puncture ', ' Lumbar Puncture ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Amyloid beta-Protein ', ' Alzheimer beta-Protein ', "" Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein "", "" Alzheimer's amyloid "", "" Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein "", ' Amyloid Beta-Peptide ', ' Amyloid Protein A4 ', ' Amyloid β ', ' Amyloid β-Peptide ', ' Amyloid β-Protein ', ' Aβ ', ' a beta peptide ', ' abeta ', ' amyloid beta ', ' amyloid-b protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' Measures ', ' tau Proteins ', ' MT-bound tau ', ' microtubule bound tau ', ' microtubule-bound tau ', ' tau ', ' tau factor ', ' τ Proteins ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Delta Wave ', ' Delta Wave sleep ', ' Slow-Wave Sleep ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Staging ', ' Amyloid Plaques ', ' Neuritic Plaques ', ' amyloid beta plaque ', ' amyloid-b plaque ', ' aβ plaques ', ' cored plaque ', ' diffuse plaque ', ' Senile Plaques ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Hour ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Cognitive Manifestations ', ' Cognitive Symptoms ', ' Neurobehavioral Signs and Symptoms ', ' neurobehavioral symptom ', ' Neurobehavioral Manifestations ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' sleep diseases ', ' sleep dysfunction ', ' sleep dysregulation ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Napping ', ' response ', ' sleep onset ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Drug Testing/Development ', ' Clinical Drug Development ', ' Collection ', ' Scheme ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' amyloid imaging ', ' Alzheimer screening ', ' Alzheimer disease screening ', ' combat ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' theranostics ', ' screening ', ' AD pathology ', "" Alzheimer's pathology "", "" Alzheimer's disease pathology "", ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' dysfunctional brain ', ' brain dysfunction ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' quality of sleep ', ' sleep quality ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', ' Alzheimer’s biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', ' sleep pattern ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,418014,0.2867538612344037
"Advancing methods for structural connectome acquisition and estimation in older adults Abstract Diffusion MRI (dMRI) plays critical roles in understanding the neural underpinnings in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Obtaining high quality image with high spatial and q-space resolutions requires prolonged data acquisition, which leads increased mental stress and higher risk of motion artifacts. Acquisition time is a particularly important issue in clinical dMRI in AD and at-risk subjects. But shortening data acquisition time through reducing image resolution will reduce the ability to estimate white matter tracts and degenerate the statistical power. In-plane acceleration (IPA), and simultaneous multislice (SMS), are potential solutions to balance imaging quality and acquisition time. However, IPA and SMS have important limitations, as they require reconstruction methods that introduce noise. The literature studying the impacts of acceleration on dMRI and dMRI-based structural connectome analysis is very limited. Some important questions remain open, including how IPA and SMS affect structural connectome estimation and whether we can further shorten the acquisition time without sacrificing image quality. In this study, we will collect and analyze repeated scans from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, a group at high risk for AD, and age-matched controls. A set of novel statistical methods and toolboxes will be developed to improve both dMRI image reconstruction and connectome estimation and analysis under acceleration. The collected data will be made publicly available. The project has three specific aims: (1) Determine the impact of accelerated imaging on structural connectome (SC) analysis in MCI subjects and age-matched controls. Subjects will have repeated scans under identical acquisition protocols. We will conduct quantitative assessments of reproducibility and discriminative ability of white matter structure and SC. (2) Machine learning reconstruction methods for reducing noise in accelerated dMRI. We will develop machine learning methods to improve vendor-implemented approaches to image reconstruction of k-space data to reduce noise and allow faster acquisition. (3) Develop novel methods for SC estimation and analysis in older adults. Utilizing the output from Aim 2, we will develop novel approaches that can better estimate and analyze SC for older adults. The methodologies developed in this project will facilitate the development of fast and high-quality dMRI acquisition and SC analysis and thus facilitate the development of early imaging biomarkers for AD. PROJECT NARRATIVE We aim to understand how accelerated imaging impacts dMRI data analysis in subjects at-risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We develop new machine learning methods for image reconstruction to overcome the drawbacks of accelerated acquisition. We develop robust structural connectome analysis methods for improved reproducibility. The data and algorithms generated in this study could lead to new practices in clinical neuroimaging of Alzheimer's disease (AD), improve our understanding of AD, and allow the development of new early biomarkers.",Advancing methods for structural connectome acquisition and estimation in older adults,9952875,R21AG066970,"['Acceleration ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Extravasation ', ' Leakage ', ' Spillage ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' image reconstruction ', ' image construction ', ' image generation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motion ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Vendor ', ' Measures ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Fiber ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) ', ' DWI-MRI ', ' Diffusion MRI ', ' Diffusion Weighted MRI ', ' Diffusion weighted imaging ', ' Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' dMRI ', ' diffusion tensor imaging ', ' Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' data acquisition ', ' data space ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' cognitive control ', ' healthy aging ', ' high risk ', ' high reward ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' connectome ', "" Alzheimer's disease biological marker "", ' Alzheimer’s biological marker ', ' Alzheimer’s biomarker ', ' Alzheimer’s disease biomarker ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R21,2020,438448,0.14371430927080817

"National Cohort Studies of Alzheimer's Disease, Related Dementias and Air Pollution Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, where currently 5.8 million people are living with AD dementias, and this number is projected to almost triple to 13.8 million by 2050. In addition AD and related dementias (AD/ADRD) healthcare costs for people ≥65 years were an estimated $277 billion in 2018. Although putative risk and protective factors have been identified, published studies have been unable to identify how to prevent and mitigate disease progression and who is most vulnerable mostly because the existing studies are based on small sample size and lack statistical power to disentangle the effects of different factors. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (a ubiquitous yet modifiable exposure dangerous to the aging brain) has been associated with decreased cognitive function, faster cognitive decline, dementia, AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Toxicological and human studies provide evidence of an association between air pollution and neurodegeneration, highlighting potential biological pathways that include systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. In response to PAR-17-054, our goal is to leverage massive nationwide datasets (Medicare and Medicaid), coupled with advanced statistical methods, to overcome the limitations of existing studies and clarify risk and protective factors for AD/ADRD. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will conduct national epidemiological studies using Medicare and Medicaid claims for the period 2000-2021 for the continental US, to estimate the association between exposure to air pollution and the time to the first AD/ADRD hospitalization. Among enrollees that have been hospitalized for AD/ADRD or MCI we will assess whether air pollution exposure increases risk of mortality, and/or accelerates re-hospitalization for AD/ADRD. In Aim 2 we will apply machine learning methods to identify co-occurrence of individual-level (previous hospitalizations, race, age, and sex), environmental (weather, green space, and noise), and SES risk (or protective) factors to determine which population subgroups are most/least at risk for AD/ADRD hospitalization and progression following air pollution exposure. In Aim 3 we will develop methods to overcome statistical challenges including (1) disentangle the effects of air pollution exposure from other confounding factors by leveraging approaches for causal inference, and (2) correct for potential outcome misclassification. We will conduct side-by-side epidemiological analyses using traditional methods (e.g. regression) and causal inference and machine learning approaches to understand which statistical challenges require more sophisticated approaches. To ensure transparency and reproducibility, we will provide peer-reviewed open-source software so other investigators may implement our methods. In summary the results of this proposal will characterize the link between air pollution exposure and AD/ADRD hospitalization and progression, will identify the multiple modifiable risk and protective factors that determine vulnerability in AD/ADRD, and provide the foundation for implementable actions to prevent and reduce this enormous health burden. This project will leverage data on two cohorts (Medicaid and Medicare enrollees) to characterize the impact of air pollution on risk for and progression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD), and identify the complex interactions of individual-level, environmental and societal factors that lead to increased vulnerability in AD/ADRD. We will develop innovative, transparent, and reproducible methods to address current statistical challenges including outcome misclassification. We will determine the impact of multiple inter-related environmental protective and risk factors to address the multi-factorial AD/ADRD health burden.","National Cohort Studies of Alzheimer's Disease, Related Dementias and Air Pollution",9942956,R01AG066793,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Air Pollution ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Neuroglia ', ' Glia ', ' Glial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Neuroglial Cells ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Nonneuronal cell ', ' nerve cement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Noise ', ' Ozone ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Toxicology ', ' United States ', ' Weather ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' cohort ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Societal Factors ', ' Update ', ' Pathologic ', ' sex ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' nano particle ', ' nano-sized particle ', ' nanosized particle ', ' nanoparticle ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' modifiable risk ', ' open source ', ' aged brain ', ' aging brain ', ' high risk ', ' Medicare claim ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' greenspace ', ' Green space ', ' PM2.5 ', ' fine particulate matter ', ' fine particles ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' protective factors ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2020,802617,0.09540940202093241
