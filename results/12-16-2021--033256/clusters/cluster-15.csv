BIOLOGICAL MONITORING FOR EXPOSURE TO COMPLEX MIXTURES The proposed work will investigate the patterns of chemical metabolites in the urine of people who have been exposed to chemical mixtures.  The short term objective of this work is to develop methods for measuring exposure to complex mixtures.  The work will involve the measurement of metabolites in urine with the aid of pattern recognition techniques.  The results of pattern recognition will then be used in the quantitation of exposure.  The long term objective of this work is the reduction of occupational and environmental disease by the improved identification and management of chemical exposure.  ,BIOLOGICAL MONITORING FOR EXPOSURE TO COMPLEX MIXTURES,3431163,R03OH002555,"['gas chromatography ', ' industry ', ' occupational hazard ', ' chemical carcinogen ', ' metabolism ', ' biohazard control ', ' halobiphenyl /halotriphenyl compound ', ' environmental contamination ', ' dosage ', ' chronic disease /disorder ', ' acute disease /disorder ', ' artificial intelligence ', ' urinalysis ', ' atomic absorption spectrometry ', ' clinical biomedical equipment ', ' ']",NIOSH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R03,1988,19126,0.01890228482363026
"KNOWLEDGE ELICITATION FOR DEVELOPMENTAL RISK ASSESSMENT DESCRIPTION:  (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract) The overall stated goal of this work is to advance the knowledge in the area of human risk assessment for developmental toxicants.  The specific objective for this application is to develop a rule-based expert system for the hazard characterization and exposure estimation steps in the human risk assessment process.  The purpose of such a system would be to assist individual counsellors in the human risk assessment area in their decision making process as they advise patients about developmental risks potentially incurred.  The developed system will then be tested prospectively using scenarios of patient environmental and occupational exposure to compare its accuracy with that of nationally recognized human risk assessment experts. The primary method to be used for knowledge elicitation will be interview of the expert by a knowledge engineer.  The ""rules-of thumb"" derived from multiple national experts will be submitted to a delphi process to gain convergence or divergence on the specific rules.  These rules will then be converted to a form suitable for knowledge representation in a computer program and one or more expert system models (as suggested by the need to test divergent rules) will be developed.  Experts will be asked to characterize the hazard dose-response, mechanism of action, etc.) for known developmental toxicants and to estimate the hazard exposure for a set of predetermined patient exposure scenarios.  Their performance will be compared with that of the computer system (and its programmed variations) to determine sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value.

"VIRTUAL REALITY EXPOSURE THERAPY FOR VETERANS WITH PTSD Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most disabling               psychopathological conditions affecting the veteran population.                  Approximately 15.2% of the men and 8.5% of the women stationed in                Vietnam were found to be suffering from PTSD 15 or more years after              their service. In the Atlanta metropolitan area, some 9000 Vietnam               veterans suffer from complete or partial PTSD. The psychological,                social, occupational and economic consequences of the disorder for               patients and their families are devastating. No therapeutic approach             has proven to be consistently effective in the management of combat-             related PTSD. The present proposal intends to exploit the potential              therapeutic effectiveness of recent advances in computer and display             technology referred to as Virtual Reality. Virtual reality exposure              (VRE) takes place in an immersive, computer-driven environment.                  Patients would be exposed to virtual Huey helicopters flying them over           the jungles of Vietnam.  They will be encouraged to relive their                 traumatic memories, much as in standard exposure therapy, but immersed           in Vietnam stimuli. Ultimate control is possible in the virtual                  environment, changing levels of intensity of exposure instantly. The             proposed project aims to develop virtual reality exposure therapy for            Vietnam veterans with PTSD, revise and perfect the treatment,                    construct a treatment manual, and gather preliminary evidence of its             efficacy in a small group design. A series of five case studies will             be run to develop and revise the treatment. Following this, Vietnam              veterans (n=40) with current DSM-IV PTSD diagnoses will be randomly              assigned to VRE or a wait-list control. Treatment will be delivered              in nine 60-minute individual sessions conducted over 5 weeks.

"TOOL TO ADJUST FOR SOURCE DECAY IN VACULAR IRRADIATION In the US, almost 400,000 patients annually receive balloon angioplasty          to improve arterial blood flow.  About 40 percent of these procedures            are unsuccessful because of restenosis, which is estimated to cost the           US health care system approximately 0.8-2 billion dollars annually.              Endo-vascular irradiation is a new and innovative approach offering the          potential of effective restenosis prevention.                                                                                                                     Almost all the used/proposed radionuclides have short radioactive half-          lives so that, during the useful life of the source, exposure times must         be continuously extended because of the decreasing source activity.              Since the exposure times are comparable to the half-time of sublethal            damage repair (T1/2), the biological effect of a given dose will vary            significantly over the practical lifetime of the source.                                                                                                          The goal is to produce a reliable user-friendly software tool allowing           the physician to find the optimal way to adjust for a given reduction            in the activity (and therefore the dose rate) of the source, so that the         biological effect will remain unchanged. The basic information required          is the T1/2 of the target cells, together with the other relevant                radiobiological response parameter (alpha/beta).  In Phase I, these will         be determined for one coronary artery smooth muscle cell line of human           origin, and a pilot computer program will be written and assessed, to            adjust exposure times to obtain a constant biologically effective dose           as the radioactive source decays and treatment times vary.                                                                                                        PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION                                                  Restenosis costs the US health care system approximately 0.8-2 billion           dollars/yr.  Vascular irradiation is a new technique potentially                 offering effective restenosis prevention, and is likely to have                  widespread application.  Because the radioactive sources used decay over         their useful lifetime, a flexible tool giving biologically-based                 adjustments in the dose prescription for changes in dose rate will be            essential.

"Neural network model of noise-induced hearing loss DESCRIPTION:  The objective of the proposed work is to develop a prediction model using radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) that will predict the auditory consequences of excessive noise exposure in a chinchilla model. The RBFNN model will be fed training data from our existing database (chinchilla) consisting of noise exposure metrics and audiometric/histological/otoacoustic emission data acquired from previously exposed animals. Once trained, the model will be able to predict the auditory consequences of exposure to any noise environment characterized by ten noise metrics and five biological variables of the animals that are input to the model. There are two phases to this research. The first phase is the design of the system structure and implementation software (Year 1). The second phase involves training the system using an extensive database consisting of more than 2500 subjects on which comprehensive exposure and audiometric/histological data are available (Year 2). The training period will be an iterative process in which the RBFNN will be modified as training proceeds. The prediction model can also be used to design experimental conditions from which the model can be experimentally tested. The successful demonstration of the application of a RBFNN to the prediction of noise-induced auditory effects has considerable potential for application to the assessment of industrial and military noise environments for the protection of hearing in humans, and can result in a considerable savings in the amount of work/resources that are needed to develop new and improved noise standards. Specifically, given the many similarities in the response to noise of the chinchilla and the human, the model can be used to identify combinations of parameters of an exposure that are important determinants of damage that would also be applicable to human exposure conditions. The chinchilla model can be used as a template or a guide for developing a human model possibly from some of the existing human data from which current standards were developed.

"Computational Toxicity Assessment Using Omic Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The application of modern high throughput genomic and metabonomic technologies to the field of toxicology will provide significant breakthroughs and advances. By simultaneously looking at data on gene expression and metabolite concentrations, a more accurate and complete picture of cellular behavior can be determined. Using statistical and mathematical algorithms applied to high throughput data, toxicant exposure characterization will be computed including identification of type of exposure and estimates of dose amount. In the current proposal, we intend to apply the latest multivariate linear and non-linear statistical and mathematical techniques to find subtle and complex patterns in the data that are consistent with validated samples of known toxic exposure. By using supervised machine learning techniques, training data with cross-validated measurements will be used to quantitatively measure the accuracy of the proposed statistical techniques. By applying these techniques to a wide variety of both public and in house data samples consisting of gene expression data and metabolomic NMR concentration data, small correlations and patterns can be measured and used to characterize the type and amount of environmental and toxicant exposure to host organisms. The basic research carried out in this proposal can result in a useful analysis tool that has a broad applications in drug discovery as well as diagnostic applications in monitoring of host organism exposure to harmful substances.

"Biosurveillance/SNOMED-CT Natural Language Processing Bioterrorism remains a significant threat to our public health. Early identification of an increased rate of occurance of patient presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism is one important method to contain bioterror attacks and effect more rapid treatment of exposed individuals. Often presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism occur in significant numbers prior to the recognition that a bioterrorism related exposure has occurred. This presents an opportunity to capture and analyze signals from patient records. We propose to provide an abstraction of automated clinical information from the clinical record (section by section) that will be coded using SNOMED-CT which can serve as the substrate for surveillance data. We believe that this data (sets of codes by section of the clinical record) which holds the important and salient medical facts (codes) regarding the patients' presentation, findings, medications, allergies and co-morbidities could be abstracted from clinical records. In this study, we will analyze SNOMED-CT's ability to provide adequate content coverage for constellations of symptoms associated with exposures to agents of bioterrorism (i.e. Anthrax, Small Pox, Ricin, and Radiation exposure). Our method builds on the considerable body of research already available within our laboratory. We have been researching methods for codifying medical content using controlled medical vocabularies since 1987. For this study, we will employ the Mayo Vocabulary Server (MVS) developed in the Mayo Laboratory of Biomedical Informatics and has been used at Mayo, Johns Hopkins University and the VA medical centers all with great success. Our performanc2 of the MVS toolkit has been validated for diagnoses where we showed a sensitivity of 99.7% and a specificity of 97.9%.

"Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed 5-year career development award will provide training and experience in bioinformatics and the administration of large-scale epidemiologic studies and will prepare the applicant for a leadership role in the field of complex diseases. One of the strengths of the proposed plan is the commitment of three mentors with diverse and unique areas of expertise. They will oversee a phased development program to provide new and enhanced multidisciplinary skills in study management, the statistical genetics of complex disease, bioinformatics and computational biology, and the ethical issues associated with public health genomics. It will provide the specific and varied skills required to succeed in a career devoted to responsibly-conducted epidemiologic studies that employ state-of-the-art molecular and computational methods to elucidate the mechanisms of complex human diseases. In her research, the applicant will use DNA from mothers and infants enrolled in a large-scale birth defects surveillance study to investigate the multigenic origins of nonsyndromic oral clefts (NOC) using a novel application of a proven analytical approach, Bayesian networks. In accomplishing the first aim, she will identify and validate the most probable network linking the phenotype of isolated NOC to the candidate maternal and subject single nucleotide polymorphisms and environmental exposures among the majority race/ethnicity. Through the second aim, she will validate two approaches to phenotying non-isolated NOC. Finally, she will determine whether the model(s) generated in Aims 1 and 2 can be generalized to minority race/ethnicity groups. This project will provide the framework upon which the investigator will prepare for an independent research career. Additionally, by being the first investigation to concurrently consider the candidate environmental exposures and SNPs in several candidate genes previously associated with NOC in association studies, this work has the potential to move the study of NOC dramatically forward. Relevance: Cleft lip and/or cleft palate are among the most common birth defects have serious physical, psychological, and financial consequences for those affected. Despite this, little is known about the causes of these anomalies because clefts are the result of genetic and environmental risk factors, rather than a single factor. The proposed research has the potential to make a unique contribution to our understanding clefts because it uses novel analytical approaches that allow the simultaneous examination of many potential risk factors.           ",Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts,7102385,K08DE016956,"['artificial intelligence ', ' cleft palate ', ' genetics ', ' classification ', ' model ', ' career ', ' dissection ', ' phenotype ', ' clinical research ', ' environmental exposure ', ' ']",NIDCR,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K08,2006,129511,0.09004851276969744
"Statistical Methods for Predicting Suicide Attempt    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a Mentored Quantitative Research Career Development Award has been submitted with the goal of supporting the development of the applicant's career as a quantitative researcher in psychiatry. The training and research plan is intended to build on the candidate's prior work in the statistical analysis of clinical, biological and gene expression data on mood disorders. The application delineates plans for training and mentoring in the areas of biostatistics, bioinformatics, clinical diagnoses and neurobiology of depression, and genomic analysis necessary to enable the applicant to pursue an independent career of scientific inquiry in psychiatric statistics. These goals will be met by a combination of supervision and didactic course work in the Division of Neuroscience of the Department of Psychiatry of Columbia University. The aim of the Research Plan is to develop and evaluate efficient and flexible statistical methodology for the prediction of suicide attempts and completed suicides in patients with mood disorders. For the purposes of this study, suicide attempt will be defined as a self-destructive act with at least some intent to end one's life. The focus will be on developing and evaluating predictive models based on a large number of retrospective and longitudinal measurements on each subject, as opposed to identification of individual risk factors. Aim 1 proposes to build/evaluate classification models for suicide attempters/nonattempters based on complete data. Aim 2 will build/evaluate survival analysis models when some of the subjects have censored data. Aim 3 will concentrate on classification of post-mortem brain samples from suicide victims and normal controls as a method of identifying putative risk factors for suicidal behavior. This will include large-scale gene expression analysis as well as the analysis of receptor bindings and other biochemical information in suicide victims and normal controls.

The aim of this study is to develop and compare efficient and flexible statistical methodology for the prediction of future suicide attempts based on demographic, clinical and biological data tor the use of health professionals so that patients at risk for suicide can be identified and treated in advance.           ",Statistical Methods for Predicting Suicide Attempt,7265108,K25MH074068,"['Crying ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Purpose ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Range ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Future ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Biochemical Genetics ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Incidence ', ' Training ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' single episode major depressive disorder ', ' single episode Major Depression ', ' major depressive episode ', ' Single major depressive episode ', ' Single major depression ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Supervision ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Dimensions ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' interest ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' receptor binding ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Measures ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' accomplished suicide ', ' completed suicide ', ' commit suicide ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' suicide model ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' suicidal act ', ' suicide act ', ' suicide victim ', ' Drops ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K25,2007,129173,0.1447242079196291
"Machine Learning to Identify Complex Interactions in Genome-Wide Association Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The focus of this application is the development and validation of new computational approaches to identify complex interactions among genetic and environmental factors (features) which could be used to help identify individuals at high risk for a specific disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of the conditions in question. Specific Aims of the application include: 1 )To adapt a variety of statistical machine learning methods to the analysis of simulated high density genome scan and environmental exposure data and to evaluate their ability to identify SNPs and environmental factors that are jointly predictive of a binary trait; 2)To apply the described feature selection and model building techniques to the genome-wide SNP genotype data collected from two NHLBI-funded genome-wide association studies: a) the SNPs and Atherosclerosis (SEA) study predicting premature atherosclerosis, and b) the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics of Statins (CAPS) Study predicting LDL cholesterol; 3) to develop a study-specific publicly accessible web-site designed to help disseminate the methods and results of the project and 4) to support the NIH-wide Genes and Environment Initiative (GEI). This proposal represents a unique collaboration focusing on the development of new methods to more effectively identify interacting genetic and environmental factors that account for variation in risk for common cardiovascular and other disease phenotypes. If the risk is determined, in part by a gene-environment interaction, the preventive intervention could include altering the environmental exposure. Furthermore, determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that jointly influence risk may reveal new biologic pathways that would be appropriate targets for novel therapeutic interventions. Together, improved risk stratification and new pathophysiologic insights would be expected to reduce the burden of disease and accelerate the realization of true personalized medicine. Relevance of this research to public health: This project aims to develop new approaches to identify the relationship between genetic and environmental factors which could then be used to identify people at high risk for a disease. Determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that influence a person's risk of disease may help doctors reduce risk for disease and reveal new treatments for disease.

"The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        This competing renewal application requests five years of support for the Conte Center for the Neuroscience of Mental Disorders (CCNMD): The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior. The Surgeon General notes, that 30,000 suicides per year in the United States and ten times that number of suicide attempts, requires a response that involves improving our knowledge regarding the relative importance of multiple predictors of suicide risk. The CCNMD employs a multidisciplinary approach to develop a predictive and explanatory model for suicidal behavior. Project 1: In the brainstem of depressed suicides we have found more serotonin neurons, more TPH, less serotonin transporter expression and 5-HT1A binding, all effects that enhance activity. The brainstem changes may be a response to less serotonin input and lower neurodensity in ventral prefrontal cortex of suicide and that may underlie increased impulsivity and suicide risk. We plan to map the circuitry of suicide by adding studies of anterior cingulate and amygdala, and to study neuron survival in prefrontal cortex. Project 2: Microarray analysis of the transcriptome in the same brain regions as Project 1 will map altered gene expression and be compared to murine models in Projects 6 and 7. Project 3: CCNMD investigators have successfully tested a predictive stress-diathesis model where suicidal ideation is a proximal predictor and lifetime aggressivity/impulsivity is a trait predictor of suicide attempts in major depression. We now propose to evaluate potential causal factors (genes and adverse childhood experiences) and an intermediate biological phenotype, the HPA axis in a prospective study. Project 4: We will use PET to determine whether the postmortem receptor changes differentially associated with major depression and suicide can be distinguished in vivo. Effects of susceptibility gene expression on binding to 5-HTT, 5-HTiA and MAOA will be determined by PET and related to depression and suicidal behavior. Project 5 builds on our familial transmission results. This bottom-up familial transmission study will examine suicidality, aggression/impulsivity, serotonin susceptibility genes, and psychopathology in very high-risk families with depressed adolescent attempter probands. Projects 6 and 7 involve murine models of depression and aggression related to single genes and an inbred strain. Effects of altered gene expression at critical phases and of maternal deprivation on behavior, brain morphology, gene expression profiles, neurogenesis and biochemistry will be evaluated and compared with clinical findings. Project 8 proposed use of statistical model selection for suicide prediction and analysis of large postmortem and in vivo imaging data sets using statistical learning theory that allows the flexible fitting of models with many predictors.       ",The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior,7249470,P50MH062185,"['brain morphology ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Brain region ', ' HPSE gene ', ' HSE1 ', ' HPSE1 ', ' HPR1 ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' microarray technology ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Inbred Strain ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecuar profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' in vivo ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Family ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' serotonin transporter ', ' sodium-dependent serotonin transporter ', ' 5HTT protein ', ' 5HT transporter ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' improved ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Numbers ', ' Maps ', ' Maternal Deprivation ', ' mother deprivation ', ' Methaqualone ', ' Ortonal ', ' Metolquizolone ', ' MTQ ', ' MAOA ', ' 3,4-Dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxo-3-o-tolylquinazoline ', ' 2-Methyl-3-o-tolyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone ', ' 2-Methyl-3-(2-methylphenyl)-4(3H)-quinazolinone ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Phenotype ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Serotonin ', ' Hippophaine ', ' Enteramine ', ' 5HT ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine ', ' 5-HT ', ' 3-(2-Aminoethyl)-1H-indol-5-ol ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' trait ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' proband ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' neurogenesis ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,P50,2007,2239211,0.1028834399502532
"Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed 5-year career development award will provide training and experience in bioinformatics and the administration of large-scale epidemiologic studies and will prepare the applicant for a leadership role in the field of complex diseases. One of the strengths of the proposed plan is the commitment of three mentors with diverse and unique areas of expertise. They will oversee a phased development program to provide new and enhanced multidisciplinary skills in study management, the statistical genetics of complex disease, bioinformatics and computational biology, and the ethical issues associated with public health genomics. It will provide the specific and varied skills required to succeed in a career devoted to responsibly-conducted epidemiologic studies that employ state-of-the-art molecular and computational methods to elucidate the mechanisms of complex human diseases. In her research, the applicant will use DNA from mothers and infants enrolled in a large-scale birth defects surveillance study to investigate the multigenic origins of nonsyndromic oral clefts (NOC) using a novel application of a proven analytical approach, Bayesian networks. In accomplishing the first aim, she will identify and validate the most probable network linking the phenotype of isolated NOC to the candidate maternal and subject single nucleotide polymorphisms and environmental exposures among the majority race/ethnicity. Through the second aim, she will validate two approaches to phenotying non-isolated NOC. Finally, she will determine whether the model(s) generated in Aims 1 and 2 can be generalized to minority race/ethnicity groups. This project will provide the framework upon which the investigator will prepare for an independent research career. Additionally, by being the first investigation to concurrently consider the candidate environmental exposures and SNPs in several candidate genes previously associated with NOC in association studies, this work has the potential to move the study of NOC dramatically forward. Relevance: Cleft lip and/or cleft palate are among the most common birth defects have serious physical, psychological, and financial consequences for those affected. Despite this, little is known about the causes of these anomalies because clefts are the result of genetic and environmental risk factors, rather than a single factor. The proposed research has the potential to make a unique contribution to our understanding clefts because it uses novel analytical approaches that allow the simultaneous examination of many potential risk factors.           ",Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts,7229521,K08DE016956,"['psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Infant ', ' Training ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Logistic Models ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Mothers ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Program Development ', ' Cleaved cell ', ' cleaved ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Arts ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Class ', ' experience ', ' heuristics ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' Molecular Genetic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cleft Lip ', ' hare lip ', ' Harelip ', ' Cleft Palate ', ' oral cleft ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' Minority ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' human disease ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Defect ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Molecular ', ' Affect ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' ']",NIDCR,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K08,2007,129498,0.09004851276969744
"Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Discordant phenotypes and varying incidences of complex diseases in monozygotic twins as well as genetically identical organisms have long been attributed to differential environmental exposures. Accumulating evidence indicates, however, that epigenetic gene dysregulation by DNA methylation and histone modifications from environmental exposures also play a role in this differential susceptibility to disease. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this grant application is that early exposure to environmental agents influences adult disease susceptibility by causing stable alterations in critical DNA control elements that regulate metastable epialleles - genes whose epigenome is established probabilistically during development, leading to variable gene expressivity and widely varying individual adult phenotypes. Despite a growing consensus on the importance of epigenetics in the etiology of chronic human diseases, the genes most prone to epigenetic dysregulation are incompletely defined. Moreover, neither the environmental agents most strongly affecting the epigenome nor the critical windows of vulnerability to environmentally induced epigenetic alterations have been characterized. These major deficits in knowledge have severely constrained our ability to systematically define and characterize the metastable epialleles mechanistically involved in the etiology of human diseases. The overall objective of this grant application is to help correct these deficiencies by using the viable yellow Agouti (Avy) mouse model, as well as human samples to identify environmentally responsive, metastable epialleles in the mouse and human genomes. Specifically, the intent is to determine if maternal dietary supplementation of Avy mice with low levels of the plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA) affects adult phenotype of the offspring by altering the fetal epigenome. Gene expression and genome-wide bioinformatic approaches to identify imprinted and non-imprinted metastable epialleles in both mice and humans will be employed. The results of this study should ultimately allow for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of chronic human diseases such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurological disorders by targeting the epigenome rather than the genome. They will also be helpful in determining under what circumstances the mouse is an appropriate toxicological model for assessing human risk from agents that elicit their biological effect primarily by altering the epigenome.             ",Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes,7290450,R01ES015165,"['Acids ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Monozygotic Twinning ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) ', ' CHIP assay ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Detection ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Supplementation ', ' Chemical Agents ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Female ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Germ Layers ', ' human birth weight ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Histones ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Chronic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Incidence ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks) ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-6 weeks old ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Dietary Supplementation ', ' Genomic Imprinting ', ' Parental Imprinting ', ' Genetic Imprinting ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' Maternal Exposure ', ' uptake ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Plasticizers ', ' Plastics ', ' Play ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Probability ', ' Exposure to ', ' Production ', ' environmental agent ', ' Figs - dietary ', ' Figs ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Monozygotic twins ', ' Identical Twins ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Xenobiotics ', ' Complex ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' fetal ', ' bisphenol A ', ' diphenylolpropane ', "" 4,4' isopropylidinediphenol "", ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' toxicant ', ' Genistein ', ' Prunetol ', ' Genisteol ', ' Genestein ', ' 5,7-Dihydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one ', "" 4',5,7-Trihydroxyisoflavone "", ' bisulfite ', ' hydrosulfite ', ' hydrogen sulfite ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Chromatin ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Color ', ' Barker Hypothesis ', ' Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Basis of Adult Disease ', ' FeBAD ', ' maternal cigarette smoking ', ' maternal smoking ', ' Population ', ' imprint ', ' mouse genome ', ' human disease ', ' mouse model ', ' ']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,568393,0.03551140069556963
"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.           ",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL

"Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Discordant phenotypes and varying incidences of complex diseases in monozygotic twins as well as genetically identical organisms have long been attributed to differential environmental exposures. Accumulating evidence indicates, however, that epigenetic gene dysregulation by DNA methylation and histone modifications from environmental exposures also play a role in this differential susceptibility to disease. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this grant application is that early exposure to environmental agents influences adult disease susceptibility by causing stable alterations in critical DNA control elements that regulate metastable epialleles - genes whose epigenome is established probabilistically during development, leading to variable gene expressivity and widely varying individual adult phenotypes. Despite a growing consensus on the importance of epigenetics in the etiology of chronic human diseases, the genes most prone to epigenetic dysregulation are incompletely defined. Moreover, neither the environmental agents most strongly affecting the epigenome nor the critical windows of vulnerability to environmentally induced epigenetic alterations have been characterized. These major deficits in knowledge have severely constrained our ability to systematically define and characterize the metastable epialleles mechanistically involved in the etiology of human diseases. The overall objective of this grant application is to help correct these deficiencies by using the viable yellow Agouti (Avy) mouse model, as well as human samples to identify environmentally responsive, metastable epialleles in the mouse and human genomes. Specifically, the intent is to determine if maternal dietary supplementation of Avy mice with low levels of the plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA) affects adult phenotype of the offspring by altering the fetal epigenome. Gene expression and genome-wide bioinformatic approaches to identify imprinted and non-imprinted metastable epialleles in both mice and humans will be employed. The results of this study should ultimately allow for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of chronic human diseases such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurological disorders by targeting the epigenome rather than the genome. They will also be helpful in determining under what circumstances the mouse is an appropriate toxicological model for assessing human risk from agents that elicit their biological effect primarily by altering the epigenome.             ",Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes,7478414,R01ES015165,"['Research ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Monozygotic twins ', ' Identical Twins ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Xenobiotics ', ' Complex ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' fetal ', ' bisphenol A ', ' diphenylolpropane ', "" 4,4' isopropylidinediphenol "", ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' toxicant ', ' Genistein ', ' Prunetol ', ' Genisteol ', ' Genestein ', ' 5,7-Dihydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one ', "" 4',5,7-Trihydroxyisoflavone "", ' bisulfite ', ' hydrosulfite ', ' hydrogen sulfite ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Chromatin ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Color ', ' Barker Hypothesis ', ' Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Basis of Adult Disease ', ' FeBAD ', ' maternal cigarette smoking ', ' maternal smoking ', ' Population ', ' imprint ', ' mouse genome ', ' human disease ', ' mouse model ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Monozygotic Twinning ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) ', ' CHIP assay ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Detection ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Supplementation ', ' Chemical Agents ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Female ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Germ Layers ', ' human birth weight ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Histones ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Chronic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Incidence ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks) ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-6 weeks old ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Dietary Supplementation ', ' Genomic Imprinting ', ' Parental Imprinting ', ' Genetic Imprinting ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' Maternal Exposure ', ' uptake ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Plasticizers ', ' Plastics ', ' Play ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Probability ', ' Exposure to ', ' Production ', ' environmental agent ', ' Figs - dietary ', ' Figs ', ' Acids ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' ']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,577197,0.03551140069556963
"Machine Learning to Identify Complex Interactions in Genome-Wide Association Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The focus of this application is the development and validation of new computational approaches to identify complex interactions among genetic and environmental factors (features) which could be used to help identify individuals at high risk for a specific disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of the conditions in question. Specific Aims of the application include: 1 )To adapt a variety of statistical machine learning methods to the analysis of simulated high density genome scan and environmental exposure data and to evaluate their ability to identify SNPs and environmental factors that are jointly predictive of a binary trait; 2)To apply the described feature selection and model building techniques to the genome-wide SNP genotype data collected from two NHLBI-funded genome-wide association studies: a) the SNPs and Atherosclerosis (SEA) study predicting premature atherosclerosis, and b) the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics of Statins (CAPS) Study predicting LDL cholesterol; 3) to develop a study-specific publicly accessible web-site designed to help disseminate the methods and results of the project and 4) to support the NIH-wide Genes and Environment Initiative (GEI). This proposal represents a unique collaboration focusing on the development of new methods to more effectively identify interacting genetic and environmental factors that account for variation in risk for common cardiovascular and other disease phenotypes. If the risk is determined, in part by a gene-environment interaction, the preventive intervention could include altering the environmental exposure. Furthermore, determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that jointly influence risk may reveal new biologic pathways that would be appropriate targets for novel therapeutic interventions. Together, improved risk stratification and new pathophysiologic insights would be expected to reduce the burden of disease and accelerate the realization of true personalized medicine. Relevance of this research to public health: This project aims to develop new approaches to identify the relationship between genetic and environmental factors which could then be used to identify people at high risk for a disease. Determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that influence a person's risk of disease may help doctors reduce risk for disease and reveal new treatments for disease.

"Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed 5-year career development award will provide training and experience in bioinformatics and the administration of large-scale epidemiologic studies and will prepare the applicant for a leadership role in the field of complex diseases. One of the strengths of the proposed plan is the commitment of three mentors with diverse and unique areas of expertise. They will oversee a phased development program to provide new and enhanced multidisciplinary skills in study management, the statistical genetics of complex disease, bioinformatics and computational biology, and the ethical issues associated with public health genomics. It will provide the specific and varied skills required to succeed in a career devoted to responsibly-conducted epidemiologic studies that employ state-of-the-art molecular and computational methods to elucidate the mechanisms of complex human diseases. In her research, the applicant will use DNA from mothers and infants enrolled in a large-scale birth defects surveillance study to investigate the multigenic origins of nonsyndromic oral clefts (NOC) using a novel application of a proven analytical approach, Bayesian networks. In accomplishing the first aim, she will identify and validate the most probable network linking the phenotype of isolated NOC to the candidate maternal and subject single nucleotide polymorphisms and environmental exposures among the majority race/ethnicity. Through the second aim, she will validate two approaches to phenotying non-isolated NOC. Finally, she will determine whether the model(s) generated in Aims 1 and 2 can be generalized to minority race/ethnicity groups. This project will provide the framework upon which the investigator will prepare for an independent research career. Additionally, by being the first investigation to concurrently consider the candidate environmental exposures and SNPs in several candidate genes previously associated with NOC in association studies, this work has the potential to move the study of NOC dramatically forward. Relevance: Cleft lip and/or cleft palate are among the most common birth defects have serious physical, psychological, and financial consequences for those affected. Despite this, little is known about the causes of these anomalies because clefts are the result of genetic and environmental risk factors, rather than a single factor. The proposed research has the potential to make a unique contribution to our understanding clefts because it uses novel analytical approaches that allow the simultaneous examination of many potential risk factors.           ",Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts,7393693,K08DE016956,"['Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Defect ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Molecular ', ' Affect ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Infant ', ' Training ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Logistic Models ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Mothers ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Program Development ', ' Cleaved cell ', ' cleaved ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Arts ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Class ', ' experience ', ' heuristics ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' Molecular Genetic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cleft Lip ', ' hare lip ', ' Harelip ', ' Cleft Palate ', ' oral cleft ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' Minority ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' human disease ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' ']",NIDCR,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K08,2008,129484,0.09004851276969744
"Towards a cognitive framework for understanding cellular behavior Abstract Free-living cells display strong genome-wide transcriptional responses to changes in individual environmental parameters such as oxygen and temperature. Such transcriptional dynamics are thought to be the basis of a homeostatic response that attempts to reverse the immediate intracellular consequences resulting from the specific change in the environment. I present an alternative interpretation where transcriptional responses reflect a multifaceted behavioral program in response to global changes in the environment that are anticipated to follow the perturbation. This results from the fact that native microbial habitats are highly structured, giving rise to strong correlations between environmental parameters. Over geological timescales, such correlations can be internalized through an ""associative learning"" process that shapes the connectivity and dynamics of regulatory networks. Such internal models should allow microbes to predict the future trajectory of the environment based on immediate sensory information. We have seen evidence of this anticipatory behavior in responses of the bacterium Escherichia coli to changes in temperature and oxygen that correspond to transitions between the outside environment and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. These internal representations seem to reflect a true associative learning paradigm, since they show plasticity upon exposure to novel environments. These phenomena increasingly demand that we interpret microbial behaviors from a cognitive perspective, much as we do for understanding animal behaviors. I propose a multi-faceted research program aimed at 1) establishing that these phenomena, indeed, represent cognitive modeling of microbial habitats, 2) revealing the underlying network mechanisms, and 3) exploring associative learning of novel environments through laboratory experimental evolution. The proposed work establishes deep connections between the disparate fields of microbial ecology, regulatory network evolution, and behavior. In so doing, it challenges the dominance of the century-old notion of homeostasis, with fundamental implications for how we understand and control microbial behavior, especially in the context of disease.

"Statistical Methods for Predicting Suicide Attempt    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a Mentored Quantitative Research Career Development Award has been submitted with the goal of supporting the development of the applicant's career as a quantitative researcher in psychiatry. The training and research plan is intended to build on the candidate's prior work in the statistical analysis of clinical, biological and gene expression data on mood disorders. The application delineates plans for training and mentoring in the areas of biostatistics, bioinformatics, clinical diagnoses and neurobiology of depression, and genomic analysis necessary to enable the applicant to pursue an independent career of scientific inquiry in psychiatric statistics. These goals will be met by a combination of supervision and didactic course work in the Division of Neuroscience of the Department of Psychiatry of Columbia University. The aim of the Research Plan is to develop and evaluate efficient and flexible statistical methodology for the prediction of suicide attempts and completed suicides in patients with mood disorders. For the purposes of this study, suicide attempt will be defined as a self-destructive act with at least some intent to end one's life. The focus will be on developing and evaluating predictive models based on a large number of retrospective and longitudinal measurements on each subject, as opposed to identification of individual risk factors. Aim 1 proposes to build/evaluate classification models for suicide attempters/nonattempters based on complete data. Aim 2 will build/evaluate survival analysis models when some of the subjects have censored data. Aim 3 will concentrate on classification of post-mortem brain samples from suicide victims and normal controls as a method of identifying putative risk factors for suicidal behavior.

"The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        This competing renewal application requests five years of support for the Conte Center for the Neuroscience of Mental Disorders (CCNMD): The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior. The Surgeon General notes, that 30,000 suicides per year in the United States and ten times that number of suicide attempts, requires a response that involves improving our knowledge regarding the relative importance of multiple predictors of suicide risk. The CCNMD employs a multidisciplinary approach to develop a predictive and explanatory model for suicidal behavior. Project 1: In the brainstem of depressed suicides we have found more serotonin neurons, more TPH, less serotonin transporter expression and 5-HT1A binding, all effects that enhance activity. The brainstem changes may be a response to less serotonin input and lower neurodensity in ventral prefrontal cortex of suicide and that may underlie increased impulsivity and suicide risk. We plan to map the circuitry of suicide by adding studies of anterior cingulate and amygdala, and to study neuron survival in prefrontal cortex. Project 2: Microarray analysis of the transcriptome in the same brain regions as Project 1 will map altered gene expression and be compared to murine models in Projects 6 and 7. Project 3: CCNMD investigators have successfully tested a predictive stress-diathesis model where suicidal ideation is a proximal predictor and lifetime aggressivity/impulsivity is a trait predictor of suicide attempts in major depression. We now propose to evaluate potential causal factors (genes and adverse childhood experiences) and an intermediate biological phenotype, the HPA axis in a prospective study. Project 4: We will use PET to determine whether the postmortem receptor changes differentially associated with major depression and suicide can be distinguished in vivo. Effects of susceptibility gene expression on binding to 5-HTT, 5-HTiA and MAOA will be determined by PET and related to depression and suicidal behavior. Project 5 builds on our familial transmission results. This bottom-up familial transmission study will examine suicidality, aggression/impulsivity, serotonin susceptibility genes, and psychopathology in very high-risk families with depressed adolescent attempter probands. Projects 6 and 7 involve murine models of depression and aggression related to single genes and an inbred strain. Effects of altered gene expression at critical phases and of maternal deprivation on behavior, brain morphology, gene expression profiles, neurogenesis and biochemistry will be evaluated and compared with clinical findings. Project 8 proposed use of statistical model selection for suicide prediction and analysis of large postmortem and in vivo imaging data sets using statistical learning theory that allows the flexible fitting of models with many predictors.       ",The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior,7457762,P50MH062185,"['Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Phenotype ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' brain morphology ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Brain region ', ' HPSE gene ', ' HSE1 ', ' HPSE1 ', ' HPR1 ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' microarray technology ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Inbred Strain ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecuar profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' in vivo ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Family ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' serotonin transporter ', ' sodium-dependent serotonin transporter ', ' 5HTT protein ', ' 5HT transporter ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' improved ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Numbers ', ' Maps ', ' Maternal Deprivation ', ' mother deprivation ', ' Methaqualone ', ' Ortonal ', ' Metolquizolone ', ' MTQ ', ' MAOA ', ' 3,4-Dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxo-3-o-tolylquinazoline ', ' 2-Methyl-3-o-tolyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone ', ' 2-Methyl-3-(2-methylphenyl)-4(3H)-quinazolinone ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Serotonin ', ' Hippophaine ', ' Enteramine ', ' 5HT ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine ', ' 5-HT ', ' 3-(2-Aminoethyl)-1H-indol-5-ol ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' trait ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' proband ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' neurogenesis ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,P50,2008,2172581,0.1028834399502532
"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.           ",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL

"Statistical Methods for Predicting Suicide Attempt    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a Mentored Quantitative Research Career Development Award has been submitted with the goal of supporting the development of the applicant's career as a quantitative researcher in psychiatry. The training and research plan is intended to build on the candidate's prior work in the statistical analysis of clinical, biological and gene expression data on mood disorders. The application delineates plans for training and mentoring in the areas of biostatistics, bioinformatics, clinical diagnoses and neurobiology of depression, and genomic analysis necessary to enable the applicant to pursue an independent career of scientific inquiry in psychiatric statistics. These goals will be met by a combination of supervision and didactic course work in the Division of Neuroscience of the Department of Psychiatry of Columbia University. The aim of the Research Plan is to develop and evaluate efficient and flexible statistical methodology for the prediction of suicide attempts and completed suicides in patients with mood disorders. For the purposes of this study, suicide attempt will be defined as a self-destructive act with at least some intent to end one's life. The focus will be on developing and evaluating predictive models based on a large number of retrospective and longitudinal measurements on each subject, as opposed to identification of individual risk factors. Aim 1 proposes to build/evaluate classification models for suicide attempters/nonattempters based on complete data. Aim 2 will build/evaluate survival analysis models when some of the subjects have censored data. Aim 3 will concentrate on classification of post-mortem brain samples from suicide victims and normal controls as a method of identifying putative risk factors for suicidal behavior. This will include large-scale gene expression analysis as well as the analysis of receptor bindings and other biochemical information in suicide victims and normal controls. Relevance: Suicide causes over 30,000 deaths annually in the USA, and the number of suicide attempts is thought to be at least several times that.

"Machine Learning to Identify Complex Interactions in Genome-Wide Association Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The focus of this application is the development and validation of new computational approaches to identify complex interactions among genetic and environmental factors (features) which could be used to help identify individuals at high risk for a specific disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of the conditions in question. Specific Aims of the application include: 1 )To adapt a variety of statistical machine learning methods to the analysis of simulated high density genome scan and environmental exposure data and to evaluate their ability to identify SNPs and environmental factors that are jointly predictive of a binary trait; 2)To apply the described feature selection and model building techniques to the genome-wide SNP genotype data collected from two NHLBI-funded genome-wide association studies: a) the SNPs and Atherosclerosis (SEA) study predicting premature atherosclerosis, and b) the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics of Statins (CAPS) Study predicting LDL cholesterol; 3) to develop a study-specific publicly accessible web-site designed to help disseminate the methods and results of the project and 4) to support the NIH-wide Genes and Environment Initiative (GEI). This proposal represents a unique collaboration focusing on the development of new methods to more effectively identify interacting genetic and environmental factors that account for variation in risk for common cardiovascular and other disease phenotypes. If the risk is determined, in part by a gene-environment interaction, the preventive intervention could include altering the environmental exposure. Furthermore, determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that jointly influence risk may reveal new biologic pathways that would be appropriate targets for novel therapeutic interventions. Together, improved risk stratification and new pathophysiologic insights would be expected to reduce the burden of disease and accelerate the realization of true personalized medicine. Relevance of this research to public health: This project aims to develop new approaches to identify the relationship between genetic and environmental factors which could then be used to identify people at high risk for a disease. Determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that influence a person's risk of disease may help doctors reduce risk for disease and reveal new treatments for disease.

Projects 6 and 7 involve murine models of depression and aggression related to single genes and an inbred strain. Effects of altered gene expression at critical phases and of maternal deprivation on behavior, brain morphology, gene expression profiles, neurogenesis and biochemistry will be evaluated and compared with clinical findings. Project 8 proposed use of statistical model selection for suicide prediction and analysis of large postmortem and in vivo imaging data sets using statistical learning theory that allows the flexible fitting of models with many predictors.       ",The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior,7640534,P50MH062185,"['brain morphology ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Brain region ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' microarray technology ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Inbred Strain ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecuar profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' in vivo ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Family ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' serotonin transporter ', ' sodium-dependent serotonin transporter ', ' 5HTT protein ', ' 5HT transporter ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' improved ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Maps ', ' Maternal Deprivation ', ' mother deprivation ', ' Methaqualone ', ' Ortonal ', ' Metolquizolone ', ' MTQ ', ' MAOA ', ' 3,4-Dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxo-3-o-tolylquinazoline ', ' 2-Methyl-3-o-tolyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone ', ' 2-Methyl-3-(2-methylphenyl)-4(3H)-quinazolinone ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Phenotype ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Serotonin ', ' Hippophaine ', ' Enteramine ', ' 5HT ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine ', ' 5-HT ', ' 3-(2-Aminoethyl)-1H-indol-5-ol ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' trait ', ' Brain Stem ', ' Brainstem ', ' proband ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' neurogenesis ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' high risk ', ' depression ', ' depressed ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' ']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,P50,2009,2190734,0.1028834399502532
"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.              The identification of novel

"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.           ",MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL

"Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed 5-year career development award will provide training and experience in bioinformatics and the administration of large-scale epidemiologic studies and will prepare the applicant for a leadership role in the field of complex diseases. One of the strengths of the proposed plan is the commitment of three mentors with diverse and unique areas of expertise. They will oversee a phased development program to provide new and enhanced multidisciplinary skills in study management, the statistical genetics of complex disease, bioinformatics and computational biology, and the ethical issues associated with public health genomics. It will provide the specific and varied skills required to succeed in a career devoted to responsibly-conducted epidemiologic studies that employ state-of-the-art molecular and computational methods to elucidate the mechanisms of complex human diseases. In her research, the applicant will use DNA from mothers and infants enrolled in a large-scale birth defects surveillance study to investigate the multigenic origins of nonsyndromic oral clefts (NOC) using a novel application of a proven analytical approach, Bayesian networks. In accomplishing the first aim, she will identify and validate the most probable network linking the phenotype of isolated NOC to the candidate maternal and subject single nucleotide polymorphisms and environmental exposures among the majority race/ethnicity. Through the second aim, she will validate two approaches to phenotying non-isolated NOC. Finally, she will determine whether the model(s) generated in Aims 1 and 2 can be generalized to minority race/ethnicity groups. This project will provide the framework upon which the investigator will prepare for an independent research career. Additionally, by being the first investigation to concurrently consider the candidate environmental exposures and SNPs in several candidate genes previously associated with NOC in association studies, this work has the potential to move the study of NOC dramatically forward. Relevance: Cleft lip and/or cleft palate are among the most common birth defects have serious physical, psychological, and financial consequences for those affected. Despite this, little is known about the causes of these anomalies because clefts are the result of genetic and environmental risk factors, rather than a single factor. The proposed research has the potential to make a unique contribution to our understanding clefts because it uses novel analytical approaches that allow the simultaneous examination of many potential risk factors.           ",Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts,7616441,K08DE016956,"['Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Defect ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Molecular ', ' Affect ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Infant ', ' Training ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Mothers ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Program Development ', ' Cleaved cell ', ' cleaved ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Arts ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' heuristics ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' Molecular Genetic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cleft lip with or without cleft palate ', ' cl/p ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cleft Lip ', ' hare lip ', ' Harelip ', ' Cleft Palate ', ' oral cleft ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' Minority ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' human disease ', ' surveillance study ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' ']",NIDCR,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K08,2009,129470,0.09004851276969744
"Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Discordant phenotypes and varying incidences of complex diseases in monozygotic twins as well as genetically identical organisms have long been attributed to differential environmental exposures. Accumulating evidence indicates, however, that epigenetic gene dysregulation by DNA methylation and histone modifications from environmental exposures also play a role in this differential susceptibility to disease. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this grant application is that early exposure to environmental agents influences adult disease susceptibility by causing stable alterations in critical DNA control elements that regulate metastable epialleles - genes whose epigenome is established probabilistically during development, leading to variable gene expressivity and widely varying individual adult phenotypes. Despite a growing consensus on the importance of epigenetics in the etiology of chronic human diseases, the genes most prone to epigenetic dysregulation are incompletely defined. Moreover, neither the environmental agents most strongly affecting the epigenome nor the critical windows of vulnerability to environmentally induced epigenetic alterations have been characterized. These major deficits in knowledge have severely constrained our ability to systematically define and characterize the metastable epialleles mechanistically involved in the etiology of human diseases. The overall objective of this grant application is to help correct these deficiencies by using the viable yellow Agouti (Avy) mouse model, as well as human samples to identify environmentally responsive, metastable epialleles in the mouse and human genomes. Specifically, the intent is to determine if maternal dietary supplementation of Avy mice with low levels of the plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA) affects adult phenotype of the offspring by altering the fetal epigenome. Gene expression and genome-wide bioinformatic approaches to identify imprinted and non-imprinted metastable epialleles in both mice and humans will be employed. The results of this study should ultimately allow for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of chronic human diseases such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurological disorders by targeting the epigenome rather than the genome. They will also be helpful in determining under what circumstances the mouse is an appropriate toxicological model for assessing human risk from agents that elicit their biological effect primarily by altering the epigenome.             ",Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes,7650125,R01ES015165,"['offspring ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Color ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' maternal cigarette smoking ', ' maternal smoking ', ' Population ', ' imprint ', ' mouse genome ', ' human disease ', ' mouse model ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' Acids ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' histone modification ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Monozygotic Twinning ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) ', ' CHIP assay ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Detection ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Chemical Agents ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood ', ' fetal cord blood ', ' Cord Blood ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Germ Layers ', ' human birth weight ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Histones ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Incidence ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks) ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-6 weeks old ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Dietary Supplementation ', ' Genomic Imprinting ', ' Parental Imprinting ', ' Genetic Imprinting ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' Maternal Exposure ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasticizers ', ' Plastics ', ' Play ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Probability ', ' Exposure to ', ' Production ', ' environmental agent ', ' Figs - dietary ', ' Figs ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Monozygotic twins ', ' Identical Twins ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Xenobiotics ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' fetal ', ' bisphenol A ', ' diphenylolpropane ', "" 4,4' isopropylidinediphenol "", ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Genistein ', ' Prunetol ', ' Genisteol ', ' Genestein ', ' 5,7-Dihydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one ', "" 4',5,7-Trihydroxyisoflavone "", ' bisulfite ', ' hydrosulfite ', ' hydrogen sulfite ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' ']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,578836,0.03551140069556963
"Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed 5-year career development award will provide training and experience in bioinformatics and the administration of large-scale epidemiologic studies and will prepare the applicant for a leadership role in the field of complex diseases. One of the strengths of the proposed plan is the commitment of three mentors with diverse and unique areas of expertise. They will oversee a phased development program to provide new and enhanced multidisciplinary skills in study management, the statistical genetics of complex disease, bioinformatics and computational biology, and the ethical issues associated with public health genomics. It will provide the specific and varied skills required to succeed in a career devoted to responsibly-conducted epidemiologic studies that employ state-of-the-art molecular and computational methods to elucidate the mechanisms of complex human diseases. In her research, the applicant will use DNA from mothers and infants enrolled in a large-scale birth defects surveillance study to investigate the multigenic origins of nonsyndromic oral clefts (NOC) using a novel application of a proven analytical approach, Bayesian networks. In accomplishing the first aim, she will identify and validate the most probable network linking the phenotype of isolated NOC to the candidate maternal and subject single nucleotide polymorphisms and environmental exposures among the majority race/ethnicity. Through the second aim, she will validate two approaches to phenotying non-isolated NOC. Finally, she will determine whether the model(s) generated in Aims 1 and 2 can be generalized to minority race/ethnicity groups. This project will provide the framework upon which the investigator will prepare for an independent research career. Additionally, by being the first investigation to concurrently consider the candidate environmental exposures and SNPs in several candidate genes previously associated with NOC in association studies, this work has the potential to move the study of NOC dramatically forward. Relevance: Cleft lip and/or cleft palate are among the most common birth defects have serious physical, psychological, and financial consequences for those affected. Despite this, little is known about the causes of these anomalies because clefts are the result of genetic and environmental risk factors, rather than a single factor. The proposed research has the potential to make a unique contribution to our understanding clefts because it uses novel analytical approaches that allow the simultaneous examination of many potential risk factors.           ",Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts,7809627,K08DE016956,"['Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Defect ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' human disease ', ' surveillance study ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Molecular ', ' Affect ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Infant ', ' Training ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Mothers ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Program Development ', ' Cleaved cell ', ' cleaved ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computational Biology ', ' Arts ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' heuristics ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Congenital Abnormality ', ' Molecular Genetic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cleft lip with or without cleft palate ', ' cl/p ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cleft Lip ', ' hare lip ', ' Harelip ', ' Cleft Palate ', ' oral cleft ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' Minority ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ']",NIDCR,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K08,2010,129456,0.09004851276969744
"Statistical Methods for Predicting Sucicide Attempt    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a Mentored Quantitative Research Career Development Award has been submitted with the goal of supporting the development of the applicant's career as a quantitative researcher in psychiatry. The training and research plan is intended to build on the candidate's prior work in the statistical analysis of clinical, biological and gene expression data on mood disorders. The application delineates plans for training and mentoring in the areas of biostatistics, bioinformatics, clinical diagnoses and neurobiology of depression, and genomic analysis necessary to enable the applicant to pursue an independent career of scientific inquiry in psychiatric statistics. These goals will be met by a combination of supervision and didactic course work in the Division of Neuroscience of the Department of Psychiatry of Columbia University. The aim of the Research Plan is to develop and evaluate efficient and flexible statistical methodology for the prediction of suicide attempts and completed suicides in patients with mood disorders. For the purposes of this study, suicide attempt will be defined as a self-destructive act with at least some intent to end one's life. The focus will be on developing and evaluating predictive models based on a large number of retrospective and longitudinal measurements on each subject, as opposed to identification of individual risk factors. Aim 1 proposes to build/evaluate classification models for suicide attempters/nonattempters based on complete data. Aim 2 will build/evaluate survival analysis models when some of the subjects have censored data. Aim 3 will concentrate on classification of post-mortem brain samples from suicide victims and normal controls as a method of identifying putative risk factors for suicidal behavior. This will include large-scale gene expression analysis as well as the analysis of receptor bindings and other biochemical information in suicide victims and normal controls. Relevance: Suicide causes over 30,000 deaths annually in the USA, and the number of suicide attempts is thought to be at least several times that. The aim of this study is to develop and compare efficient and flexible statistical methodology for the prediction of future suicide attempts based on demographic, clinical and biological data tor the use of health professionals so that patients at risk for suicide can be identified and treated in advance.           ",Statistical Methods for Predicting Sucicide Attempt,7880713,K25MH074068,"['Crying ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Future ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Gene Expression ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Incidence ', ' Training ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Sample Size ', ' single episode major depressive disorder ', ' single episode Major Depression ', ' major depressive episode ', ' Single major depressive episode ', ' Single major depression ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Supervision ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Dimensions ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' interest ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' meetings ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' receptor binding ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Measures ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' accomplished suicide ', ' completed suicide ', ' commit suicide ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' suicide model ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' suicidal act ', ' suicide act ', ' suicide victim ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Drops ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K25,2010,129740,0.14137864670871259
"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.              The identification of novel

"MAGNETIC RESONANCE AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING OF A MOUSE FASD MODEL U01 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), significant components of which are Central Nervous System (CMS) and craniofacial abnormalities, are a major public health problem. While eliminating FASD is the ultimate goal for both clinical and basic FASD research, we recognize that in the near future, adverse effects from prenatal ethanol exposure will persist. To better diagnose and treat affected individuals, a more complete understanding of the full spectrum of the ethanol-induced abnormalities is needed. The proposed investigations are designed to integrate with those of other consortium members in meeting this need. For this work, both high resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which can provide 29 micron (or less) isotropic scans and subsequent accurate 3-D reconstructions and segmental analyses, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), which allows CMS fiber tract analyses, will be applied to the study of an FASD mouse model. Previous research utilizing this model has established critical exposure times that yield facial and CNS abnormalities that are consistent with full-blown Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, as well as other components of FASD. The proposed studies will employ this model and both acute and chronic ethanol treatment paradigms to test the overall hypothesis that in mice, ethanol induces structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are consistent with and informative for those in human FASD. To this end, utilizing MRI and DTI as high throughput screening platforms, we propose to address the following specific aims : 1) to provide comprehensive documentation and discovery of the ethanol-induced CNS dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure at embryonic and early fetal stages of development; 2) to define the facial dysmorphology that results from prenatal ethanol exposure during embryonic and/or early fetal stages and to relate their character and severity to accompanying abnormalities of the brain; and 3) to identify regions other than the brain or face that may serve as diagnostic indicators of prenatal ethanol exposure. The results of the proposed studies will be compared to those of corresponding investigations by other consortium members. It is expected that the structural abnormalities of the brain and face that are induced by ethanol in mice will reflect the pattern of defects observed in children with FASD, will inform human diagnostic tests, and will provide new information that will be helpful in reducing the incidence of FASD.

"Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by myelin loss, varying degrees of axonal pathology, and progressive neurological dysfunction. The combined effect of many genes, environmental exposures acting during defined periods of life, and their interactions in MS is strongly supported by our own work and others. The involvement of HLA class II genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is well-established. The identification of non-MHC determinants of MS susceptibility, while progressing, is far from complete. Similar to other complex diseases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to unravel the polygenic etiology of MS. However, variants identified through several large GWAS, to date, explain only a very small proportion of MS heritability. The proposed study describes critical post-GWAS era steps to further our current understanding of MS pathogenesis. First, we will utilize next-generation DNA sequence data, high-throughput genotyping and state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods to fully characterize rare, less frequent and common variants within more than 30 MS genes established through recent GWAS and their contribution to the development of MS and disease expression (Aim 1). Next, we will also comprehensively investigate a number of important life-course exposures including prenatal, perinatal, childhood, adolescent and adult time periods, GxE interactions and risk of MS (Aim 2). Finally, we will study genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a newly established cohort of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)/early MS cases and matched controls to identify immune cell specific epigenetic influences on the development of MS (Aim 3). We will utilize extraordinary MS case-control resources nested within the large, population-based membership of Northern California Kaiser Permanente, as well as DNA, genetic and clinical data assembled for this project through the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium; more than 10,000 individuals of White/European ancestry will be studied using a suite of statistical methods of analysis. Results from proposed epidemiologic studies of the most important MS genes and causal variants in the context of relevant environmental exposures will inform new functional studies, and have potential to support the development of more effective approaches for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The complete identification of genetic and environmental influences and how they contribute independently and jointly to the development of MS and expression of particular disease characteristics would play a major role in understanding disease etiology, and would contribute greatly to disease prevention strategies and development of targeted and more effective therapies.            The complete identification of genetic and environmental influences and how

"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.              The identification of novel

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. This proposal seeks to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. This technology will be employed to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  Studies here will focus on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from a collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. The hypothesis to be tested is that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood.  Two potential modifiers will be examined: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress will be tested by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the ETC. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, once can begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.              Public Health Relevance/",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8218308,R01ES020819,"['Vitamin A Deficiency ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' Fumarates ', ' pollutant ', ' protein mis-folding ', ' pathologic protein folding ', ' abnormal protein folding ', ' aberrant protein folding ', ' protein misfolding ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' Genetically Engineered Mouse ', ' Vitamin A ', ' nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcohol induced steatohepatitis ', ' NASH ', ' nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' Body Fluids ', ' toxicant ', ' transcriptomics ', ' human population study ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Respiration ', ' environmental stressor ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine ', ' gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly ', ' Glycine, N-(N-L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl)- ', ' Glutathione ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Hypoxia ', ' mitochondrial dysfunction ', ' Harvest ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' Dose ', ' base ', ' Lipids ', ' Steroid Compound ', ' Steroids ', ' in vivo ', ' Staging ', ' Technology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Genetic ', ' Population ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Succinates ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Work ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' extracellular ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Metabolic ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Characteristics ', ' Stress ', ' high risk ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Genomics ', ' Resolution ', ' hepatic steatosis ', ' Liver Steatosis ', ' Fatty Liver ', ' response ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cells ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' Defect ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Exhibits ', ' Physiology ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Data ', ' Length ', ' Complex ', ' Collaborations ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Exposure to ', ' novel ', ' Affect ', ' Time ', ' Clinical ', ' Toxicology ', ' Environment ', ' insight ', ' Distal ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' public health relevance ', ' Population Study ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Organelles ', ' TimeLine ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Charge ', ' Pro-Oxidants ', ' Oxygen Radicals ', ' Active Oxygen ', ' Reactive Oxygen Species ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' statistics ', ' diphenyl ether ', ' phenyl ether ', ' organic acid ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' In Vitro ', ' Modeling ', ' Testing ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Investigation ', ' Generations ', ' Publishing ', ' Methods ', ' Biochemical ', ' Reporting ', ' Transmembrane Potentials ', ' Resting Potentials ', ' Membrane Potentials ', ' mitochondrial disease/disorder ', ' Mitochondrial Disorders ', ' Mitochondrial Diseases ', ' ecological toxicology ', ' environmental toxicology ', ' Purines/Pyrimidines/Nucleotides/Nucleic Acids Metabolism ', ' Nucleotide Synthesis ', ' nucleotide metabolism ', ' ']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2011,395592,0.04355519525804612
"Objective imaging-based assessment of smoking behavior from used filters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate measurement of smoking behaviors and exposures may become critical as FDA implements its authority to regulate tobacco products, and in particular proposes product standards and considers approval of modified risk products. Recently, digital image analysis systems have been developed that can identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters with high accuracy and can also estimate the degree of smoker compensation. There is strong potential for such digital imaging systems to unobtrusively infer a rich set of smoker topography variables as well as a smoker's exposure to toxins. The existing literature base on filter-based assays is growing and points to growing prominence and applicability of these approaches to important research questions. We propose to modify existing analysis systems and conduct a series of studies to test their reliability, validity, and applicability for determining mouth- level cigarette smoke exposure by examining tar stains on cigarette filter butts. The Specific Aims are designed to provide rigorous evaluations of the utility of the systems, from establishing prediction equations using machine-smoked cigarettes to cross- validation in human-smoked samples against other established measures of mouth-level exposure. At the conclusion of this project, we plan to release a validated suite of software to the research community to support external verification of digital image analysis for smoking-related research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Accurately and simply measuring smoking behavior and smoke exposure is important, and digital image analysis systems have been developed that can estimate smoke intake and identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters.

"T1D:Investigating the Gut Microbiome, Urinary Proteome and Metabolome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the loss of function of insulin producing pancreatic cells leading to myriad manifestations of the disease in affected individuals. When left untreated this can lead to death. Many studies have shown that development of the disease is the result of interactions between immunological, genetic, and environmental factors. Although, many environmental factors have been implicated, the mechanisms of involvement or major determinants are yet to be clearly identified. Published studies have suggested that T1D results from environmental triggers acting on genetically susceptible individuals and that microbial infection and their immunological consequences are suspected to take part in the pathogenesis. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the causation of beta-cell damage by microbes. Data from retrospective and prospective epidemiological studies strongly suggest the involvement of enteroviruses in the development of T1D. Altered microbial diversity in the gut microbiota has been shown to trigger an abnormal mucosal immune response to further the progression of T1D. Genetic susceptibility traits for T1D are becoming more numerous, including loci for HLA, insulin, protein tyrosine phosphatase-22, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, the interleukin-2 receptor and C- type lectin. This complexity renders them less desirable as predictive tests. Although genetic susceptibility genes are known to play a substantial role in the development of T1D, cellular changes as well as environmental triggers may serve as excellent, potentially more universal biomarkers for risk assessment. For this study, we propose to analyze blood, stool and urine samples from children and adolescent patient populations who have been recently diagnosed with T1D, their siblings, and at-risk cohorts from the TrialNet network (www.diabetestrialnet.org). We propose to apply high-throughput genomics, proteomics and metabolomics techniques to identify molecular signatures discriminating these cohorts. By deconvolution of high-resolution molecular data, we expect to identify viral-microbial specific correlated patterns of proteins and metabolites. Our aim is to discover and verify candidate biomarkers from a large number of biological constituents; from genomic, proteomic and metabolomic datasets through correlation of host microbiome data and genotype. Our purpose is to advance non-invasive clinical tests by applying novel molecular methods to correlate disease status for early diagnosis and prediction of T1D onset, setting the stage for potential therapies or intervention strategies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The incidence of Type I Diabetes (T1D) has been rising rapidly in children and adolescents over the last 20 years. T1D is an autoimmune disease that occurs when a child's body cannot produce insulin, and genetics as well as environmental factors play a role in the development of this disease. We propose to study the complex interplay of environmental, immunological and genetic factors to discover molecular signatures with a potential to advance clinical diagnosis and therapy at or before the onset of T1D.           The incidence of Type I Diabetes (T1D) has been rising rapidly in children and adolescents over the last 20 years.

"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.

"Objective imaging-based assessment of smoking behavior from used filters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate measurement of smoking behaviors and exposures may become critical as FDA implements its authority to regulate tobacco products, and in particular proposes product standards and considers approval of modified risk products. Recently, digital image analysis systems have been developed that can identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters with high accuracy and can also estimate the degree of smoker compensation. There is strong potential for such digital imaging systems to unobtrusively infer a rich set of smoker topography variables as well as a smoker's exposure to toxins. The existing literature base on filter-based assays is growing and points to growing prominence and applicability of these approaches to important research questions. We propose to modify existing analysis systems and conduct a series of studies to test their reliability, validity, and applicability for determining mouth- level cigarette smoke exposure by examining tar stains on cigarette filter butts. The Specific Aims are designed to provide rigorous evaluations of the utility of the systems, from establishing prediction equations using machine-smoked cigarettes to cross- validation in human-smoked samples against other established measures of mouth-level exposure. At the conclusion of this project, we plan to release a validated suite of software to the research community to support external verification of digital image analysis for smoking-related research.        Accurately and simply measuring smoking behavior and smoke exposure is important, and digital image analysis systems have been developed that can estimate smoke intake and identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters. The proposed project will modify existing analysis systems and conduct a series of studies to test their reliability, validity, and applicability for determining mouth-level cigarette smoke exposure. We plan to make a suite of software publicly available to allow others to apply this technology in their own research.

"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals¿ cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.              Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity.

"Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by myelin loss, varying degrees of axonal pathology, and progressive neurological dysfunction. The combined effect of many genes, environmental exposures acting during defined periods of life, and their interactions in MS is strongly supported by our own work and others. The involvement of HLA class II genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is well-established. The identification of non-MHC determinants of MS susceptibility, while progressing, is far from complete. Similar to other complex diseases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to unravel the polygenic etiology of MS. However, variants identified through several large GWAS, to date, explain only a very small proportion of MS heritability. The proposed study describes critical post-GWAS era steps to further our current understanding of MS pathogenesis. First, we will utilize next-generation DNA sequence data, high-throughput genotyping and state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods to fully characterize rare, less frequent and common variants within more than 30 MS genes established through recent GWAS and their contribution to the development of MS and disease expression (Aim 1). Next, we will also comprehensively investigate a number of important life-course exposures including prenatal, perinatal, childhood, adolescent and adult time periods, GxE interactions and risk of MS (Aim 2). Finally, we will study genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a newly established cohort of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)/early MS cases and matched controls to identify immune cell specific epigenetic influences on the development of MS (Aim 3). We will utilize extraordinary MS case-control resources nested within the large, population-based membership of Northern California Kaiser Permanente, as well as DNA, genetic and clinical data assembled for this project through the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium; more than 10,000 individuals of White/European ancestry will be studied using a suite of statistical methods of analysis. Results from proposed epidemiologic studies of the most important MS genes and causal variants in the context of relevant environmental exposures will inform new functional studies, and have potential to support the development of more effective approaches for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.         The complete identification of genetic and environmental influences and how they contribute independently and jointly to the development of MS and expression of particular disease characteristics would play a major role in understanding disease etiology, and would contribute greatly to disease prevention strategies and development of targeted and more effective therapies.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.  Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations.

"A New Approach to Compute PM2.5 for Health Impact Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental air quality impacts human well-being and disease, but the availability of air quality data is limited to selected locations because of the complexity involved in its measurement. Among air pollutants, PM2.5 is of the greatest concern. These particles are not captured by the lungs' natural defenses and can be inhaled deeply, where they can cause health problems ranging from asthma attacks to heart disease.  PM2.5 currently is measured primarily by ground monitoring stations located at approximately 320 EPA sites, providing limited local geographic coverage. However, there are satellites that make a variety of aerosol observations and provide a daily global picture of atmospheric particulates in the form of aerosol optical depth (AOD). Scientists have attempted to compute ground-level PM2.5 (GLP) from these AOD data. However, the multivariate nonlinear relationship between AOD and PM2.5 imposes limitations in computing GLP using satellite data. This project proposes to overcome these limitations by computing reliable GLP via a new methodology which has already been tested and validated.  The study has two specific aims: (1) develop satellite-derived daily GLP estimates for the contiguous U.S., and (2) examine spatial and temporal associations between GLP exposure and hospital visits for asthma exacerbation in Mississippi. Using our methodology, we will generate daily GLP data for a 12-month period at a resolution of 0.10x0.10 (~10x10km2), providing approximately 82,000 data points as opposed to about 300 data points available daily from EPA ground monitoring stations within the contiguous U.S. We will address the nonlinear relationship between PM2.5 and AOD which is a function of humidity, temperature, surface pressure, surface wind speed, surface type, boundary layer height, and AOD by accounting for these variables using a machine learning process. The AOD that will be used in this process will be generated by merging AOD data from multiple satellite sensors. Meteorological data will come from NOAA NCEP. Surface type data will be obtained from the satellite-identified vegetation index. Boundary layer height, which is the mixed layer of the atmosphere closest to the ground where people live and work, will come from CALIPSO data which provides vertical profiles of atmospheric aerosol extinction.  Information on GLP levels will allow the scientific community to better understand health impacts from exposure to low, moderate, or high levels of PM2.5. Moreover, in places where PM2.5 levels are elevated only occasionally, such as Mississippi, the short-term health impact of increases in PM2.5 can be studied more precisely. National GLP data will be made available to other researchers to facilitate future explorations of how PM2.5 exposure impacts a wide range of health conditions, thereby making possible more timely prophylactic treatment, improving healthcare system preparedness, and better informing public health policymaking.          Among air pollutants, particulates 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller (PM2.5) have the greatest impact on human health because they are small enough to be inhaled deeply into the lungs, making allergies, asthma, and other respiratory conditions worse. The proposed study will provide daily estimates of ground-level PM2.5 for the entire contiguous U.S. so that researchers can study how it affects disease at various locations in the country. The knowledge that results can be used to better inform people about the links between air pollution and disease, and to guide the development of air quality standards to improve public health.

"Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by myelin loss, varying degrees of axonal pathology, and progressive neurological dysfunction. The combined effect of many genes, environmental exposures acting during defined periods of life, and their interactions in MS is strongly supported by our own work and others. The involvement of HLA class II genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is well-established. The identification of non-MHC determinants of MS susceptibility, while progressing, is far from complete. Similar to other complex diseases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to unravel the polygenic etiology of MS. However, variants identified through several large GWAS, to date, explain only a very small proportion of MS heritability. The proposed study describes critical post-GWAS era steps to further our current understanding of MS pathogenesis. First, we will utilize next-generation DNA sequence data, high-throughput genotyping and state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods to fully characterize rare, less frequent and common variants within more than 30 MS genes established through recent GWAS and their contribution to the development of MS and disease expression (Aim 1). Next, we will also comprehensively investigate a number of important life-course exposures including prenatal, perinatal, childhood, adolescent and adult time periods, GxE interactions and risk of MS (Aim 2). Finally, we will study genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a newly established cohort of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)/early MS cases and matched controls to identify immune cell specific epigenetic influences on the development of MS (Aim 3). We will utilize extraordinary MS case-control resources nested within the large, population-based membership of Northern California Kaiser Permanente, as well as DNA, genetic and clinical data assembled for this project through the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium; more than 10,000 individuals of White/European ancestry will be studied using a suite of statistical methods of analysis. Results from proposed epidemiologic studies of the most important MS genes and causal variants in the context of relevant environmental exposures will inform new functional studies, and have potential to support the development of more effective approaches for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.         The complete identification of genetic and environmental influences and how they contribute independently and jointly to the development of MS and expression of particular disease characteristics would play a major role in understanding disease etiology, and would contribute greatly to disease prevention strategies and development of targeted and more effective therapies.

"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.  Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8484404,R01ES020819,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Body Fluids ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' Charge ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electron transfer ', ' Electron Transport ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' hepatic steatosis ', ' Liver Steatosis ', ' Fatty Liver ', ' Fumarates ', ' gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine ', ' gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly ', ' Glycine, N-(N-L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl)- ', ' Glutathione ', ' Goals ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lipids ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Transmembrane Potentials ', ' Resting Potentials ', ' Membrane Potentials ', ' Methods ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Organelles ', ' Physiology ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Respiration ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' statistics ', ' Steroid Compound ', ' Steroids ', ' Stress ', ' Succinates ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Vitamin A ', ' Vitamin A Deficiency ', ' Work ', ' diphenyl ether ', ' phenyl ether ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' TimeLine ', ' Pro-Oxidants ', ' Oxygen Radicals ', ' Active Oxygen ', ' Reactive Oxygen Species ', ' base ', ' ecological toxicology ', ' environmental toxicology ', ' human population study ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' organic acid ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' extracellular ', ' environmental stressor ', ' Purines/Pyrimidines/Nucleotides/Nucleic Acids Metabolism ', ' Nucleotide Synthesis ', ' nucleotide metabolism ', ' pollutant ', ' toxicant ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' mitochondrial disease/disorder ', ' Mitochondrial Disorders ', ' Mitochondrial Diseases ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Characteristics ', ' Genetically Engineered Mouse ', ' protein mis-folding ', ' pathologic protein folding ', ' abnormal protein folding ', ' aberrant protein folding ', ' protein misfolding ', ' Population ', ' Metabolic stress ', ' transcriptomics ', ' mitochondrial dysfunction ', ' nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcohol induced steatohepatitis ', ' NASH ', ' nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2013,370345,0.0453592317441372
"Genome Wide Association Study of Head and Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers have well-documented associations with tobacco and alcohol exposure, but the disease develops in only a small fraction of users, which implies an important role for genetic susceptibility. Therefore, head and neck cancers are an excellent model for studying genetic susceptibility to environmental carcinogens. The primary goal of this R01 application is to perform a comprehensive two-stage, high-density, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of head and neck cancer cases and corresponding frequency matched controls to identify novel genetic risk factors for head and neck cancer. This proposal builds upon a well-annotated existing DNA repository of cases and controls. One of the unique features of our study is the availability of DNA repair assay data on most of the cases and controls in this study, which will allow us to conduct genotype/phenotype analyses. We also have access to genome-wide association data from 1200 white control subjects from the same source population. In aim 1, we will perform genotyping on 1000 randomly selected head and neck cancer cases and 500 controls using a 370K Illumina Infinium HapMap HumanCNV370-Duo SNP Chip. We will perform association analyses (1000 cases and 1700 controls) in the first stage using outcome variable as case-control status as well as DNA repair capacity assay data. Our second aim is to perform second-stage analysis of the SNPs selected in stage 1 using 900 additional cases and corresponding controls from the same source and from UCLA. We will use efficient joint analysis of cases and controls from the first and second aims, for a total of 1900 cases and 2600 controls. Finally, in aim 3, we will apply novel statistical tools such as the latent variable approach with Tukey's one-degree-of-freedom test and support vector machines to identify gene-gene and gene-environment (using environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol use) interactions that contribute to the risk of head and neck cancer. We are an experienced investigative team proposing a comprehensive analysis that incorporates epidemiological, behavioral, and functional data. Identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of head and neck cancers.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The identification of novel genetic risk factors and their interactions with environmental factors will contribute to the early diagnosis of the disease and help identify individuals at highest risk for the development of head and neck cancer on the basis of their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles.

"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking.  Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (principal investigator) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting-edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals.  By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 application builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health.  In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study.  Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities.         Public Health Relevance: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking.  Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This application will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.                ","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",8566379,K99ES022986,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Body Burden ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Cities ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Italy ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mentorship ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Mexico ', ' Nails ', ' Nail plate ', ' Neurology ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Measures ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' forest ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' Perinatal Exposure ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' Instruction ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' lead exposure ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' exposure to metal ', ' Metal exposure ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 4 year old ', ' seven year old ', ' age 7 years ', ' 7 year old ', ' thirteen year old ', ' age 13 years ', ' 13 year old ', ' analytical tool ', ' neurotoxic ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' public health priorities ', ' longitudinal design ', ' early life exposure ', ' ']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2013,102242,0.08855740927593386
"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies.          Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals� cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.

"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Where people spend their time during the day may be related to their risk of getting cancer. Previous studies have only looked at places near to home. This project will assess behaviors in different locations across the day and relate exposure to different environments to biological outcomes such as insulin resistance.                ",(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk,8590146,R01CA179977,"['Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Devices ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' land use ', ' Sampling ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Text ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' television watching ', ' screen time ', ' tv watching ', ' Outcome ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' learning behavior ', ' learned behavior ', ' food environment ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Buffers ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Food ', ' Health ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Inflammation ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Insulin (ox), 8A-L-threonine-10A-L-isoleucine-30B-L-threonine- ', ' Humulin R ', ' Insulin ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Interleukin 6 (Interferon, Beta 2) ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 (B cell stimulating factor 2) ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Recreation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Seasons ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Weight ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' density ', ' sedentary ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Physical activity ', ' residence ', ' sugar ', ' self knowledge ', ' self awareness ', ' Self view ', ' Self image ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Self Perception ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Exposure to ', ' convenience food ', ' fast food ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' calorie (nutrition) ', ' Calories ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Healthy diet ', ' Diet good ', ' Physical Function ', ' cancer risk ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2013,733604,0.08968078108368226
"Genetic Susceptibility and Risk Model for Pancreatic Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer (PanC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women in the U.S. Better understanding of the etiology and developing risk prediction models for early detection and prevention are urgently needed for this rapidly fatal disease. The majority of PanC are caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors. Known risk factors for PanC include cigarette smoking, obesity, long-term type II diabetes, and family history. In addition, our previous case-control study has shown that excess body mass index (BMI) in young adulthood confers a higher risk of PanC than weight gain at later age. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several chromosomal regions and genes in association with risk of PanC (PanScan). Our pathway analyses of the PanScan GWAS data have uncovered several novel biological pathways associated with the risk for PanC. However, it remains unknown how environmental or host risk factors modify the association between genetic factors and the PanC risk, which knowledge is critical to better understanding of the etiology and developing a risk prediction model and early intervention strategies for PanC. The goal of this project is to identify gene-environment interactions and develop and validate a risk prediction model including both common and rare genetic variants using the PanScan GWAS data and the exposure information of over 2,200 case-control pairs and an ongoing ExomeChip-based study of PanC genotyping both common SNPs and >240,000 rare functional exonic variants in over 4,100 cases and 4,700 controls from six case-control studies in the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4) and a nested case-control study from Europe (EPIC). We will validate the absolute risk prediction model in two large prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort of 15,000 individuals and the Kaiser Permanente cohort of 100,000 individuals. We will also develop novel statistical methods to identify genes modifying the association between changing BMI at different age periods and PanC risk using the unique dataset from a case-control study of PanC conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Our proposed project hinges on novel integration of GWAS, ExomeChip, exposure data of a large number of PanC cases and controls, recently developed powerful statistical methods and analysis strategies for detecting genome-wide gene/pathway-environment interactions and polygenic approaches to genetic risk prediction. The work proposed here is expected not only to advance our understanding of the etiology of PanC and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of PanC, but also to greatly facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, improved survival and prevention of PanC. The novel statistical methods developed here are also applicable to other cancers and complex disease, and we will develop user-friendly software packages for public use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 43,900 new cases of pancreatic cancer are expected to occur in the US in 2012, almost all rapidly fatal.

"Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by myelin loss, varying degrees of axonal pathology, and progressive neurological dysfunction. The combined effect of many genes, environmental exposures acting during defined periods of life, and their interactions in MS is strongly supported by our own work and others. The involvement of HLA class II genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is well-established. The identification of non-MHC determinants of MS susceptibility, while progressing, is far from complete. Similar to other complex diseases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to unravel the polygenic etiology of MS. However, variants identified through several large GWAS, to date, explain only a very small proportion of MS heritability. The proposed study describes critical post-GWAS era steps to further our current understanding of MS pathogenesis. First, we will utilize next-generation DNA sequence data, high-throughput genotyping and state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods to fully characterize rare, less frequent and common variants within more than 30 MS genes established through recent GWAS and their contribution to the development of MS and disease expression (Aim 1). Next, we will also comprehensively investigate a number of important life-course exposures including prenatal, perinatal, childhood, adolescent and adult time periods, GxE interactions and risk of MS (Aim 2). Finally, we will study genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a newly established cohort of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)/early MS cases and matched controls to identify immune cell specific epigenetic influences on the development of MS (Aim 3). We will utilize extraordinary MS case-control resources nested within the large, population-based membership of Northern California Kaiser Permanente, as well as DNA, genetic and clinical data assembled for this project through the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium; more than 10,000 individuals of White/European ancestry will be studied using a suite of statistical methods of analysis. Results from proposed epidemiologic studies of the most important MS genes and causal variants in the context of relevant environmental exposures will inform new functional studies, and have potential to support the development of more effective approaches for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.         The complete identification of genetic and environmental influences and how they contribute independently and jointly to the development of MS and expression of particular disease characteristics would play a major role in understanding disease etiology, and would contribute greatly to disease prevention strategies and development of targeted and more effective therapies.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.  Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8691819,R01ES020819,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Body Fluids ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' Charge ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electron transfer ', ' Electron Transport ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' hepatic steatosis ', ' Liver Steatosis ', ' Fatty Liver ', ' Fumarates ', ' gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine ', ' gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly ', ' Glycine, N-(N-L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl)- ', ' Glutathione ', ' Goals ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lipids ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Transmembrane Potentials ', ' Resting Potentials ', ' Membrane Potentials ', ' Methods ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Organelles ', ' Physiology ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Respiration ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' statistics ', ' Steroid Compound ', ' Steroids ', ' Stress ', ' Succinates ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Vitamin A ', ' Vitamin A Deficiency ', ' Work ', ' diphenyl ether ', ' phenyl ether ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' TimeLine ', ' Pro-Oxidants ', ' Oxygen Radicals ', ' Active Oxygen ', ' Reactive Oxygen Species ', ' base ', ' ecological toxicology ', ' environmental toxicology ', ' human population study ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' organic acid ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' extracellular ', ' environmental stressor ', ' Purines/Pyrimidines/Nucleotides/Nucleic Acids Metabolism ', ' Nucleotide Synthesis ', ' nucleotide metabolism ', ' pollutant ', ' toxicant ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' mitochondrial disease/disorder ', ' Mitochondrial Disorders ', ' Mitochondrial Diseases ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Characteristics ', ' Genetically Engineered Mouse ', ' protein mis-folding ', ' pathologic protein folding ', ' abnormal protein folding ', ' aberrant protein folding ', ' protein misfolding ', ' Population ', ' Metabolic stress ', ' transcriptomics ', ' mitochondrial dysfunction ', ' nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcohol induced steatohepatitis ', ' NASH ', ' nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2014,373821,0.0453592317441372
"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Where people spend their time during the day may be related to their risk of getting cancer. Previous studies have only looked at places near to home. This project will assess behaviors in different locations across the day and relate exposure to different environments to biological outcomes such as insulin resistance.",(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk,8722512,R01CA179977,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Buffers ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Food ', ' Health ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Inflammation ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Insulin (ox), 8A-L-threonine-10A-L-isoleucine-30B-L-threonine- ', ' Humulin R ', ' Insulin ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Interleukin 6 (Interferon, Beta 2) ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 (B cell stimulating factor 2) ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Recreation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Seasons ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Weight ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' density ', ' sedentary ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Physical activity ', ' residence ', ' sugar ', ' self knowledge ', ' self awareness ', ' Self view ', ' Self image ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Self Perception ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Exposure to ', ' convenience food ', ' fast food ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' calorie (nutrition) ', ' Calories ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Healthy diet ', ' good diet ', ' Diet good ', ' Physical Function ', ' cancer risk ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Devices ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' land use ', ' Sampling ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Text ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' television watching ', ' screen time ', ' tv watching ', ' Outcome ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' learning behavior ', ' learned behavior ', ' food environment ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,715557,0.08968078108368226
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking.  Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (principal investigator) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting-edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals.  By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 application builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health.  In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study.  Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities.         Public Health Relevance: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking.  Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This application will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.

"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.

"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies.          Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals� cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.

"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans.

"Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a four-year study of cognitive markers of late-life suicide. Our overarching goal is to find factors predictive of high-lethality suicidal behavior in late life. Extending the stress-diathesis model, our research program seeks to understand how trait-like diatheses - impaired cognitive control, deficits in social processing, and impulsivity - are expressed in poor decisions, both in experimental paradigms and in the context of real-world decision making. Our current cross-sectional study focuses on cognitive correlates of late-life suicidal behavior, linking it to poor cognitive contro. Adding to a growing body of evidence, we have preliminary evidence that older suicide attempters are impaired in their decision-making. Further, we have important clues about dimensions of heterogeneity in suicidal behavior. We see that high-lethality suicide attempters struggle in complex environments and make poor social decisions. By contrast, we see a tendency toward short-sighted decisions falling under the broad category of impulsivity in people with low-lethality and unplanned suicide attempts. The proposed study examines the cognitive and neural underpinnings of disadvantageous decisions in individuals with high-lethality attempts. We propose to (i) relate cognitive control deficits to poor decision-making in complex, ambiguous environments in older suicide attempters, (ii) to describe neural system alterations that may underlie poor cognitive control and disadvantageous decisions, (iii) to extend our investigations to poor social decisions that may contribute to late-life suicidal behavior, and (iv to develop an algorithm for predicting suicide risk that incorporates these features in addition to established risk factors. These goals will be accomplished by two interlinked studies. Study I is a cross-sectional, case- control comparison of 70 high-lethality suicide attempters, 70 low-lethality suicide attempters, 70 non-suicidal depressed, and 50 non-psychiatric controls. We focus on older suicide attempters, as suicide rates are high in old age and because late-life suicide attempts, due to their serious and determined nature, offer a window into death by suicide. Study I will use a framework that combines behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience, with multilevel clinical, behavioral, cognitive, and imaging assessments. Our sampling and assessment strategy was designed with particular attention to possible confounders. Study II will follow 250 older suicide attempters (110 enrolled to date + 140 newly recruited) for up to 4 years, capturing recurrent attempts. It will serve as a prospective validatin of our predictive model. The extensive clinical and behavioral/cognitive characterization combined with a machine learning approach will allow us to develop an algorithm for suicide risk prediction which can inform clinical practice. The investigative team includes experts in reward learning and model-based imaging (Dombrovski), geriatric neuroimaging (Aizeinstein), behavioral economics (De Bruine), analysis of neural and longitudinal data (Weissfield), decision neuroscience (Clark), neuropsychology of suicide (Keilp) and of geriatric depression (Butters).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, about 6000 people aged 65 and older die by suicide in the US, with non-fatal suicide attempts numbering at least 2-4 times as many; however, clinicians lack tools for identifying those at risk and targeted treatments. Suicide follows a decision process, and recent studies have shown that suicidal individuals are often bad at making decisions in other situations; this study specifically explores patterns of decision-making seen in older people with near-lethal suicide attempts.            ",Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide,8630165,R01MH085651,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Butter ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Economics ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Gambling ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' Patients ', ' Punishment ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' K18 combination ', ' K18 ', ' K-18 ', ' K-18 conjugate ', ' falls ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' preference ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' social ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' comparison group ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' geriatric depression ', ' cost ', ' neglect ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Affective ', ' neuropsychological ', ' suicidal individual ', ' suicide attempter ', ' BOLD response ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent response ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,496314,0.123111182445826
"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows Abstract: Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking. Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (PI) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals. By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 proposal builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health. In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study. Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities. Narrative: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking. Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This proposal will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",8992934,R00ES022986,"['abstracting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Body Burden ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Cities ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Italy ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mentorship ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Mexico ', ' Nails ', ' Nail plate ', ' Neurology ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Measures ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' forest ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' Perinatal Exposure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' Instruction ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' lead exposure ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' exposure to metal ', ' Metal exposure ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 4 year old ', ' seven year old ', ' age 7 years ', ' 7 year old ', ' thirteen year old ', ' age 13 years ', ' 13 year old ', ' analytical tool ', ' neurotoxic ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' public health priorities ', ' longitudinal design ', ' early life exposure ', ' ']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R00,2015,248999,0.08855740927593386

These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is a near universal exposure that is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. The goal of this study is to identify airway gene expression changes due to chronic high endotoxin exposure in inner city schools and textile mills, and to determine whether these gene expression changes can identify important mechanisms of disease and serve as a clinically useful biomarker for important asthma and COPD subtypes.","Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease",8852128,K23ES023700,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Bronchi ', ' Burns ', ' Burn injury ', ' cotton mill fever ', ' cotton dust asthma ', ' Cotton mill asthma ', ' Byssinosis ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Closed Cohort Studies ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' cotton ', ' Cotton Plant ', ' Gossypium ', ' Critical Care ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Endotoxins ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Equipment ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Gram-Negative Bacteria ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitalization ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' COAD ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Respiratory System, Nose, Nasal Passages ', ' Nasal Passages Nose ', ' Nasal ', ' Nose ', ' Obstruction ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Emphysema ', ' Pulmonary Emphysema ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Smoking ', ' sound ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' fabric ', ' Textiles ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computerized Axial Tomography (Computerized Tomography) ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Silk ', ' Measures ', ' Indoor Air Pollution ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Exposure to ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Tobacco smoke ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Occupational ', ' respiratory ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' American ', ' elementary school ', ' experience ', ' Nasal Epithelium ', ' bronchial epithelium ', ' cohort ', ' attenuation ', ' respiratory airway obstruction ', ' obstructive lung disease (generalized) ', ' obstructive airway disease ', ' Obstructive Lung Diseases ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' Chest ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' Genomics ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Institution ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' microarray technology ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' Symptoms ', ' Consent ', ' M.P.H.

"Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a four-year study of cognitive markers of late-life suicide. Our overarching goal is to find factors predictive of high-lethality suicidal behavior in late life. Extending the stress-diathesis model, our research program seeks to understand how trait-like diatheses - impaired cognitive control, deficits in social processing, and impulsivity - are expressed in poor decisions, both in experimental paradigms and in the context of real-world decision making. Our current cross-sectional study focuses on cognitive correlates of late-life suicidal behavior, linking it to poor cognitive contro. Adding to a growing body of evidence, we have preliminary evidence that older suicide attempters are impaired in their decision-making. Further, we have important clues about dimensions of heterogeneity in suicidal behavior. We see that high-lethality suicide attempters struggle in complex environments and make poor social decisions. By contrast, we see a tendency toward short-sighted decisions falling under the broad category of impulsivity in people with low-lethality and unplanned suicide attempts. The proposed study examines the cognitive and neural underpinnings of disadvantageous decisions in individuals with high-lethality attempts. We propose to (i) relate cognitive control deficits to poor decision-making in complex, ambiguous environments in older suicide attempters, (ii) to describe neural system alterations that may underlie poor cognitive control and disadvantageous decisions, (iii) to extend our investigations to poor social decisions that may contribute to late-life suicidal behavior, and (iv to develop an algorithm for predicting suicide risk that incorporates these features in addition to established risk factors. These goals will be accomplished by two interlinked studies. Study I is a cross-sectional, case- control comparison of 70 high-lethality suicide attempters, 70 low-lethality suicide attempters, 70 non-suicidal depressed, and 50 non-psychiatric controls. We focus on older suicide attempters, as suicide rates are high in old age and because late-life suicide attempts, due to their serious and determined nature, offer a window into death by suicide. Study I will use a framework that combines behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience, with multilevel clinical, behavioral, cognitive, and imaging assessments. Our sampling and assessment strategy was designed with particular attention to possible confounders. Study II will follow 250 older suicide attempters (110 enrolled to date + 140 newly recruited) for up to 4 years, capturing recurrent attempts. It will serve as a prospective validatin of our predictive model. The extensive clinical and behavioral/cognitive characterization combined with a machine learning approach will allow us to develop an algorithm for suicide risk prediction which can inform clinical practice. The investigative team includes experts in reward learning and model-based imaging (Dombrovski), geriatric neuroimaging (Aizeinstein), behavioral economics (De Bruine), analysis of neural and longitudinal data (Weissfield), decision neuroscience (Clark), neuropsychology of suicide (Keilp) and of geriatric depression (Butters). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, about 6000 people aged 65 and older die by suicide in the US, with non-fatal suicide attempts numbering at least 2-4 times as many; however, clinicians lack tools for identifying those at risk and targeted treatments. Suicide follows a decision process, and recent studies have shown that suicidal individuals are often bad at making decisions in other situations; this study specifically explores patterns of decision-making seen in older people with near-lethal suicide attempts.",Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide,8914669,R01MH085651,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Butter ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Gambling ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' Patients ', ' Punishment ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' K18 combination ', ' K18 ', ' K-18 ', ' K-18 conjugate ', ' falls ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' preference ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' social ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' comparison group ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' geriatric depression ', ' cost ', ' neglect ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Affective ', ' neuropsychological ', ' suicidal individual ', ' suicide attempter ', ' BOLD response ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent response ', ' cognitive control ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,490410,0.123111182445826

"Genetic Susceptibility and Risk Model for Pancreatic Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer (PanC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women in the U.S. Better understanding of the etiology and developing risk prediction models for early detection and prevention are urgently needed for this rapidly fatal disease. The majority of PanC are caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors. Known risk factors for PanC include cigarette smoking, obesity, long-term type II diabetes, and family history. In addition, our previous case-control study has shown that excess body mass index (BMI) in young adulthood confers a higher risk of PanC than weight gain at later age. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several chromosomal regions and genes in association with risk of PanC (PanScan). Our pathway analyses of the PanScan GWAS data have uncovered several novel biological pathways associated with the risk for PanC. However, it remains unknown how environmental or host risk factors modify the association between genetic factors and the PanC risk, which knowledge is critical to better understanding of the etiology and developing a risk prediction model and early intervention strategies for PanC. The goal of this project is to identify gene-environment interactions and develop and validate a risk prediction model including both common and rare genetic variants using the PanScan GWAS data and the exposure information of over 2,200 case-control pairs and an ongoing ExomeChip-based study of PanC genotyping both common SNPs and >240,000 rare functional exonic variants in over 4,100 cases and 4,700 controls from six case-control studies in the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4) and a nested case-control study from Europe (EPIC). We will validate the absolute risk prediction model in two large prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort of 15,000 individuals and the Kaiser Permanente cohort of 100,000 individuals. We will also develop novel statistical methods to identify genes modifying the association between changing BMI at different age periods and PanC risk using the unique dataset from a case-control study of PanC conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Our proposed project hinges on novel integration of GWAS, ExomeChip, exposure data of a large number of PanC cases and controls, recently developed powerful statistical methods and analysis strategies for detecting genome-wide gene/pathway-environment interactions and polygenic approaches to genetic risk prediction. The work proposed here is expected not only to advance our understanding of the etiology of PanC and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of PanC, but also to greatly facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, improved survival and prevention of PanC. The novel statistical methods developed here are also applicable to other cancers and complex disease, and we will develop user-friendly software packages for public use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 43,900 new cases of pancreatic cancer are expected to occur in the US in 2012, almost all rapidly fatal. This project will not only advance our understanding of the etiology of pancreatic cancer and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of pancreatic cancer, but also will facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, prevention, and improved survival of pancreatic cancer.

"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI's second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies. Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals' cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.",A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk,8876609,R01CA170508,"['Algorithms ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Migrant ', ' Nomads ', ' Mining ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Medical History ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' environmental carcinogenesis ', ' meetings ', ' age group ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Informatics ', ' high-end computing ', ' High Performance Computing ', ' population migration ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Environmental Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Environmental Cancer ', ' Environment-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' environment related cancer ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' cancer epidemiology ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' Individual Cancer History ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' data acquisition ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' social networking web site ', ' social networking site ', ' social networking website ', ' internet security ', ' cybersecurity ', ' cyber security ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' ']",NCI,"UT-BATTELLE, LLC-OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LAB",R01,2015,392385,0.07391629363354164
"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology. Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8874981,R01ES020819,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Bioenergetics ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Body Fluids ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' Charge ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electron transfer ', ' Electron Transport ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' hepatic steatosis ', ' Liver Steatosis ', ' Fatty Liver ', ' Fumarates ', ' gamma-L-Glutamyl-L-Cysteinylglycine ', ' gamma-L-Glu-L-Cys-Gly ', ' Glycine, N-(N-L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl)- ', ' Glutathione ', ' Goals ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lipids ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' Transmembrane Potentials ', ' Resting Potentials ', ' Membrane Potentials ', ' Methods ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Organelles ', ' Physiology ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' respiratory mechanism ', ' Respiration ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' statistics ', ' Steroid Compound ', ' Steroids ', ' Stress ', ' Succinates ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Vitamin A ', ' Vitamin A Deficiency ', ' Work ', ' diphenyl ether ', ' phenyl ether ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' TimeLine ', ' Pro-Oxidants ', ' Oxygen Radicals ', ' Active Oxygen ', ' Reactive Oxygen Species ', ' base ', ' ecological toxicology ', ' environmental toxicology ', ' human population study ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' Chemicals ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' organic acid ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' extracellular ', ' environmental stressor ', ' Purines/Pyrimidines/Nucleotides/Nucleic Acids Metabolism ', ' Nucleotide Synthesis ', ' nucleotide metabolism ', ' pollutant ', ' toxicant ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' mitochondrial disease/disorder ', ' Mitochondrial Disorders ', ' Mitochondrial Diseases ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Characteristics ', ' Genetically Engineered Mouse ', ' protein mis-folding ', ' pathologic protein folding ', ' abnormal protein folding ', ' aberrant protein folding ', ' protein misfolding ', ' Population ', ' Metabolic stress ', ' transcriptomics ', ' mitochondrial dysfunction ', ' nonalcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis ', ' non-alcohol induced steatohepatitis ', ' NASH ', ' nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2015,377291,0.0453592317441372
"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Smoking is a major cause of health disparities, and socioeconomic status (SES) is strongly associated with lower rates of smoking cessation. Several major conceptual models have been proposed that share a key, common mechanism linking SES to health behaviors such as cessation, noting that the life circumstances associated with low SES lead to greater exposure to stress, which then influences behavior. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among low SES individuals is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of SES and social history, contextual and environmental influences, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, and acute momentary precipitants on stress, smoking lapse, and abstinence among 300 smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed using real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of Autosense, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and geographic positioning system (GPS). Autosense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or encounters a stressor. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse and stress ascertained in real time through Autosense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is the first study to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by low SES individuals.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of socioeconomic status, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, context/environment, and acute precipitants on stress, smoking lapse, and abstinence among 300 smokers attempting to quit.                ","Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation",8965058,R01CA190329,"['Affect ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Health behavior ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Motivation ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Poverty ', ' Real-Time Systems ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Abstinence ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' mindfulness ', ' distress tolerance ', ' social health determinants ', ' ']",NCI,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,665384,-0.01312639129495598
"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,8832593,P30ES006096,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Arteries ', ' Attention ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Equipment ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Genome Project ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Neurology ', ' Ohio ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Power Plants ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Transportation ', ' Identical Twins ', ' Monozygotic twins ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' malignant endocrine gland tumor ', ' Malignant Endocrine Tumor ', ' Malignant Endocrine Neoplasm ', ' Endocrine Gland Cancer ', ' Endocrine Cancer ', ' malignant endocrine gland neoplasm ', ' lipid disorder ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' environmental agent ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Route ', ' experience ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' health science research ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' member ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Dose ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Core Facility ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Update ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Basis of Adult Disease ', ' FeBAD ', ' Barker Hypothesis ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' human capital ', ' endocrine disrupting ', ' Endocrine disruption ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' Allergic Disease ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' epigenome ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2015,2296162,0.1091726280590002
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Where people spend their time during the day may be related to their risk of getting cancer. Previous studies have only looked at places near to home.

"Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology shows promise by allowing designers to specifically select unique combinations of material properties as needed increasing the effectiveness of applications in medicine, coatings, lubrication, semiconductors, composites, and many others. These materials with their unique combinations of properties on exposure to humans may result in unanticipated hazards, however, putting workers in nanotechnology-related industries at risk. Traditional animal testing is expensive and too slow to evaluate potential risks for the current pace of new nanomaterial development. Both technology developers and regulators need more rapid methods to evaluate new nanomaterial configurations for their risk potential. Much hope is placed in high-throughput in vitro screening assays, but the relevance of these results to the potential for human disease or even the observed toxic effects in animal exposures is unclear. Some research has proposed Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) to predict in vitro nanomaterial toxicity in a few specific assays, but the applicability of these models to a wider group of materials, alternative in vitro assays, or in vivo toxicity has not been explored. If the primary exposure pathway for workers in the near term is inhalation, which in vitro assays will provide the most reliable risk information for that scenario? Two recently available data sources will permit this study to investigate this question: the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast data for nanomaterials and the Nanomaterial Pulmonary Toxicity Database (NTDB), a collection of published peer reviewed studies observing pulmonary inflammation in rodents upon exposures to nanomaterials. This study will pursue the following specific aims: (1.) identify combinations of in vitro assay results that can reliably forecast the results of pulmonary inflammation results in rodents; (2.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to a wider array of in vitro toxicity assays; and (3.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to in vivo pulmonary inflammation results. This study will employ machine learning methods to cluster similar nanomaterials between the various in vitro and in vivo results, and to identify combinations of in vitro assays that rank order the toxicity of nanomaterials most similarly to pulmonary inflammation results in rodents considering also how changes in specific chemical and physical particle properties exacerbate or mitigate observed toxicity. This study addresses documented research needs in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) cross- sector Nanotechnology program including specific goals in the Human Health and Informatics categories. Implementation complies with the Research to Practice (r2p) Initiative in its formulation, design, and implementation plan including industry an public outreach. The insight generated by this study will improve nanomaterial risk screening capabilities and focus attention and effort on those measurements and techniques proven to be most effective and reliable enabling better management and control of the risks faced by workers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although toxicity risk information for nanoparticles is accumulating rapidly, the development of new nanomaterial configurations is proceeding too fast for our best risk assessment tools (i.e. animal testing) to keep up. The new availability of two large databases of in vitro assay results and pulmonary inflammation results in rodents will permit this study to investigate which in vitro assays provide the most predictive information about the results from in vivo exposures, and thus speed up the risk screening process for nanomaterials. The results of this study will have important implications for more quickly identifying new nanomaterial-related risks to workers.            ",Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles,8953935,R03OH010956,[''],NIOSH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2015,66904,0.016795983185799977

The identification of non-MHC determinants of MS susceptibility, while progressing, is far from complete. Similar to other complex diseases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to unravel the polygenic etiology of MS. However, variants identified through several large GWAS, to date, explain only a very small proportion of MS heritability. The proposed study describes critical post-GWAS era steps to further our current understanding of MS pathogenesis. First, we will utilize next-generation DNA sequence data, high-throughput genotyping and state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods to fully characterize rare, less frequent and common variants within more than 30 MS genes established through recent GWAS and their contribution to the development of MS and disease expression (Aim 1). Next, we will also comprehensively investigate a number of important life-course exposures including prenatal, perinatal, childhood, adolescent and adult time periods, GxE interactions and risk of MS (Aim 2). Finally, we will study genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a newly established cohort of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)/early MS cases and matched controls to identify immune cell specific epigenetic influences on the development of MS (Aim 3). We will utilize extraordinary MS case-control resources nested within the large, population-based membership of Northern California Kaiser Permanente, as well as DNA, genetic and clinical data assembled for this project through the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium; more than 10,000 individuals of White/European ancestry will be studied using a suite of statistical methods of analysis. Results from proposed epidemiologic studies of the most important MS genes and causal variants in the context of relevant environmental exposures will inform new functional studies, and have potential to support the development of more effective approaches for prevention, diagnosis and treatment. The complete identification of genetic and environmental influences and how they contribute independently and jointly to the development of MS and expression of particular disease characteristics would play a major role in understanding disease etiology, and would contribute greatly to disease prevention strategies and development of targeted and more effective therapies.",Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis,8829259,R01ES017080,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' California ', ' Cells ', ' Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' CNS disorder ', ' CNS Diseases ', ' Central Nervous System Diseases ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Chronology ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' MHC Class II Genes ', ' MHC Class II ', ' HLA Class II Genes ', ' Class II Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Laboratories ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complices ', ' Histocompatibility Complices ', ' Histocompatibility Complex ', ' Major Histocompatibility Complex ', ' Methods ', ' insular sclerosis ', ' MS (Multiple Sclerosis) ', ' Disseminated Sclerosis ', ' Multiple Sclerosis ', ' Myelin ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Pathology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Perinatal ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' European ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' cohort ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' genetic testing ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' neurological dysfunction ', ' Neurologic Dysfunctions ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' copy number variation ', ' Copy Number Polymorphism ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' 6p21 ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' insertion/deletion ', ' insertion-deletion mutation ', ' insertion-deletion ', ' insertion/deletion mutation ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' population based ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2015,572704,0.04840866599709247
"Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches ABSTRACT Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. Proper treatment of data types emerging from a diverse set of molecular and environmental profiling technologies cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical routines and new computational approaches are needed. In line with the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods and integrate large- scale genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect preterm birth (PTB) in diverse populations. Preterm birth, or the delivery of an infant prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is a major health concern. Infants born prematurely, comprising of about 12% of the US newborns, have elevated risks of neonatal mortality and a wide array of health problems. Preterm birth rates vary among different ethnic groups, with frequencies significantly elevated in African Americans and moderately elevated in Hispanics in comparison to Europeans. Environmental and socioeconomic factors alone may not explain these disparities and despite the evidence for a genetic basis to preterm birth, to date no causal genetic variants have been identified. In this proposal I aim to leverage the rich genetic and environmental variation data and develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of biology of preterm birth as it relates to all populations. To that extent, I propose three aims. In aim 1, I will develop computational methods to identify and validate novel genetic factors for preterm birth by genome-wide association (GWA) study in diverse ethnic populations. I obtained a comprehensive set of publicly available PTB case and control datasets consisting of ethnically diverse mothers and babies including 3,500 cases and nearly 16,000 controls from dbGAP and will carry out an ancestry-based case-control GWA study to identify genetic factors influencing PTB. In aim 2, I will develop analytical methodology to identify environmental and socioeconomic factors that impact preterm birth in diverse ethnic populations. I propose to integrate linked California State databases covering over 3 million births across diverse populations with geographical location data and pollution levels and UV exposure data from the Environmental Protection Agency in order to identify whether these exposures play a role in contributing to population-specific PTB risk. In aim 3, I will carry out integrative data analysis and build computational models in order to identify population specific interactions between the genetic and environmental factors affecting PTB risk. I hypothesize that gene-environment interactions contribute to population differences in preterm birth risk following environmental exposures. The proposed work will allow us to learn more about the etiology PTB, but could also be extended to other phenotypes of interest. This project is the logical next step for the study of the interaction of genetics and environment in the context of disease, which can be used to inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. The goal of this proposal is to develop computational approaches to integrate diverse genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect disease in diverse populations and apply them to the study of preterm birth. The methodology developed as part of this proposal can be extended and applied to other phenotypes of interest and inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic

"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health.

"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,9044557,P30ES006096,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Arteries ', ' Attention ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Equipment ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genome Project ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Neurology ', ' Ohio ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Power Plants ', ' Public Health ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Transportation ', ' Monozygotic twins ', ' Identical Twins ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' malignant endocrine gland neoplasm ', ' malignant endocrine gland tumor ', ' Malignant Endocrine Tumor ', ' Malignant Endocrine Neoplasm ', ' Endocrine Gland Cancer ', ' Endocrine Cancer ', ' lipid disorder ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' environmental agent ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Route ', ' experience ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' health science research ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' member ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Dose ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Core Facility ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Update ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Origin of Adult Disease ', ' Fetal Basis of Adult Disease ', ' FeBAD ', ' Barker Hypothesis ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' human capital ', ' endocrine disrupting ', ' Endocrine disruption ', ' integrative health ', ' integrative healing ', ' Integrative Medicine ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' Allergic Disease ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' epigenome ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2016,2371012,0.1091726280590002
"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Smoking is a major cause of health disparities, and socioeconomic status (SES) is strongly associated with lower rates of smoking cessation. Several major conceptual models have been proposed that share a key, common mechanism linking SES to health behaviors such as cessation, noting that the life circumstances associated with low SES lead to greater exposure to stress, which then influences behavior. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among low SES individuals is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of SES and social history, contextual and environmental influences, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, and acute momentary precipitants on stress, smoking lapse, and abstinence among 300 smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed using real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of Autosense, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and geographic positioning system (GPS). Autosense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or encounters a stressor. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse and stress ascertained in real time through Autosense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is the first study to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by low SES individuals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of socioeconomic status, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, context/environment, and acute precipitants on stress, smoking lapse, and abstinence among 300 smokers attempting to quit.","Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation",9110914,R01CA190329,"['Affect ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Motivation ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Poverty ', ' Real-Time Systems ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Abstinence ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' primary outcome ', ' mindfulness ', ' distress tolerance ', ' social health determinants ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' built environment ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NCI,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,720845,-0.01312639129495598
"Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology shows promise by allowing designers to specifically select unique combinations of material properties as needed increasing the effectiveness of applications in medicine, coatings, lubrication, semiconductors, composites, and many others. These materials with their unique combinations of properties on exposure to humans may result in unanticipated hazards, however, putting workers in nanotechnology-related industries at risk. Traditional animal testing is expensive and too slow to evaluate potential risks for the current pace of new nanomaterial development. Both technology developers and regulators need more rapid methods to evaluate new nanomaterial configurations for their risk potential. Much hope is placed in high-throughput in vitro screening assays, but the relevance of these results to the potential for human disease or even the observed toxic effects in animal exposures is unclear. Some research has proposed Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs) to predict in vitro nanomaterial toxicity in a few specific assays, but the applicability of these models to a wider group of materials, alternative in vitro assays, or in vivo toxicity has not been explored. If the primary exposure pathway for workers in the near term is inhalation, which in vitro assays will provide the most reliable risk information for that scenario? Two recently available data sources will permit this study to investigate this question: the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ToxCast data for nanomaterials and the Nanomaterial Pulmonary Toxicity Database (NTDB), a collection of published peer reviewed studies observing pulmonary inflammation in rodents upon exposures to nanomaterials. This study will pursue the following specific aims: (1.) identify combinations of in vitro assay results that can reliably forecast the results of pulmonary inflammation results in rodents; (2.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to a wider array of in vitro toxicity assays; and (3.) evaluate whether existing proposed QSARs for nanomaterial toxicity apply to in vivo pulmonary inflammation results. This study will employ machine learning methods to cluster similar nanomaterials between the various in vitro and in vivo results, and to identify combinations of in vitro assays that rank order the toxicity of nanomaterials most similarly to pulmonary inflammation results in rodents considering also how changes in specific chemical and physical particle properties exacerbate or mitigate observed toxicity. This study addresses documented research needs in the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) cross- sector Nanotechnology program including specific goals in the Human Health and Informatics categories. Implementation complies with the Research to Practice (r2p) Initiative in its formulation, design, and implementation plan including industry an public outreach. The insight generated by this study will improve nanomaterial risk screening capabilities and focus attention and effort on those measurements and techniques proven to be most effective and reliable enabling better management and control of the risks faced by workers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although toxicity risk information for nanoparticles is accumulating rapidly, the development of new nanomaterial configurations is proceeding too fast for our best risk assessment tools (i.e. animal testing) to keep up. The new availability of two large databases of in vitro assay results and pulmonary inflammation results in rodents will permit this study to investigate which in vitro assays provide the most predictive information about the results from in vivo exposures, and thus speed up the risk screening process for nanomaterials. The results of this study will have important implications for more quickly identifying new nanomaterial-related risks to workers.",Forecasting pulmonary inflammation from in vitro assay results for nanoparticles,9144793,R03OH010956,[''],NIOSH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2016,66564,0.016795983185799977
"Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a four-year study of cognitive markers of late-life suicide. Our overarching goal is to find factors predictive of high-lethality suicidal behavior in late life. Extending the stress-diathesis model, our research program seeks to understand how trait-like diatheses - impaired cognitive control, deficits in social processing, and impulsivity - are expressed in poor decisions, both in experimental paradigms and in the context of real-world decision making. Our current cross-sectional study focuses on cognitive correlates of late-life suicidal behavior, linking it to poor cognitive contro. Adding to a growing body of evidence, we have preliminary evidence that older suicide attempters are impaired in their decision-making. Further, we have important clues about dimensions of heterogeneity in suicidal behavior. We see that high-lethality suicide attempters struggle in complex environments and make poor social decisions. By contrast, we see a tendency toward short-sighted decisions falling under the broad category of impulsivity in people with low-lethality and unplanned suicide attempts. The proposed study examines the cognitive and neural underpinnings of disadvantageous decisions in individuals with high-lethality attempts. We propose to (i) relate cognitive control deficits to poor decision-making in complex, ambiguous environments in older suicide attempters, (ii) to describe neural system alterations that may underlie poor cognitive control and disadvantageous decisions, (iii) to extend our investigations to poor social decisions that may contribute to late-life suicidal behavior, and (iv to develop an algorithm for predicting suicide risk that incorporates these features in addition to established risk factors. These goals will be accomplished by two interlinked studies. Study I is a cross-sectional, case- control comparison of 70 high-lethality suicide attempters, 70 low-lethality suicide attempters, 70 non-suicidal depressed, and 50 non-psychiatric controls. We focus on older suicide attempters, as suicide rates are high in old age and because late-life suicide attempts, due to their serious and determined nature, offer a window into death by suicide. Study I will use a framework that combines behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience, with multilevel clinical, behavioral, cognitive, and imaging assessments. Our sampling and assessment strategy was designed with particular attention to possible confounders. Study II will follow 250 older suicide attempters (110 enrolled to date + 140 newly recruited) for up to 4 years, capturing recurrent attempts. It will serve as a prospective validatin of our predictive model. The extensive clinical and behavioral/cognitive characterization combined with a machine learning approach will allow us to develop an algorithm for suicide risk prediction which can inform clinical practice. The investigative team includes experts in reward learning and model-based imaging (Dombrovski), geriatric neuroimaging (Aizeinstein), behavioral economics (De Bruine), analysis of neural and longitudinal data (Weissfield), decision neuroscience (Clark), neuropsychology of suicide (Keilp) and of geriatric depression (Butters). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, about 6000 people aged 65 and older die by suicide in the US, with non-fatal suicide attempts numbering at least 2-4 times as many; however, clinicians lack tools for identifying those at risk and targeted treatments. Suicide follows a decision process, and recent studies have shown that suicidal individuals are often bad at making decisions in other situations; this study specifically explores patterns of decision-making seen in older people with near-lethal suicide attempts.",Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide,9115234,R01MH085651,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Butter ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' liability to disease ', ' Diathesis ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Gambling ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' Patients ', ' Punishment ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' K-18 conjugate ', ' K18 combination ', ' K18 ', ' K-18 ', ' falls ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' preference ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' social ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' comparison group ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' geriatric depression ', ' cost ', ' neglect ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Affective ', ' neuropsychological ', ' suicidal individual ', ' suicide attempter ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent response ', ' BOLD response ', ' cognitive control ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral economics ', ' biological heterogeneity ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,488490,0.123111182445826
"Genetic Susceptibility and Risk Model for Pancreatic Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic cancer (PanC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women in the U.S. Better understanding of the etiology and developing risk prediction models for early detection and prevention are urgently needed for this rapidly fatal disease. The majority of PanC are caused by the interplay of both genetic and environmental factors. Known risk factors for PanC include cigarette smoking, obesity, long-term type II diabetes, and family history. In addition, our previous case-control study has shown that excess body mass index (BMI) in young adulthood confers a higher risk of PanC than weight gain at later age. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several chromosomal regions and genes in association with risk of PanC (PanScan). Our pathway analyses of the PanScan GWAS data have uncovered several novel biological pathways associated with the risk for PanC. However, it remains unknown how environmental or host risk factors modify the association between genetic factors and the PanC risk, which knowledge is critical to better understanding of the etiology and developing a risk prediction model and early intervention strategies for PanC. The goal of this project is to identify gene-environment interactions and develop and validate a risk prediction model including both common and rare genetic variants using the PanScan GWAS data and the exposure information of over 2,200 case-control pairs and an ongoing ExomeChip-based study of PanC genotyping both common SNPs and >240,000 rare functional exonic variants in over 4,100 cases and 4,700 controls from six case-control studies in the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4) and a nested case-control study from Europe (EPIC). We will validate the absolute risk prediction model in two large prospective cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort of 15,000 individuals and the Kaiser Permanente cohort of 100,000 individuals. We will also develop novel statistical methods to identify genes modifying the association between changing BMI at different age periods and PanC risk using the unique dataset from a case-control study of PanC conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Our proposed project hinges on novel integration of GWAS, ExomeChip, exposure data of a large number of PanC cases and controls, recently developed powerful statistical methods and analysis strategies for detecting genome-wide gene/pathway-environment interactions and polygenic approaches to genetic risk prediction. The work proposed here is expected not only to advance our understanding of the etiology of PanC and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of PanC, but also to greatly facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, improved survival and prevention of PanC. The novel statistical methods developed here are also applicable to other cancers and complex disease, and we will develop user-friendly software packages for public use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 43,900 new cases of pancreatic cancer are expected to occur in the US in 2012, almost all rapidly fatal. This project will not only advance our understanding of the etiology of pancreatic cancer and delineate how genes and lifestyle or host factors modify the risk of pancreatic cancer, but also will facilitate identification of high-risk individuals, and thus, contribute to early detection, prevention, and improved survival of pancreatic cancer.

"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows Abstract: Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking. Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (PI) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals. By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 proposal builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health. In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study. Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities. Narrative: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking. Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This proposal will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",9026614,R00ES022986,"['abstracting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Body Burden ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Cities ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Italy ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mentorship ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Mexico ', ' Nails ', ' Nail plate ', ' Neurology ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' forest ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' Perinatal Exposure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' Instruction ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' lead exposure ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Metal exposure ', ' exposure to metal ', ' 4 year old ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 7 year old ', ' seven year old ', ' age 7 years ', ' 13 year old ', ' thirteen year old ', ' age 13 years ', ' analytical tool ', ' neurotoxic ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' public health priorities ', ' longitudinal design ', ' early life exposure ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R00,2016,248999,0.08855740927593386
"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is a near universal exposure that is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. The goal of this study is to identify airway gene expression changes due to chronic high endotoxin exposure in inner city schools and textile mills, and to determine whether these gene expression changes can identify important mechanisms of disease and serve as a clinically useful biomarker for important asthma and COPD subtypes.","Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease",9066670,K23ES023700,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Bronchi ', ' Burns ', ' Burn injury ', ' cotton mill fever ', ' cotton dust asthma ', ' brown lung ', ' Cotton mill asthma ', ' Byssinosis ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Closed Cohort Studies ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' cotton ', ' Cotton Plant ', ' Gossypium ', ' Critical Care ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Endotoxins ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Equipment ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Gram-Negative Bacteria ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitalization ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' COAD ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Respiratory System, Nose, Nasal Passages ', ' Nasal Passages Nose ', ' Nasal ', ' Nose ', ' Obstruction ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' emphysematous ', ' Emphysema ', ' Pulmonary Emphysema ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' respiratory symptom ', ' pulmonary symptom ', ' airway symptom ', ' Respiratory Signs and Symptoms ', ' Smoking ', ' sound ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' fabric ', ' Textiles ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Silk ', ' Measures ', ' Indoor Air Pollution ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Exposure to ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Tobacco smoke ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Occupational ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' American ', ' grade school ', ' elementary school ', ' experience ', ' Nasal Epithelium ', ' bronchial epithelium ', ' cohort ', ' attenuation ', ' respiratory airway obstruction ', ' obstructive airway disease ', ' Obstructive Lung Diseases ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Thorax ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorace ', ' Chest ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' disease subtype ', ' disorder subtype ', ' Genomics ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Institution ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' microarray technology ', ' microarray analyses ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' Symptoms ', ' Consent ', ' M.P.H.

"(PQA4) GPS exposure to environments & relations with biomarkers of cancer risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet, and obesity are related to breast and colon cancer directly and through insulin and inflammation pathways. Greater access to healthy environments in residential neighborhoods is associated with higher physical activity (PA), a healthier diet, lower BMI, and in one study lower insulin resistance. Despite some significant findings, the effect sizes in built environment research have been small likely because of a mismatch between the environment assessed (home neighborhoods only) and location where the behaviors occur. Temporal variation in behaviors and locations within and across days has also been ignored. We propose to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static addressed based GIS measures of access. We will study a large sample of adults (N=700), 40-75 years old, who have lived at their residence at least one year. We will recruit participants from census blocks specially selected to vary by income, walkability, and food environments to ensure environmental variability not achieved in a random sample. We will ensure balanced recruitment by census block type (walkability & food environments) across ethnicity, gender, age, and season. Half the sample will be Hispanic to explore potential interaction effects by ethnicity. Participants will complete surveys about their PA, sedentary behavior, environmental perceptions, self-selection, cancer risk, and demographics. PA and sedentary behavior will also be assessed by accelerometry and Machine Learning techniques will be employed to objectively identify specific behaviors likely related to the built environment e.g. walking, biking, riding in a car, screen time etc. Participants will complete the ASA 24 to assess diet, total calories and fat calories. A subsample (N=50) will wear a SenseCam to assess social context, validate GIS built environment measures, and validate the Machine Learned categories. Dynamic GIS measures of exposure will be created from 7 day person worn GPS data matched to GIS indicators of supportive PA and food environments (e.g. parks, walkable streets, fresh produce markets etc.) weighted by time, speed, transportation mode and features of the environment e.g. parcel size. Static residential GIS buffers of access to neighborhood resources will be created within a 1km street network buffer around a participant's home. Using multilevel statistical models adjusting for clustering, we will investigate whether GPS based Dynamic GIS measures of exposure to healthy food and PA supportive environments are more strongly associated with breast and colon cancer risk factors - including behaviors (PA, sedentary behavior, & diet), BMI, and biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation (e.g. CRP, IL-6, HOMA-IR) than Static GIS measures of access to neighborhood resources.

"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9197901,R01HD089714,"['Placentome ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Placenta ', ' Placental Diseases ', ' Placenta Disorders ', ' Placenta Diseases ', ' Placental Insufficiency ', ' Placental Development ', ' Placentation ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' First Trimester ', ' Early Placental Phase ', ' First Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Third Trimester ', ' Last Trimester ', ' Third Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' Toxin ', ' Measures ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Premature Birth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Pre-term birth ', ' Motor Vehicles ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Exposure to ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Pollution ', ' Investigation ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' trafficking ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' infant morbidity ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Normalities ', ' Normalcy ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Data ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' transcriptomics ', ' implantation ', ' primary outcome ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' bisulfite sequencing ', ' bisulfite-seq ', ' BS-seq ', ' epigenome-wide association studies ', ' epigenome wide association analysis ', ' EWAS ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' exosome ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' IUGR ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetus ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Histology ', ' Industry ', ' Maps ', ' Methylation ', ' Mothers ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Pathology ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2016,649585,0.16402178181707847
"Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide prevention is a significant public health priority. We have made great strides in understanding risk factors for suicidal behavior using conventional statistical methods; however prediction of suicidal behavior in practice remains poor. In 2014, NIMH and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Research Prioritization Task Force published A Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention: An Action Plan to Save Lives, which identified six key unanswered questions about suicide. The proposed project addresses the key unanswered question of ""how can we better or more optimally detect/predict risk?"" from the report. Specifically, the project addresses the following short and long term objectives associated with this unanswered question: (1) developing risk algorithms from health care data that can be used for suicide risk detection and (2) overcoming base rate challenges and response bias by identifying innovative biostatistical and other research methods. Recent advances in statistical methodology, including the application of machine learning methods in psychiatry, will allow us to capitalize on what has been learned from previous studies to propel forward our ability to predict suicidal behavior. The aims of this study are to examine immediate and long-term risk factors of three separate suicidal behavior outcomes including (a) suicidal ideation, (b) suicide attempt and (c) death from suicide to develop general population risk algorithms and elucidate novel interactions, both overall and among high risk subgroups. Further, we will use regression-based analyses to quantify the main effects of predictor variables and novel interactions. Study Design: This series of case-control studies will use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for suicidal behavior in the population of Denmark from 1994-2015. Extensive data on psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, prescriptions, social variables, and mortality have been routinely and rapidly recorded in national registries in Denmark for decades, allowing for the thorough examination of longitudinal predictors and the efficient examination of low base rate outcomes. Gender differences will be explored, as well as algorithms among high risk subgroups of the population (e.g., groups with psychiatric diagnoses). Implications: The current study addresses NIMH's research priorities of 1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and 2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH- supported research. This work will inform clinicians and policymakers regarding the patient groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts. In future work, risk algorithms developed as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools that can identify patients at risk for suicidal behavior.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This expansive general population study will inform policymakers and public health practitioners about the groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts (i.e., what characteristic combinations confer the greatest risk for suicidal behavior among general population and high risk subgroups). In future work, risk algorithms discovered as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools.        ",Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population,9080772,R01MH109507,"['Algorithms ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Denmark ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Future ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Patients ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Substance Dependence ', ' Substance Addiction ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' interest ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' novel ', ' Prevention Research ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' public health priorities ', ' screening ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2016,321827,0.1175341016732534
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9384304,R01DA042988,"['Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cognition ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Maternal Behavior ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mothers ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Glean ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' intraparietal sulcus ', ' disability ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Exposure to ', ' Opiates ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Parietal ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' Fetal Cocaine Exposure ', ' prenatally cocaine exposed ', ' prenatal cocaine exposure ', ' gestational cocaine exposure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' response ', ' neurobehavior ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Future Generations ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' neonate ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' drug of abuse ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' drugs abused ', ' abused drugs ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' effective intervention ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' cocaine exposure ', ' exposure to cocaine ', ' exposed to cocaine ', ' cocaine-exposed ', ' learning ability ', ' learning competence ', ' learning achievement ', ' cognitive development ', ' cognitive ability ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' maternal caregiving ', ' maternal care giving ', ' neonatal brain ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,704051,0.03289520685834932
"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist.

"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment.

"Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity Project Summary/Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a known neurotoxin that tens of thousands of workers are exposed to daily, but it is unknown if the current safety guidelines are appropriately strong or too weak to protect them. In an ideal world knowledge of the exposure history of an individual should allow to predict specific risks for health effects. To monitor the effect of Mn welding fumes on workers, the medical imaging techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) are used to non-invasively image the structure, function, and neurochemistry in the human brain. However, currently studies are not making adequate strides in connecting Mn exposure to changes in MRI or MRS. Studies are only correlating Mn exposure to imaging parameters without taking into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the metal or the individual exposure history, thus lacking the ability to interpret individual data. The broad objective of this project is to fill this crucial gap by creating and validating mathematical models that take into account imaging data, pharmacokinetic properties of Mn and the individual exposure to Mn to predict individual effects of toxicity. Our group runs an ongoing, longitudinal neuroimaging study on local welders and matched controls. Thus we will have abundant and longitudinal data on brain MRI (e.g. T1 maps to assess the brain Mn burden), MRS data on several neurochemicals including GABA, data from personal air sampling and work history questionnaires, neurological and neuropsychological test results, and other biomarkers (toe nails, blood) at our disposal for modeling. The purpose of the current project is to assess and describe how knowledge on exposure and pharmacokinetic properties of Mn enables the interpretation of imaging data as quantitative brain Mn deposition, and how brain-region specific Mn deposition affects neurochemistry in other regions of the brain from where it is deposited. Aim 1 seeks to use MRI structural imaging and known pharmacokinetic properties of Mn to create a mathematical model that can determine the amount of Mn deposition in specific regions of the brain. Aim 2 investigates how the amount, the duration, and the location of Mn deposition in the brain affects neurochemistry. The results of this study will be a first step towards monitoring of individual risks from Mn toxicity by providing the necessary tools to translate exposure information to changes in the brain and consequent health symptoms. Importantly, a better interpretation of individual imaging data will also inform safety guidelines for the individual worker. Project Narrative Manganese (Mn) toxicity leads to disruptive symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease but has no known treatment or cure. Therefore, the prevention, rather than the treatment, of these toxic effects is the first priority for welders, smelters, and other workers exposed to Mn. The goal of this research is to create mathematical models that can predict measureable health consequences from manganese exposure using medical imaging and individual exposure data.",Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity,9328902,F31ES028081,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' GABA ', ' Aminalone ', ' Aminalon ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Maps ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neurochemical ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Poisons ', ' toxic compound ', ' poison ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Probability ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Safety ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Welding ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Measures ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Workplace ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' Test Result ', ' Occupational ', ' cohort ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Prevention ', ' Intoxication ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' air sampling ', ' Normalcy ', ' Normalities ', ' Brain region ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pharmacokinetic model ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' imaging spectroscopy ', ' spectroscopic imaging ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' motor impairment ', ' movement limitation ', ' movement impairment ', ' multimodality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' screening ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' translational impact ', ' ']",NIEHS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,44044,0.08384191880139723

"Machine Learning for Health Outcomes and Quality of Care in Low-Income  Populations PROJECT SUMMARY: Life expectancy and other health outcomes in the United States are associated with income and socioeconomic status. Low-income populations have poorer health outcomes and, unlike high-income populations, outcomes also vary by geography. While these relationships have been described for decades in prior literature, the underlying mechanisms of these connections have not been identified. Understanding the determinants of such health disparities is critical to improving health outcomes and preventing disease. The impact of health insurance on health outcomes in low-income populations is unknown, as it has not been studied empirically on a national scale. The proposed research will be the first ever study to employ randomization of health plans in Medicaid, the government insurance program for individuals who lack resources to pay for health care. We will establish the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes in low-income populations. This will involve a novel data source containing enrollment and health care utilization information for the universe of low-income households in Massachusetts from 2006 to 2015. We are uniquely positioned to study the effect of Medicaid and type of Medicaid coverage as our data contains enrollees who were randomly assigned to plans and those who were not. These data are linked to important health outcomes, including cause of death, birth weight, and APGAR scores. We will additionally exploit our partial random assignment to examine effect modification by quality of care. Disparities exist in quality of care along income lines, and low-income populations tend to have lower quality scores. To accomplish these goals, we propose the creation of a nonparametric machine learning framework for generalizing results from experimental and quasi-experimental studies. This flexible robust methodology will be developed and tailored for our study of health disparities in order to generalize results from within-state studies to i) the full population of low-income individuals within a state and ii) populations of low-income individuals in other states. With average monthly Medicaid enrollment of over 55 million individuals across the country, this project will have significant broad impacts on low-income populations. Our findings and new analytic tools will provide foundational understanding of the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes among low-income populations, including any effect modification by quality of care. Unraveling the complicated relationships between insurance and health outcomes in low-income populations is an essential component toward improving these outcomes. The lack of randomization in most public health studies on disparities has contributed to diverging results and confusion around interpretation for health policy. The development of our machine learning framework for the generalizability of population health studies is innovative as it will revolutionize the ability of researchers to assess the effects of health exposures and interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Health outcomes and quality of care in low-income populations lag behind other groups, and the impact of health insurance on these disparities among low-income individuals is currently unknown. The goal of this proposal is to examine the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes in low-income populations with rigorous new tools in partially randomized data. This will be achieved by developing a novel machine learning framework for the generalizability of experimental and quasiexperimental studies, providing population health scientists with robust methodology to assess the effects of health interventions and exposures.",Machine Learning for Health Outcomes and Quality of Care in Low-Income  Populations,10240136,DP2MD012722,[''],NIMHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP2,2017,1164023,0.05048829844705742
"Functional Dissection of Prenatal Drug Effects on the Developing Brain and Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY Despite efforts of prevention and education programs, licit and illicit drug use among pregnant women remains prevalent1. Most drugs of abuse easily cross the placenta and can alter the intricate balance among fetal neurotransmitters and receptors, which critically dictate in utero development of the brain's functional wiring system2-5. Therefore prenatal drug exposures (PDE) have long-lasting implications for brain and behavioral development since a small perturbation to the immature brain circuits may cascade into substantial deviations during long-term growth6. Existing behavioral studies provide converging evidence on the detrimental effects of PDE throughout development 1,6,7 but mechanistic studies of the brain basis of PDE remains scarce, especially during the infancy period. Nevertheless, studying the brain mechanisms of PDE during infancy is critical and urgently needed given that: 1) the infancy period immediately follows PDE insults and features the most dynamic postnatal brain development; 2) the infancy period is least confounded by postnatal environmental adversities that frequently accompany PDE; 3) identification of brain alterations associated with PDE during this stage has the best potential to guide early preventive intervention before behavioral problems onset. Our previous results8,9 demonstrated significant and widespread functional connectivity alterations in neonates prenatally exposed to cocaine and marijuana, respectively. However, three major areas need to be better delineated: 1) an overall picture of PDE effects on whole brain functional organization is lacking; 2) a more systematic delineation of the potential differential drug effects and their interactions is needed given the multi- drug exposure for most of the drug-abusing mothers; 3) the prediction power of detected neonatal functional alterations for later behavioral outcomes remains to be determined. Our long-term goal is to derive early functional-connectivity-based brain biomarkers for different PDEs that will reliably predict long-term behavioral outcomes. Our goal in this project is to derive neonate-based functional connectivity signatures for different PDEs and test their prediction power for 3-month behavioral outcomes. This project is significant because it is expected to be the first to identify drug-specific neurophenotypes for different PDEs on early brain functional and behavioral development, prior to the damaging postnatal influences that may accompany parental drug abuse. It is innovative because: 1) It will integrate resting-state brain functional connectivity and cognitive and behavioral function to quantify the potential drug-specific and drug-common effects on brain and behavior development in neonates; 2) It will apply detailed multi-level whole brain survey to discern differential drug-effect profiles and leverage advanced machine learning algorithms to better characterize their link with later behavioral outcomes.

"Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures Project Summary/Abstract  The placenta is an essential organ in human development, and disruption of its function can result in problems in pregnancy including miscarriage, preterm labor, preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Additionally, disrupted placenta function during pregnancy has been associated with a great number of disorders and diseases that do not present until much later in the offspring's life such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, developmental delay and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. How the exposures encountered in the environment drive alterations in placenta structure and function is poorly understood, and placenta function is difficult to assess in vivo using noninvasive methods. We propose to understand how gene expression is altered in the placenta during gestation by noninvasively characterizing the placenta transcriptome in association with exposure to chemicals known to alter endocrine signaling. These chemicals, called phthalates, are commonly found in a variety of commercial products such as plastics and personal care products, and phthalate exposure has also been shown to effect neurodevelopment. The link between phthalate exposure and placenta gene expression in vivo is not yet clear; therefore we have assembled a team comprised of neuroscientists, placenta biologists, environmental epidemiologists, and genomics experts do address how phthalate exposure and gestational age effects gene that are expressed in the placenta but not in other tissues. One of the advantages of the proposed research is that we will assess placenta gene expression noninvasively through RNA molecules contained in extracellular vesicles that are secreted into the urine of pregnant women. Collecting gene expression data and chemical exposure data from urine is highly clinically relevant, and we expect our approach will have clear translational applications just as home pregnancy tests that rely on the detection of placenta produced hormones in urine have become common. Our proposed study will provide the basic science background for the development of rapid, noninvasive tests for assessing placenta function, chemical exposures, and ultimately problems in neurodevelopment and other danger signals during pregnancy. Project Narrative  The proposed research will collect genome wide placenta gene expression data from 50 pregnant women at three time points during gestation. In addition to assessing gene expression differences the proposed research will develop methods to noninvasively determine placenta-originating transcripts among all transcripts existing in the urine of pregnant women. The proposed research will also compare gene expression to endocrine disrupting chemicals known to cause health problems.",Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures,9341310,R21ES027878,"['Miscarriage ', ' Spontaneous abortion ', ' Archives ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' corticotropin releasing hormone ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticoliberin ', ' CRF-41 ', ' ACTH-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone ', ' diethylhexylphthalate ', ' Dioctyl Phthalate ', ' Di-2-Ethylhexylphthalate ', ' DEHP ', ' Diethylhexyl Phthalate ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' IUGR ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Goals ', ' Choriogonadotropin ', ' Chorionic Gonadotropin ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Development ', ' Illinois ', ' Premature Labor ', ' Preterm Labor ', ' Premature Obstetric Labor ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is a near universal exposure that is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. The goal of this study is to identify airway gene expression changes due to chronic high endotoxin exposure in inner city schools and textile mills, and to determine whether these gene expression changes can identify important mechanisms of disease and serve as a clinically useful biomarker for important asthma and COPD subtypes.","Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease",9284482,K23ES023700,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Bronchi ', ' cotton mill fever ', ' cotton dust asthma ', ' brown lung ', ' Cotton mill asthma ', ' Byssinosis ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Closed Cohort Studies ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' cotton ', ' Cotton Plant ', ' Gossypium ', ' Critical Care ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Endotoxins ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Equipment ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Gram-Negative Bacteria ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' COAD ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nose ', ' Respiratory System, Nose, Nasal Passages ', ' Nasal Passages Nose ', ' Nasal ', ' Obstruction ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Pulmonary Emphysema ', ' emphysematous ', ' Emphysema ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Respiratory Signs and Symptoms ', ' respiratory symptom ', ' pulmonary symptom ', ' airway symptom ', ' Smoking ', ' sound ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Textiles ', ' fabric ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Silk ', ' Measures ', ' Indoor Air Pollution ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Pediatric asthma ', ' Asthma in Children ', ' Childhood Asthma ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Tobacco smoke ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Occupational ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' American ', ' elementary school ', ' grade school ', ' experience ', ' Nasal Epithelium ', ' bronchial epithelium ', ' cohort ', ' attenuation ', ' Obstructive Lung Diseases ', ' respiratory airway obstruction ', ' obstructive airway disease ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' disorder subtype ', ' disease subtype ', ' Genomics ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' Institution ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Address ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' microarray technology ', ' microarray analyses ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' Symptoms ', ' Consent ', ' International ', ' Master of Public Health ', ' M.P.H.

"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",9212418,R01ES027747,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Animals ', ' Arsenic ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Cd element ', ' Cadmium ', ' Carbon ', ' Carbon Black ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognition ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Metals ', ' Nitrates ', ' NO3- ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Suggestion ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Trace Mineral ', ' Biometals ', ' Trace Elements ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Vesicle ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pollution ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Particulate ', ' Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates ', ' sulfate ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Visit ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' cohort ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' RNA marker ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Public Health Applications Research ', ' Public Health Applications ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' toxic metal ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' extracellular vesicles ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' ']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2017,792334,0.0384963578669223
"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows Abstract: Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking. Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (PI) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals. By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 proposal builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health. In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study. Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities. Narrative: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking. Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This proposal will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",9189610,R00ES022986,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Body Burden ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Cities ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Italy ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mentorship ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Mexico ', ' Nail plate ', ' Nails ', ' Neurology ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Measures ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' forest ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Perinatal Exposure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' Instruction ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' lead exposure ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Metal exposure ', ' exposure to metal ', ' 4 year old ', ' four years of age ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 4 years of age ', ' 7 year old ', ' seven years of age ', ' seven year old ', ' age 7 years ', ' 7 years of age ', ' 13 year old ', ' thirteen years of age ', ' thirteen year old ', ' age 13 years ', ' 13 years of age ', ' analytical tool ', ' neurotoxic ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' public health priorities ', ' longitudinal design ', ' early life exposure ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R00,2017,248999,0.08855740927593386
"Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide prevention is a significant public health priority. We have made great strides in understanding risk factors for suicidal behavior using conventional statistical methods; however prediction of suicidal behavior in practice remains poor. In 2014, NIMH and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Research Prioritization Task Force published A Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention: An Action Plan to Save Lives, which identified six key unanswered questions about suicide. The proposed project addresses the key unanswered question of ""how can we better or more optimally detect/predict risk?"" from the report. Specifically, the project addresses the following short and long term objectives associated with this unanswered question: (1) developing risk algorithms from health care data that can be used for suicide risk detection and (2) overcoming base rate challenges and response bias by identifying innovative biostatistical and other research methods. Recent advances in statistical methodology, including the application of machine learning methods in psychiatry, will allow us to capitalize on what has been learned from previous studies to propel forward our ability to predict suicidal behavior. The aims of this study are to examine immediate and long-term risk factors of three separate suicidal behavior outcomes including (a) suicidal ideation, (b) suicide attempt and (c) death from suicide to develop general population risk algorithms and elucidate novel interactions, both overall and among high risk subgroups. Further, we will use regression-based analyses to quantify the main effects of predictor variables and novel interactions. Study Design: This series of case-control studies will use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for suicidal behavior in the population of Denmark from 1994-2015. Extensive data on psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, prescriptions, social variables, and mortality have been routinely and rapidly recorded in national registries in Denmark for decades, allowing for the thorough examination of longitudinal predictors and the efficient examination of low base rate outcomes. Gender differences will be explored, as well as algorithms among high risk subgroups of the population (e.g., groups with psychiatric diagnoses). Implications: The current study addresses NIMH's research priorities of 1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and 2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH- supported research. This work will inform clinicians and policymakers regarding the patient groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts. In future work, risk algorithms developed as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools that can identify patients at risk for suicidal behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This expansive general population study will inform policymakers and public health practitioners about the groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts (i.e., what characteristic combinations confer the greatest risk for suicidal behavior among general population and high risk subgroups). In future work, risk algorithms discovered as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools.",Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population,9315225,R01MH109507,"['Algorithms ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Denmark ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Future ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Patients ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Substance Addiction ', ' Substance Dependence ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Case Series ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' interest ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' novel ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' public health priorities ', ' screening ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2017,296515,0.1175341016732534
"Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a four-year study of cognitive markers of late-life suicide. Our overarching goal is to find factors predictive of high-lethality suicidal behavior in late life. Extending the stress-diathesis model, our research program seeks to understand how trait-like diatheses - impaired cognitive control, deficits in social processing, and impulsivity - are expressed in poor decisions, both in experimental paradigms and in the context of real-world decision making. Our current cross-sectional study focuses on cognitive correlates of late-life suicidal behavior, linking it to poor cognitive contro. Adding to a growing body of evidence, we have preliminary evidence that older suicide attempters are impaired in their decision-making. Further, we have important clues about dimensions of heterogeneity in suicidal behavior. We see that high-lethality suicide attempters struggle in complex environments and make poor social decisions. By contrast, we see a tendency toward short-sighted decisions falling under the broad category of impulsivity in people with low-lethality and unplanned suicide attempts. The proposed study examines the cognitive and neural underpinnings of disadvantageous decisions in individuals with high-lethality attempts. We propose to (i) relate cognitive control deficits to poor decision-making in complex, ambiguous environments in older suicide attempters, (ii) to describe neural system alterations that may underlie poor cognitive control and disadvantageous decisions, (iii) to extend our investigations to poor social decisions that may contribute to late-life suicidal behavior, and (iv to develop an algorithm for predicting suicide risk that incorporates these features in addition to established risk factors. These goals will be accomplished by two interlinked studies. Study I is a cross-sectional, case- control comparison of 70 high-lethality suicide attempters, 70 low-lethality suicide attempters, 70 non-suicidal depressed, and 50 non-psychiatric controls. We focus on older suicide attempters, as suicide rates are high in old age and because late-life suicide attempts, due to their serious and determined nature, offer a window into death by suicide. Study I will use a framework that combines behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience, with multilevel clinical, behavioral, cognitive, and imaging assessments. Our sampling and assessment strategy was designed with particular attention to possible confounders. Study II will follow 250 older suicide attempters (110 enrolled to date + 140 newly recruited) for up to 4 years, capturing recurrent attempts. It will serve as a prospective validatin of our predictive model. The extensive clinical and behavioral/cognitive characterization combined with a machine learning approach will allow us to develop an algorithm for suicide risk prediction which can inform clinical practice. The investigative team includes experts in reward learning and model-based imaging (Dombrovski), geriatric neuroimaging (Aizeinstein), behavioral economics (De Bruine), analysis of neural and longitudinal data (Weissfield), decision neuroscience (Clark), neuropsychology of suicide (Keilp) and of geriatric depression (Butters). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, about 6000 people aged 65 and older die by suicide in the US, with non-fatal suicide attempts numbering at least 2-4 times as many; however, clinicians lack tools for identifying those at risk and targeted treatments. Suicide follows a decision process, and recent studies have shown that suicidal individuals are often bad at making decisions in other situations; this study specifically explores patterns of decision-making seen in older people with near-lethal suicide attempts.",Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide,9277260,R01MH085651,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Butter ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' liability to disease ', ' Diathesis ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Gambling ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Punishment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' K18 combination ', ' K18 ', ' K-18 ', ' K-18 conjugate ', ' falls ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' preference ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' comparison group ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' geriatric depression ', ' cost ', ' neglect ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' suicidal individual ', ' suicide attempter ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent response ', ' BOLD response ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral economics ', ' biological heterogeneity ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,489370,0.123111182445826
"A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health,9313526,K99ES027022,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Algorithms ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Cognition ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' environmental testing ', ' Ecological Monitoring ', ' Ecologic Monitoring ', ' Environmental Monitoring ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' New York City ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rotation ', ' Schools ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Urban Population ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' technical skills ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' forest ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Distal ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Development Plans ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' experience ', ' pollutant ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' third grade ', ' 3rd grade ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ontology ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epidemiological model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' early life exposure ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' health data ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Scientist ', ' urban children ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K99,2017,96716,0.13313316656714494
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches ABSTRACT Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. Proper treatment of data types emerging from a diverse set of molecular and environmental profiling technologies cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical routines and new computational approaches are needed. In line with the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods and integrate large- scale genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect preterm birth (PTB) in diverse populations. Preterm birth, or the delivery of an infant prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is a major health concern. Infants born prematurely, comprising of about 12% of the US newborns, have elevated risks of neonatal mortality and a wide array of health problems. Preterm birth rates vary among different ethnic groups, with frequencies significantly elevated in African Americans and moderately elevated in Hispanics in comparison to Europeans. Environmental and socioeconomic factors alone may not explain these disparities and despite the evidence for a genetic basis to preterm birth, to date no causal genetic variants have been identified. In this proposal I aim to leverage the rich genetic and environmental variation data and develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of biology of preterm birth as it relates to all populations. To that extent, I propose three aims. In aim 1, I will develop computational methods to identify and validate novel genetic factors for preterm birth by genome-wide association (GWA) study in diverse ethnic populations. I obtained a comprehensive set of publicly available PTB case and control datasets consisting of ethnically diverse mothers and babies including 3,500 cases and nearly 16,000 controls from dbGAP and will carry out an ancestry-based case-control GWA study to identify genetic factors influencing PTB. In aim 2, I will develop analytical methodology to identify environmental and socioeconomic factors that impact preterm birth in diverse ethnic populations. I propose to integrate linked California State databases covering over 3 million births across diverse populations with geographical location data and pollution levels and UV exposure data from the Environmental Protection Agency in order to identify whether these exposures play a role in contributing to population-specific PTB risk. In aim 3, I will carry out integrative data analysis and build computational models in order to identify population specific interactions between the genetic and environmental factors affecting PTB risk. I hypothesize that gene-environment interactions contribute to population differences in preterm birth risk following environmental exposures. The proposed work will allow us to learn more about the etiology PTB, but could also be extended to other phenotypes of interest. This project is the logical next step for the study of the interaction of genetics and environment in the context of disease, which can be used to inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. The goal of this proposal is to develop computational approaches to integrate diverse genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect disease in diverse populations and apply them to the study of preterm birth. The methodology developed as part of this proposal can be extended and applied to other phenotypes of interest and inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches,9324358,K01LM012381,"['Affect ', ' Air Pollution ', '

"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9354508,R01HD089714,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' environmental contamination ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' IUGR ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetus ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Histology ', ' Industry ', ' Maps ', ' Methylation ', ' Mothers ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Pathology ', ' Placenta ', ' Placentome ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Placenta Diseases ', ' Placental Diseases ', ' Placenta Disorders ', ' Placental Insufficiency ', ' Placentation ', ' Placental Development ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' First Pregnancy Trimester ', ' First Trimester ', ' Early Placental Phase ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' Third Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Third Trimester ', ' Last Trimester ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' Toxin ', ' Measures ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Pre-term birth ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Motor Vehicles ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Pollution ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' cohort ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' infant morbidity ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Normalcy ', ' Normalities ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' transcriptomics ', ' implantation ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' primary outcome ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' bisulfite sequencing ', ' bisulfite-seq ', ' BS-seq ', ' epigenome-wide association studies ', ' epigenome wide association analysis ', ' EWAS ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' exosome ', ' predictive signature ', ' imaging study ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,651353,0.16402178181707847
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"Machine Learning for Health Outcomes and Quality of Care in Low-Income Populations PROJECT SUMMARY: Life expectancy and other health outcomes in the United States are associated with income and socioeconomic status. Low-income populations have poorer health outcomes and, unlike high-income populations, outcomes also vary by geography. While these relationships have been described for decades in prior literature, the underlying mechanisms of these connections have not been identified. Understanding the determinants of such health disparities is critical to improving health outcomes and preventing disease. The impact of health insurance on health outcomes in low-income populations is unknown, as it has not been studied empirically on a national scale. The proposed research will be the first ever study to employ randomization of health plans in Medicaid, the government insurance program for individuals who lack resources to pay for health care. We will establish the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes in low-income populations. This will involve a novel data source containing enrollment and health care utilization information for the universe of low-income households in Massachusetts from 2006 to 2015. We are uniquely positioned to study the effect of Medicaid and type of Medicaid coverage as our data contains enrollees who were randomly assigned to plans and those who were not. These data are linked to important health outcomes, including cause of death, birth weight, and APGAR scores. We will additionally exploit our partial random assignment to examine effect modification by quality of care. Disparities exist in quality of care along income lines, and low-income populations tend to have lower quality scores. To accomplish these goals, we propose the creation of a nonparametric machine learning framework for generalizing results from experimental and quasi-experimental studies. This flexible robust methodology will be developed and tailored for our study of health disparities in order to generalize results from within-state studies to i) the full population of low-income individuals within a state and ii) populations of low-income individuals in other states. With average monthly Medicaid enrollment of over 55 million individuals across the country, this project will have significant broad impacts on low-income populations. Our findings and new analytic tools will provide foundational understanding of the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes among low-income populations, including any effect modification by quality of care. Unraveling the complicated relationships between insurance and health outcomes in low-income populations is an essential component toward improving these outcomes. The lack of randomization in most public health studies on disparities has contributed to diverging results and confusion around interpretation for health policy. The development of our machine learning framework for the generalizability of population health studies is innovative as it will revolutionize the ability of researchers to assess the effects of health exposures and interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Health outcomes and quality of care in low-income populations lag behind other groups, and the impact of health insurance on these disparities among low-income individuals is currently unknown. The goal of this proposal is to examine the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes in low-income populations with rigorous new tools in partially randomized data. This will be achieved by developing a novel machine learning framework for the generalizability of experimental and quasi- experimental studies, providing population health scientists with robust methodology to assess the effects of health interventions and exposures.",Machine Learning for Health Outcomes and Quality of Care in Low-Income Populations,9346982,DP2MD012722,"['Apgar Score ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Confusion ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Foundations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Health Planning ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' High-Income Populations ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Literature ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methodology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' United States ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Country ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' analytical tool ', ' population health ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' improved outcome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIMHD,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP2,2017,1378477,0.05048829844705742
"Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a four-year study of cognitive markers of late-life suicide. Our overarching goal is to find factors predictive of high-lethality suicidal behavior in late life. Extending the stress-diathesis model, our research program seeks to understand how trait-like diatheses - impaired cognitive control, deficits in social processing, and impulsivity - are expressed in poor decisions, both in experimental paradigms and in the context of real-world decision making. Our current cross-sectional study focuses on cognitive correlates of late-life suicidal behavior, linking it to poor cognitive contro. Adding to a growing body of evidence, we have preliminary evidence that older suicide attempters are impaired in their decision-making. Further, we have important clues about dimensions of heterogeneity in suicidal behavior. We see that high-lethality suicide attempters struggle in complex environments and make poor social decisions. By contrast, we see a tendency toward short-sighted decisions falling under the broad category of impulsivity in people with low-lethality and unplanned suicide attempts. The proposed study examines the cognitive and neural underpinnings of disadvantageous decisions in individuals with high-lethality attempts. We propose to (i) relate cognitive control deficits to poor decision-making in complex, ambiguous environments in older suicide attempters, (ii) to describe neural system alterations that may underlie poor cognitive control and disadvantageous decisions, (iii) to extend our investigations to poor social decisions that may contribute to late-life suicidal behavior, and (iv to develop an algorithm for predicting suicide risk that incorporates these features in addition to established risk factors. These goals will be accomplished by two interlinked studies. Study I is a cross-sectional, case- control comparison of 70 high-lethality suicide attempters, 70 low-lethality suicide attempters, 70 non-suicidal depressed, and 50 non-psychiatric controls. We focus on older suicide attempters, as suicide rates are high in old age and because late-life suicide attempts, due to their serious and determined nature, offer a window into death by suicide. Study I will use a framework that combines behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience, with multilevel clinical, behavioral, cognitive, and imaging assessments. Our sampling and assessment strategy was designed with particular attention to possible confounders. Study II will follow 250 older suicide attempters (110 enrolled to date + 140 newly recruited) for up to 4 years, capturing recurrent attempts. It will serve as a prospective validatin of our predictive model. The extensive clinical and behavioral/cognitive characterization combined with a machine learning approach will allow us to develop an algorithm for suicide risk prediction which can inform clinical practice. The investigative team includes experts in reward learning and model-based imaging (Dombrovski), geriatric neuroimaging (Aizeinstein), behavioral economics (De Bruine), analysis of neural and longitudinal data (Weissfield), decision neuroscience (Clark), neuropsychology of suicide (Keilp) and of geriatric depression (Butters). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, about 6000 people aged 65 and older die by suicide in the US, with non-fatal suicide attempts numbering at least 2-4 times as many; however, clinicians lack tools for identifying those at risk and targeted treatments. Suicide follows a decision process, and recent studies have shown that suicidal individuals are often bad at making decisions in other situations; this study specifically explores patterns of decision-making seen in older people with near-lethal suicide attempts.",Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide,9445765,R01MH085651,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Butter ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' liability to disease ', ' Diathesis ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Gambling ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Punishment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' K18 combination ', ' K18 ', ' K-18 ', ' K-18 conjugate ', ' falls ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' preference ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' comparison group ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' geriatric depression ', ' cost ', ' neglect ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' suicidal individual ', ' suicide attempter ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent response ', ' BOLD response ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral economics ', ' biological heterogeneity ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,121796,0.123111182445826
"Center for Environmental Genetics This application requests a 5-year renewal of the Center for Environmental Genetics. The unified theme of  the proposal is to elucidate how gene and environment interaction through epigenetics influences disease  risks and health outcome. Ohioans are exposed to exceptionally bad air quality due to dated power plants  and the fact that it is situated in the nation's main artery of the north-south transportation route. These unique  geographical/economic features put the residents in the state at high risk of the following diseases: (a)  endocrine disruption and cancer; (b) immune and allergic diseases; (c) cardiovascular and lipid disorders;  and (d) neurology and behavior disorders. The CEG has 20-years' of accumulative success in environmental  health sciences (EHS) research, our aspiration is to help mitigate these environmental diseases, first in Ohio,  then extend our success to similar populations in the nation and around the globe. Here we propose to attain  our goal by (1) expanding EHS research human capital through the continued recruitment and support of  investigators of all levels to EHS research, (2) innovative ideas and collaborative work from new and  established investigators will be supported by the Pilot Project Program and Director's Fund, (3) junior  investigators will be mentored by a Career Development Program and strong mentor-mentee relationships;  (4) an Integrative Technology Support Core combined with a Bioinformatics Core will provide investigators  with leading-edge technologies and data analysis to attain a new level of system-biology approach to EHS;  (5) enhancement activities such as workshops, symposia and seminar series will be used to stimulate  collaboration and innovation; (6) an Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core will provide the toolbox for  translation of EHS to the clinical and human studies; and (7) a Community Outreach and Engagement Core  will serve to translate EHS to public health and health education for healthier living and disease prevention.

"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and

"Addressing Suicide Research Gaps: Understanding Mortality Outcomes in the Mid-Atlantic Region  PROJECTSUMMARY Data linkage offers the potential to improve suicide risk surveillance as well as evaluate and enhance suicide prevention approaches. Data linkage could also allow for the identification of novel predictors or combinations of predictors to improve precision medicine efforts. The ability to access and analyze health care data has expanded dramatically in the past decade. The goal of this application is to leverage data from multiple sources including hospital discharges, insurance claims, death investigations, health information exchanges, and administrative data (e.g., civil status, employment status, legal system involvement, neighborhood characteristics, unemployment, gun ownership, arrests and incarceration). Aggregating these data systems will allow for novel secondary data analyses, which will enhance our understanding of risk and protective processes on suicide death in the Mid-Atlantic region. The aims of this project include identifying and merging existing clinical data sources (e.g., medical examiner, claims, hospital discharges), geo-level data sources and other clinical data (e.g., built environment, electronic health records), and aggregated administrative data (e.g., school, incarceration, gun ownership). Our team will develop predictive models using machine learning and natural language processing algorithms. These models will be enhanced using spatial algorithms to detect the geo-clustering of suicide. The generalizability of data sources and analytic methods will be tested in the Johns Hopkins Clinical Research Network across the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States (Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, and West Virginia) to evaluate data availability, quality and data linkage feasibility. The methods of this project will be shared as a resource with other states and regions to establish a similar analytics framework to advance suicide prevention. Our team will develop national guidelines and technical support materials to facilitate data linkage and analysis based on common data sources available in most states. The project will offer essential benchmarks and measures for providers and payers to reduce suicide events in their systems.  PUBLICHEALTHRELEVANCE Suicide is a major preventable public health challenge. Over 44,000 people in the United States died by suicide in 2015 and rates have increased 24% since 1999. This study will conduct data linkage and informatics approaches to utilize existing resources to improve suicide risk identification and prevention.",Addressing Suicide Research Gaps: Understanding

"High throughput cell screening for toxic metal exposure Project Summary The overall objective of this research project is to develop a novel approach for high throughput screening of individual cells based on holographic imaging. To achieve this goal, we propose to implement a new quantitative phase imaging modality, holographic cytomtery, which incorporates several novel technical advances to enable high throughput imaging. Holographic cytometry (HC) will bring the high sensitivity of quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) to imaging of cells flowing through microfluidic devices. While QPM has been used for cell analysis previously, typically only a handful of cells have been imaged. To enable significant application of QPM for fundamental cell biology and clinical studies, it is necessary to move to a high throughput implementation. Technical advances needed to realize the high resolution HC system include use of high speed line scan cameras, microfluidic chips with multiple parallel channels, and light from a pulsed laser source to enable stroboscopic illumination. In order to efficiently analyze and process this data set, rapid analysis software will be developed that leverages the highly parallel processing capabilities of graphics processing units and machine learning algorithms to enable automated classification. The proposed HC method can be applied to imaging a wide range of flowing cells. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we will initially target the measurement of cancerous progression due to environmental toxicant exposure. We have conducted a preliminary study that shows QPM can detect early changes in the biomechanical properties of cells due to arsenic exposure. In the proposed project, we seek to develop QPM based biomarkers of pre-cancerous change that will enable rapid assessesment. QPM has not been implemented in such a format to date and thus is not yet a feasible approach for clinical or research studies. To meet the goal of high throughput imaging with QPM, the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1. Develop new instrumentation for high speed imaging using off axis digital holography. 2. Implement high throughput analysis methods based on machine learning 3. Test and validate high throughput system with pilot studies of heavy metal exposed epithelial cells to show the approach can detect early pre-cancerous changes due to environmental toxicant exposure. Upon completion of this project, we will have realized a high throughput imaging cytometry system for research and clinical applications. Project Narrative  The proposed research will develop a new high throughput cellular screening technology based on quantitative phase image of cells flowing in a microfluidic chip. This technology will allow researchers and doctors to obtain holographic images of every single cell in a sample in a short amount of time which can then be analyzed by a computer. This would offer the opportunity to evaluate the characteristics of populations of cells for understanding changes in public health due to environmental factors.",High throughput cell screening for toxic metal exposure,9610235,R21ES029791,"['Algorithms ', ' Arsenic ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computers ', ' Cytology ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Holography ', ' instrumentation ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' Motion ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Population Characteristics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' detector ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' data storage ', ' data retrieval ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Descriptor ', ' Image Cytometry ', ' Exposure to ', ' Morphology ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' tool ', ' Heavy Metals ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Scanning ', ' Stream ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' parallel processing ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Cytometry ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' high throughput analysis ', ' high throughput screening ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' shear stress ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Microfluidic ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Microfluidic Microchips ', ' microfluidic chip ', ' Microfluidic Lab-On-A-Chip ', ' Microfluidic Device ', ' Data ', ' Premalignant ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Resolution ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cell imaging ', ' cellular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' systems research ', ' digital ', ' toxic metal ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' nanometer sized ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nano scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nanoscale ', ' exposure to metal ', ' Metal exposure ', ' toxic exposure ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' Cancerous ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' parallel computing ', ' parallel computation ', ' parallel computer ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' Geometry ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' mechanical properties ', ' imaging approach ', ' ']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,209312,0.09658144489898784
"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes. This project aims to improve exposure therapy response for patients with social anxiety disorder by directly linking exposure therapy response to the neurobiology of extinction learning.",Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory,9526722,K23MH113708,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Extinction ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Loudness ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' learning extinction ', ' Funding ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' American ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' therapy prediction ', ' predict treatment response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' individualized medicine ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive marker ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' social anxiety ', ' Social Anxiety Disorder ', ' treatment of anxiety disorders ', ' anxious individuals ', ' anxious ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' improved outcome ', ' recruit ', ' responsive patient ', ' patient response ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2018,186408,0.09243850511789957
"Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) adolescents and adults, when compared to similar others, are at increased risk for suicide attempts and exposure to violence victimization. Suicide mortality is also elevated, especially among women, though research studies are sparse. Accordingly, NIH has formally designated sexual/gender minorities a health disparity population. Yet there remain large gaps in the scientific knowledge base that undermine development, dissemination and implementation of effective public health interventions to reduce risk in this vulnerable population. These include whether rates of homicide are similarly elevated among LGBT persons, whether suicide rates are elevated among the transgender population, what role gender and race/ethnicity play in shaping risk, as well as clarification of the contextual factors surrounding these deaths, including missed opportunities for intervention. The primary goal of the project is to identify patterns of risk and to characterize proximal factors associated with violent death due to suicide and homicide among LGBT individuals. Drawing from Minority Stress Theory and, for suicides, the `ideation-to-action' framework, we hypothesize that anti-gay stigma and discrimination creates a vulnerability for violent death among LGBT adolescents and adults. Capitalizing on new information classifying deaths for LGBT status in recent years of the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), we will make novel use of supervised machine learning techniques to recapture LGBT status among deaths in those 12 years and older in the 2003-2015 NVDRS (> 200,000 suicides, homicides, or homicide-suicides). Similar techniques will also be used to code NVDRS death narratives for co-occurring stigma-based contextual factors (e.g., gay disclosure, familial rejection), risk profiles (e.g. mental health, substance use), and recent services use in the immediate circumstances surrounding the death. This will allow us to achieve two study aims. For Aim 1, we will use NVDRS data and exogenous information estimating LGBT population size to generate state-level estimates of suicide and homicide rates, adjusted for population composition, among individuals 12 years and older. We hypothesize that LGBT population risk estimates for suicide and homicide will exceed those of non-LGBT populations. For Aim 2, we will identify sexual orientation and gender minority-linked differences in predisposing and proximal factors associated with suicide and homicide, including indicators of mental health and substance use, patterns of recent health care access, and characteristics of death circumstances, including HIV infection status. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we hypothesize that recent discrimination experiences will be strongly associated with sexual orientation and transgender status, that homicide deaths will more likely show evidence of hate-crime-related contextual factors, and that HIV-related issues will be an important though downward trending precipitant of suicide among sexual minority men. We also anticipate gender and ethnic/racial differences in these effects that will have important implications for future risk reducing interventions. Information obtained will greatly aid achieving the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Project 2025 goal of reducing the suicide rate 20% by 2025 and NIMH's Zero Suicide efforts by providing interventionists with data to design screening and intervention efforts for the LGBT population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project addresses an important public health problem—lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals likely experience higher rates of violent death, including suicide and possibly homicide, than other persons. Why this occurs has yet to be fully determined. This study investigates both predisposing and precipitating factors linked to violent death among LGBT individuals, age 12 years and older. Our goal is to identify modifiable, explanatory factors that can account for mortality disparities between LGBT and non-LGBT individuals.",Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable

"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. The proposed program will apply a novel dental biomarker of exposure to multiple chemicals and cutting-edge statistical methods to identify specific life stages including perinatal periods that correspond to increased susceptibility to neurodevelopmental effects of metal toxicant mixtures.",Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture,9554621,R01ES026033,"['Affect ', ' Arsenic ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexico ', ' Organic Chemicals ', ' Phenotype ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' 2nd trimester ', ' Third Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Third Trimester ', ' Last Trimester ', ' 3rd trimester ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' Work ', ' Zinc ', ' Zn element ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Chemicals ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Dental ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' neurotoxicology ', ' early childhood ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Nutrient ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Toxicogenetics ', ' Toxicology Genetics ', ' Genetic Toxicology ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' cost ', ' Neurodevelopmental Deficit ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' exposure to metal ', ' Metal exposure ', ' toxic exposure ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' eight years of age ', ' eight year old ', ' age 8 years ', ' 8 years of age ', ' 8 year old ', ' developmental neurotoxicity ', ' neurotoxic ', ' public health relevance ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' novel marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' early life exposure ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' high dimensionality ', ' perinatal phase ', ' perinatal period ', ' ']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,633419,0.04971421529302652
"Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide prevention is a significant public health priority. We have made great strides in understanding risk factors for suicidal behavior using conventional statistical methods; however prediction of suicidal behavior in practice remains poor. In 2014, NIMH and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Research Prioritization Task Force published A Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention: An Action Plan to Save Lives, which identified six key unanswered questions about suicide. The proposed project addresses the key unanswered question of ""how can we better or more optimally detect/predict risk?"" from the report. Specifically, the project addresses the following short and long term objectives associated with this unanswered question: (1) developing risk algorithms from health care data that can be used for suicide risk detection and (2) overcoming base rate challenges and response bias by identifying innovative biostatistical and other research methods. Recent advances in statistical methodology, including the application of machine learning methods in psychiatry, will allow us to capitalize on what has been learned from previous studies to propel forward our ability to predict suicidal behavior. The aims of this study are to examine immediate and long-term risk factors of three separate suicidal behavior outcomes including (a) suicidal ideation, (b) suicide attempt and (c) death from suicide to develop general population risk algorithms and elucidate novel interactions, both overall and among high risk subgroups. Further, we will use regression-based analyses to quantify the main effects of predictor variables and novel interactions. Study Design: This series of case-control studies will use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for suicidal behavior in the population of Denmark from 1994-2015. Extensive data on psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, prescriptions, social variables, and mortality have been routinely and rapidly recorded in national registries in Denmark for decades, allowing for the thorough examination of longitudinal predictors and the efficient examination of low base rate outcomes. Gender differences will be explored, as well as algorithms among high risk subgroups of the population (e.g., groups with psychiatric diagnoses). Implications: The current study addresses NIMH's research priorities of 1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and 2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH- supported research. This work will inform clinicians and policymakers regarding the patient groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts. In future work, risk algorithms developed as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools that can identify patients at risk for suicidal behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This expansive general population study will inform policymakers and public health practitioners about the groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts (i.e., what characteristic combinations confer the greatest risk for suicidal behavior among general population and high risk subgroups).

"MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide Project Summary  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents. In addition to deaths, 16% of adolescents report seriously considering suicide each year, and 8% make one or more attempts. Despite these alarming statistics, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. Thus, developing effective methods to improve short-term prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is critical.  Currently, our most robust predictors of STBs are demographic or clinical indicators that have relatively weak predictive value. However, there is an emerging literature on short-term prediction of suicide risk that has identified a number of promising candidates, including rapid escalation of: (a) emotional distress, (b) social dysfunction (i.e., bullying, rejection), and (c) sleep disturbance. Yet, prior studies are limited in two critical ways. First, they rely almost entirely on self-report. Second, most studies have not focused on assessment of these risk factors using intensive longitudinal assessment techniques that are able to capture the dynamics of changes in risk states. These are fundamental limitations. While suicidal ideation may precede an attempt by years, socio-emotional changes preceding a suicide attempt often occurs within the time span of minutes to hours. This study will capitalize on recent developments in real-time monitoring methods that harness adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology. Specifically, we now have the capacity to use: (a) smartphone technology to conduct intensive longitudinal assessments monitoring putative risk factors with minimal participant burden and (b) modern computational techniques to develop predictive algorithms for STBs.  The project will include high-risk adolescents (n = 200) aged 13-18 years recruited from outpatient and inpatient clinics: (a) recent suicide attempters with current ideation (n = 70), (b) current suicide ideators with no attempt history (n = 70), and (c) a psychiatric control group with no STB history (n = 60). Effortless Assessment of Risk States (EARS) will be used to continuously measure variables relevant to key risk domains—emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—through passive monitoring of participants' smartphone use. First, we will test between-group differences in risk factors during an initial 2-week period, and determine the extent to which risk factors derived from mobile phones improves discrimination over self-reported indicators. Second, we will use statistical techniques to test whether the risk factors improve short-term prediction of STBs (e.g., suicide attempts, hospitalization) during the 6-month follow-up period above and beyond clinical assessments. Third, computational machine learning techniques—based on a priori and learned features—will develop predictive models that utilize the full range of intensive longitudinal data collected by the active and passive monitoring methods to predict group membership and STB outcomes. Ultimately, by leveraging smartphone technology, we aim to improve the short-term STB prediction and provide clinicians and patients with reliable, scalable and actionable tools that will reduce the needless loss of life. Project Narrative Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and despite this pressing public health crisis, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. However, recent advancements in mobile technologies afford the capacity to monitor known risk factors—including emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—which has the potential to revolutionize our insight and clinical management of short- term risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, the present study will leverage adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology, along with advanced signal processing and computational modeling approaches, to identify promising short-term predictors of suicide among high-risk adolescents, which ultimately, may reduce needless loss of life.",MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide,9579491,U01MH116923,"['Academic

"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy. We will define the bigger-picture cellular networks and gene-environment interactions driving PSC by integrating multiple layers of -omics data.

Proper treatment of data types emerging from a diverse set of molecular and environmental profiling technologies cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical routines and new computational approaches are needed. In line with the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods and integrate large- scale genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect preterm birth (PTB) in diverse populations. Preterm birth, or the delivery of an infant prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is a major health concern. Infants born prematurely, comprising of about 12% of the US newborns, have elevated risks of neonatal mortality and a wide array of health problems. Preterm birth rates vary among different ethnic groups, with frequencies significantly elevated in African Americans and moderately elevated in Hispanics in comparison to Europeans. Environmental and socioeconomic factors alone may not explain these disparities and despite the evidence for a genetic basis to preterm birth, to date no causal genetic variants have been identified. In this proposal I aim to leverage the rich genetic and environmental variation data and develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of biology of preterm birth as it relates to all populations. To that extent, I propose three aims. In aim 1, I will develop computational methods to identify and validate novel genetic factors for preterm birth by genome-wide association (GWA) study in diverse ethnic populations. I obtained a comprehensive set of publicly available PTB case and control datasets consisting of ethnically diverse mothers and babies including 3,500 cases and nearly 16,000 controls from dbGAP and will carry out an ancestry-based case-control GWA study to identify genetic factors influencing PTB. In aim 2, I will develop analytical methodology to identify environmental and socioeconomic factors that impact preterm birth in diverse ethnic populations. I propose to integrate linked California State databases covering over 3 million births across diverse populations with geographical location data and pollution levels and UV exposure data from the Environmental Protection Agency in order to identify whether these exposures play a role in contributing to population-specific PTB risk. In aim 3, I will carry out integrative data analysis and build computational models in order to identify population specific interactions between the genetic and environmental factors affecting PTB risk. I hypothesize that gene-environment interactions contribute to population differences in preterm birth risk following environmental exposures. The proposed work will allow us to learn more about the etiology PTB, but could also be extended to other phenotypes of interest. This project is the logical next step for the study of the interaction of genetics and environment in the context of disease, which can be used to inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. The goal of this proposal is to develop computational approaches to integrate diverse genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect disease in diverse populations and apply them to the study of preterm birth. The methodology developed as part of this proposal can be extended and applied to other phenotypes of interest and inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic

"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with

"A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health,9517056,K99ES027022,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cognition ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Monitoring ', ' environmental testing ', ' Ecological Monitoring ', ' Ecologic Monitoring ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' New York City ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rotation ', ' Schools ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Urban Population ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' forest ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Distal ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Development Plans ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' experience ', ' pollutant ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' third grade ', ' 3rd grade ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ontology ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epidemiological model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' early life exposure ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' health data ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Data Science ', ' urban children ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Child Health ', ' ']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K99,2018,98444,0.13313316656714494
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9524072,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol

"Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity Project Summary/Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a known neurotoxin that tens of thousands of workers are exposed to daily, but it is unknown if the current safety guidelines are appropriately strong or too weak to protect them. In an ideal world knowledge of the exposure history of an individual should allow to predict specific risks for health effects. To monitor the effect of Mn welding fumes on workers, the medical imaging techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) are used to non-invasively image the structure, function, and neurochemistry in the human brain. However, currently studies are not making adequate strides in connecting Mn exposure to changes in MRI or MRS. Studies are only correlating Mn exposure to imaging parameters without taking into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the metal or the individual exposure history, thus lacking the ability to interpret individual data. The broad objective of this project is to fill this crucial gap by creating and validating mathematical models that take into account imaging data, pharmacokinetic properties of Mn and the individual exposure to Mn to predict individual effects of toxicity. Our group runs an ongoing, longitudinal neuroimaging study on local welders and matched controls. Thus we will have abundant and longitudinal data on brain MRI (e.g. T1 maps to assess the brain Mn burden), MRS data on several neurochemicals including GABA, data from personal air sampling and work history questionnaires, neurological and neuropsychological test results, and other biomarkers (toe nails, blood) at our disposal for modeling. The purpose of the current project is to assess and describe how knowledge on exposure and pharmacokinetic properties of Mn enables the interpretation of imaging data as quantitative brain Mn deposition, and how brain-region specific Mn deposition affects neurochemistry in other regions of the brain from where it is deposited. Aim 1 seeks to use MRI structural imaging and known pharmacokinetic properties of Mn to create a mathematical model that can determine the amount of Mn deposition in specific regions of the brain. Aim 2 investigates how the amount, the duration, and the location of Mn deposition in the brain affects neurochemistry. The results of this study will be a first step towards monitoring of individual risks from Mn toxicity by providing the necessary tools to translate exposure information to changes in the brain and consequent health symptoms. Importantly, a better interpretation of individual imaging data will also inform safety guidelines for the individual worker. Project Narrative Manganese (Mn) toxicity leads to disruptive symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease but has no known treatment or cure. Therefore, the prevention, rather than the treatment, of these toxic effects is the first priority for welders, smelters, and other workers exposed to Mn. The goal of this research is to create mathematical models that can predict measureable health consequences from manganese exposure using medical imaging and individual exposure data.",Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity,9494372,F31ES028081,"['Safety ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Welding ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Measures ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Workplace ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Toenail ', ' Toe Nail ', ' Structure of nail of toe ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' Test Result ', ' Occupational ', ' cohort ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Prevention ', ' Intoxication ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' air sampling ', ' Normalcy ', ' Normalities ', ' Brain region ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pharmacokinetic model ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' imaging spectroscopy ', ' spectroscopic imaging ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' human exposure ', ' exposed human population ', ' movement limitation ', ' movement impairment ', ' motor impairment ', ' multimodality ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' translational impact ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' GABA ', ' Aminalone ', ' Aminalon ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Maps ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neurochemical ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Poisons ', ' toxic compound ', ' poison ', ' Toxic Substance ', ' Toxic Chemical ', ' Probability ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' ']",NIEHS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,0.08384191880139723
"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",9573304,R01ES027747,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Animals ', ' Arsenic ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Carbon ', ' Carbon Black ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cognition ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Metals ', ' Nitrates ', ' NO3- ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Suggestion ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Trace Elements ', ' Trace Mineral ', ' Biometals ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Vesicle ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pollution ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Particulate ', ' Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates ', ' sulfate ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Visit ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' cohort ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' RNA marker ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Public Health Applications Research ', ' Public Health Applications ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' toxic metal ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' novel marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive performance ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' extracellular vesicles ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' ']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2018,755603,0.0384963578669223
"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",9593921,R01MH100155,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Anxiety ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Future ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Oppositional Defiant Disorder ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Glean ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' success ', ' Expressed Sequence Tags ', ' ESTs ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' trend ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' computerized ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' youth depression ', ' pediatric depression ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' child depression ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' suicidal youth ', ' suicidal adolescent ', ' high risk ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Positive Valence ', ' prospective test ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' recruit ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' adolescent suicide ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,797747,0.06510525589135115
"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution

"Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram Abstract The current project proposes an innovative professional development (PD) program in environmental health research experiences for science high-school teachers from schools with high poverty levels in North Carolina. In a collaborative effort, experts from the College of Education and scientists affiliated with the Center for Human Health and Environment (CHHE), and the Comparative Medicine Institute (CMI) at NC State University will provide teachers (N=40) with unique authentic lab experiences. The 8-week summer research PD program aims at enhancing teachers' environmental health literacy and research skills that will support novel science teaching strategies. The specific aims addressed by the program are the following: 1) to provide teachers with a practical understanding of the scientific method in mentored research projects examining links between environmental stressors and health; 2) to provide teachers with an understanding of core conceptual issues in toxicology; 3) to train teachers in ethical issues in scientific conduct, science communication, and public health; 4) to immerse teachers in authentic research lab experiences by using a cognitive apprenticeship model; and 5) to develop a comprehensive evaluation plan in order to assess the short- and long- term PD outcomes. In the proposed environmental health science (EHS) research PD program, teachers will be integrated into genuine research projects and attend lab meetings, gaining general knowledge of how research is conducted and specialized knowledge related to ongoing projects in their host lab. Additionally, teachers in the program will come together one day per week in a workshop environment, to share their diversity of research experiences and gain additional training in biological concepts and ethical issues related to environmental health sciences. Project Narrative Environmental health research experiences are often inaccessible to high-school teachers, particularly in high-poverty schools. Our PD program will provide teachers with scientific knowledge and resources to improve their classroom instruction by adopting a curriculum grounded in environmental health research. Further, teachers' newly acquired EHS knowledge and research skills have the potential to improve student science learning, and promote interest and readiness for STEM careers. By exposing students to novel instructional strategies, students will acquire not just STEM specialized knowledge, but develop STEM domain identification.

"Predictive modeling: the role of opioid use in suicide risk PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Suicide deaths and opioid-related overdose deaths have both been increasing in recent years. These two public health crises have substantial overlap: our preliminary work suggests that between 22% and 37% of opioid-related overdoses are suicides or suicide attempts. Healthcare settings are ideal places to intervene to prevent suicides, however clinicians need better tools to recognize the patients at greatest risk. We developed models that predict risk of suicide attempt or death with 83% to 86% accuracy. However, these models do not include important opioid-related variables. In a parallel body of work, we developed algorithms based on coded electronic health record (EHR) data to identify opioid-related overdoses and classify them as unintentional or intentional suicides. The proposed project integrates these two existing lines of research. Our suicide risk prediction dataset includes seven large healthcare systems and approximately 20 million visits by 3 million patients; it is currently being expanded to include additional outcomes and visits through 2016, and additional predictors, however inclusion of opioid-related variables was not part of the funded supplement. In the proposed study, we will determine whether including variables related to illicit and prescribed opioid use, opioid use disorder, discontinuation or significant dose reductions of prescription opioids, or prior non-fatal opioid-related overdoses improves predictions of suicide attempts or death within 90 days following an outpatient healthcare visit. We will also develop models that specifically predict opioid- related suicide attempts and deaths in the sample as a whole and among people prescribed opioid medications, and determine if the predictors of opioid-related suicide attempts or deaths are consistent for men and women. The goal of the proposed work is to maximize the performance of our models in order to create the best available tools for clinicians to help reduce future suicides. We have an established collaboration with the largest national EHR vendor and are working to develop an EHR-based, point-of-care clinical tool to predict suicide attempts and deaths based on our research findings. This work will therefore have a direct impact on clinical practice by providing clinicians with an efficient, evidence-based tool to evaluate suicide risk. The work will also provide critical data on understudied opioid-related predictors and moderators of suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicides and opioid-related overdoses have many overlapping risk factors, and both have been increasing over the past decade, causing concern that many overdose deaths may actually be suicides. We developed robust models to predict suicide attempts and deaths following outpatient healthcare visits. We also developed algorithms to identify opioid-related overdoses and classify them as unintentional or intentional suicides. In the proposed project these lines of work converge to identify important, understudied opioid-related predictors and moderators of suicide risk.",Predictive modeling: the role of opioid use in suicide risk,9593829,R01DA047724,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Heroin ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Inpatients ', ' Joints ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Overdose ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sales ', ' Savings ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Time ', ' Vendor ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' suicide mortality ', ' suicide mortality rate ', ' suicidal mortality ', ' Prevention ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Sentinel ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Health Care Visit ', ' Healthcare Visit ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' sex ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' suicide rate ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' clinical practice ', ' overdose death ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' prescription opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' opioid medication ', ' opiate medication ', ' licit opioid ', ' prescription opioid ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opiate use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opioid use ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opioid overdose ', ' illicit opiate ', ' illicit opioid ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' preventable mortality ', ' preventable death ', ' ']",NIDA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,501445,0.14670036159770225
"Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually. Despite ongoing efforts to reduce the burden of suicide and suicidal behavior, rates have remained relatively constant over the past half century. Attempts to predict suicidal behavior have relied almost exclusively on self-reporting of suicidal thoughts and intentions. This is problematic because of well-known reporting biases and the fact that many people at high risk are motivated to deny suicidal thoughts to avoid hospitalization. Even though the majority of all suicide decedents have contact with a healthcare professional in the month before their death, suicide risk is rarely detected in such cases. Efforts to identify risk factors have also been stymied by the fact that suicide is a low-base rate event so that very large samples are needed to test the complex combinations of factors that are likely to contribute to risk. The widespread adoption of longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) has created a powerful but still under-utilized resource for detecting and predicting important health outcomes. In prior work using machine learning methods to analyze structured EHR data, we have developed predictive models that detect up to 45% of first-episode suicidal behavior, on average 3 years in advance. Here we aim to systematically extend and improve our EHR prediction methods in a large healthcare system (N = 4.6 million patients) by incorporating 1) external public record datasets (LexisNexis SocioEconomic Health Attribute data) that include environmental, socioeconomic, and life event information; 2) natural language processing (NLP) to leverage unstructured EHR text, including text-based scores that capture RDoC domains; 3) a novel method of deriving temporal risk envelopes to capture the time-dependent effects of individual risk factors; and 4) clinical risk trajectories that incorporate ordered temporal sequences of risk factors. We will systematically compare the performance of each of these approaches to identify optimal strategies for enhancing risk surveillance and prediction in healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would represent a crucial step towards novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually, with 1.4 million attempting suicide annually. Unfortunately, efforts to identify those at high risk have had limited success. We have previously used machine learning methods to predict risk of suicidal behavior using the vast resources of data available in electronic health records. The proposed research will extend and improve this work by leveraging external datasets, medical record notes, and trajectories of risk over time to facilitate novel, clinically relevant, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior.",Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets,9593994,R01MH117599,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Calibration ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chronology ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Legal ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Information Resources ', ' knowledge resources ', ' knowledge resource ', ' information resource ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Text ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' process reproducibility ', ' process repeatability ', ' Outcome ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' high risk ', ' electronic structure ', ' clinical risk ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' discrete time ', ' improved outcome ', ' data resource ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,547151,0.10587873153326578
"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern. Understanding how these various exposures relate to POAG and it's subtypes will highlight disease prevention strategies and precision medical treatment options for this potentially blinding disease that requires lifetime management.",Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma,9519600,R01EY015473,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A ', ' S-acetate Coenzyme A ', ' Acetyl CoA ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Archives ', ' Arginine ', ' L-Arginine ', ' Axon ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Citrulline ', ' Control Groups ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Genes ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Physiologic Intraocular Pressure ', ' intra-ocular pressure ', ' Ocular Tension ', ' Intraocular Pressure ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Morbidity -

"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9761612,R00ES027022,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cognition ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Monitoring ', ' environmental testing ', ' Ecological Monitoring ', ' Ecologic Monitoring ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' New York City ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rotation ', ' Schools ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Urban Population ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' forest ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Distal ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Development Plans ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' experience ', ' pollutant ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' third grade ', ' 3rd grade ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ontology ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epidemiological model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' early life exposure ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' health data ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Data Science ', ' urban children ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Child Health ', ' ']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2018,247463,0.13313316656714494
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans.

"Functional Dissection of Prenatal Drug Effects on the Developing Brain and Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY Despite efforts of prevention and education programs, licit and illicit drug use among pregnant women remains prevalent1. Most drugs of abuse easily cross the placenta and can alter the intricate balance among fetal neurotransmitters and receptors, which critically dictate in utero development of the brain's functional wiring system2-5. Therefore prenatal drug exposures (PDE) have long-lasting implications for brain and behavioral development since a small perturbation to the immature brain circuits may cascade into substantial deviations during long-term growth6. Existing behavioral studies provide converging evidence on the detrimental effects of PDE throughout development 1,6,7 but mechanistic studies of the brain basis of PDE remains scarce, especially during the infancy period. Nevertheless, studying the brain mechanisms of PDE during infancy is critical and urgently needed given that: 1) the infancy period immediately follows PDE insults and features the most dynamic postnatal brain development; 2) the infancy period is least confounded by postnatal environmental adversities that frequently accompany PDE; 3) identification of brain alterations associated with PDE during this stage has the best potential to guide early preventive intervention before behavioral problems onset. Our previous results8,9 demonstrated significant and widespread functional connectivity alterations in neonates prenatally exposed to cocaine and marijuana, respectively. However, three major areas need to be better delineated: 1) an overall picture of PDE effects on whole brain functional organization is lacking; 2) a more systematic delineation of the potential differential drug effects and their interactions is needed given the multi- drug exposure for most of the drug-abusing mothers; 3) the prediction power of detected neonatal functional alterations for later behavioral outcomes remains to be determined. Our long-term goal is to derive early functional-connectivity-based brain biomarkers for different PDEs that will reliably predict long-term behavioral outcomes. Our goal in this project is to derive neonate-based functional connectivity signatures for different PDEs and test their prediction power for 3-month behavioral outcomes. This project is significant because it is expected to be the first to identify drug-specific neurophenotypes for different PDEs on early brain functional and behavioral development, prior to the damaging postnatal influences that may accompany parental drug abuse. It is innovative because: 1) It will integrate resting-state brain functional connectivity and cognitive and behavioral function to quantify the potential drug-specific and drug-common effects on brain and behavior development in neonates; 2) It will apply detailed multi-level whole brain survey to discern differential drug-effect profiles and leverage advanced machine learning algorithms to better characterize their link with later behavioral outcomes. It is relevant to public health because it will provide currently unavailable knowledge of PDE effects on developing brain functional networks in neonates and inform earlier interventions that are documented to be most effective before symptom onset.

"Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a four-year study of cognitive markers of late-life suicide. Our overarching goal is to find factors predictive of high-lethality suicidal behavior in late life. Extending the stress-diathesis model, our research program seeks to understand how trait-like diatheses - impaired cognitive control, deficits in social processing, and impulsivity - are expressed in poor decisions, both in experimental paradigms and in the context of real-world decision making. Our current cross-sectional study focuses on cognitive correlates of late-life suicidal behavior, linking it to poor cognitive contro. Adding to a growing body of evidence, we have preliminary evidence that older suicide attempters are impaired in their decision-making. Further, we have important clues about dimensions of heterogeneity in suicidal behavior. We see that high-lethality suicide attempters struggle in complex environments and make poor social decisions. By contrast, we see a tendency toward short-sighted decisions falling under the broad category of impulsivity in people with low-lethality and unplanned suicide attempts. The proposed study examines the cognitive and neural underpinnings of disadvantageous decisions in individuals with high-lethality attempts. We propose to (i) relate cognitive control deficits to poor decision-making in complex, ambiguous environments in older suicide attempters, (ii) to describe neural system alterations that may underlie poor cognitive control and disadvantageous decisions, (iii) to extend our investigations to poor social decisions that may contribute to late-life suicidal behavior, and (iv to develop an algorithm for predicting suicide risk that incorporates these features in addition to established risk factors. These goals will be accomplished by two interlinked studies. Study I is a cross-sectional, case- control comparison of 70 high-lethality suicide attempters, 70 low-lethality suicide attempters, 70 non-suicidal depressed, and 50 non-psychiatric controls. We focus on older suicide attempters, as suicide rates are high in old age and because late-life suicide attempts, due to their serious and determined nature, offer a window into death by suicide. Study I will use a framework that combines behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience, with multilevel clinical, behavioral, cognitive, and imaging assessments. Our sampling and assessment strategy was designed with particular attention to possible confounders. Study II will follow 250 older suicide attempters (110 enrolled to date + 140 newly recruited) for up to 4 years, capturing recurrent attempts. It will serve as a prospective validatin of our predictive model. The extensive clinical and behavioral/cognitive characterization combined with a machine learning approach will allow us to develop an algorithm for suicide risk prediction which can inform clinical practice. The investigative team includes experts in reward learning and model-based imaging (Dombrovski), geriatric neuroimaging (Aizeinstein), behavioral economics (De Bruine), analysis of neural and longitudinal data (Weissfield), decision neuroscience (Clark), neuropsychology of suicide (Keilp) and of geriatric depression (Butters). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, about 6000 people aged 65 and older die by suicide in the US, with non-fatal suicide attempts numbering at least 2-4 times as many; however, clinicians lack tools for identifying those at risk and targeted treatments. Suicide follows a decision process, and recent studies have shown that suicidal individuals are often bad at making decisions in other situations; this study specifically explores patterns of decision-making seen in older people with near-lethal suicide attempts.",Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide,9489301,R01MH085651,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Butter ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Corpus striatum structure ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' Diathesis ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Gambling ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Punishment ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' K-18 conjugate ', ' K18 combination ', ' K18 ', ' K-18 ', ' falls ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Parietal ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' preference ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' comparison group ', ' late life depression ', ' Elderly depression ', ' geriatric depression ', ' cost ', ' neglect ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' suicidal individual ', ' suicide attempter ', ' BOLD response ', ' blood oxygenation level dependent response ', ' cognitive control ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavioral economics ', ' biological heterogeneity ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' recruit ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,482739,0.123111182445826
"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed. We propose studies using computational methods to determine how antibody decay data may help us estimate cholera exposure incidence.",Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data,9595726,R01AI135115,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Antibodies ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cholera ', ' Cholera Vaccine ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diarrhea ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Future ', ' Haiti ', ' Health care facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Household ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Joints ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sanitation ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Vibrio cholerae ', ' Vibrio comma ', ' V.cholerae ', ' V. cholerae ', ' V cholerae ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Caring ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Serologic ', ' Serological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Logistics ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Spottings ', ' Genetic ', ' Vibrio cholerae O1 ', ' Vibrio cholerae Serogroup O1 ', ' V. cholerae Serogroup O1 ', ' V. cholerae O1 ', ' V cholerae Serogroup O1 ', ' V cholerae O1 ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' fighting ', ' Oral ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Surveillance Methods ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' Antibody Response ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Haitian ', ' Bangladeshi ', ' Disease Surveillance ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2018,750105,0.1006323199366783
"Spatiotemporal Risk Assessment Modeling of Chemical Mixtures Project Summary: Comprehensive exposure assessments that account for mixtures of environmental chemical pollutants are vital to understand true relationships between human exposures and disease outcomes. Moreover, human or daily mobility of people is often misrepresented by exposure models resulting in exposure misclassification. This proposal aims to determine how air pollution chemical mixtures and human mobility impact environmental and human health risk assessments, which aligns with the NIEHS core mission “to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives.” The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. The primary mentor, Dr. Kim Anderson, a professor at Oregon State University is an expert in passive exposure assessment methods and analytical quantification of chemical mixtures in environmental media, which provides an excellent environment to transition the candidate from a background in single-pollutant exposure assessment to multi-pollutant mixture exposure and risk assessment. Along with new teaching opportunities, the candidate will receive training from Dr. Anderson in research methods such as primary data collection, biochemical monitoring for epidemiological studies, and toxicology approaches in risk assessment. Collaborators Drs. Katrina Waters and Justin Teeguarden, senior scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, will provide career development advising and research training in areas such as data integration for epidemiology and toxicology studies and hands-on experience with large-scale computational resources. This proposal’s aims will address the following central hypotheses: (1) Accounting for chemical mixtures in exposure will produce synergistic health effects not observed by chemicals individually, and (2) Personal sampling and model-based exposure assessment accounting for human mobility will produce varying risk estimates depending on the pollutant and individuals’ mobility. During the K99 phase, aim 1 will collect multi-chemical air quality data for a daily time resolved stationary monitoring campaign resulting in a space and time resolved multi-pollutant (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds) air quality dataset. Aim 2 will develop spatiotemporal exposure models for gas-phase mixtures using land use regression, geostatistical, and machine learning models. In the R00 phase, aim 3 will perform a risk assessment for chemical mixtures and acute lung health effects accounting for human mobility using a case-crossover design and comparing three exposure assessment methods: traditional spatiotemporal models, spatiotemporal models accounting for human mobility, and personal exposure monitors. Together, this proposal addresses the major limitations in environmental exposure assessment, pollutant mixtures and human mobility, and is within the mixtures and air pollution focus areas of environmental exposure research at NIEHS. Project Narrative The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. This study will validate spatiotemporal statistical approaches in chemical mixture exposure modelling, evaluate the cumulative effects of chemical mixtures in air pollution and acute lung health effects, and determine the extent of exposure misclassification due to human mobility.

"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9538116,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cognition ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environment ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Maternal Behavior ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mothers ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Glean ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' intraparietal sulcus ', ' disability ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Parietal ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' Fetal Cocaine Exposure ', ' prenatally cocaine exposed ', ' prenatal cocaine exposure ', ' gestational cocaine exposure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' response ', ' neurobehavior ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Future Generations ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' neonate ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' drugs abused ', ' drug abused ', ' abused drugs ', ' abused drug ', ' drug of abuse ', ' impaired behavior ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' effective intervention ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' exposure to cocaine ', ' exposed to cocaine ', ' cocaine-exposed ', ' cocaine exposure ', ' learning competence ', ' learning achievement ', ' learning ability ', ' cognitive development ', ' cognitive ability ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' maternal care giving ', ' maternal caregiving ', ' neonatal brain ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' gender difference ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,679633,0.03289520685834932
"Suicide Death Among Older Adults Receiving Residential Long-term Care Project Summary/Abstract  Suicide is among the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. and suicide risk increases substantially after age 65. Nearly 70% of individuals currently 65 years old will require long-term care during the remainder of their lives. The nation's 15,000 nursing homes are an important setting providing residential post-acute and long-term care to over 3 million older and disabled Americans every year, and the nation's 30,000 assisted living facilities provided a home to about 800,000 elders during 2013-14. Residents in the 2 types of long-term care facilities are often socially isolated, physically and cognitively disabled, and diagnosed with multiple mental and medical conditions, all of which are associated with suicide in older adults. As a result, they may show elevated risk taking their own lives compared to community-living elders despite the fact that long-term care facilities are able to monitor closely the daily activities of their residents. However, the actual suicide risk among these residents is largely unknown. Moreover, it is expected that organizational characteristics and overall ability of long-term care facilities to provide safe and high quality of care play an important role in shaping the risk of suicide for residents at different points of care. However, empirical evidence on these questions is extremely limited. This study proposes to evaluate systematically the risk for suicide mortality among nursing home and assisted living residents, estimate suicide risk for nursing home residents at different points of care using longitudinal resident assessment records, and determine the associations of organizational characteristics and state policies with risk-adjusted suicide death rate. Organizational characteristics will be measured by nursing home structural factors (e.g. profit status), overall quality of care (e.g. measured by nurse staffing level), and organizational-level patient safety culture. This project will link the longitudinal National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) and National Death Index (NDI) files to nursing home Minimum Data Sets (MDS) and Medicare beneficiary data, as well as other facility and state policy files. These data will be used to model resident risk for suicide death using cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods, quantify the variations in risk-adjusted suicide death rates at different levels (i.e. facility, region, and state levels), and test the hypotheses regarding organizational and policy impacts on suicide death. The information generated in this project will contribute to the knowledge of suicide burdens among the most vulnerable elders in need of residential long-term care. The knowledge gained will inform future organizational- and policy-level interventions to prevent suicide among elders receiving long-term care. Project Narrative This study proposes to evaluate systematically the risk for suicide mortality among nursing home and assisted living residents, and to determine the associations of organizational characteristics and state policies with risk-adjusted suicide death rate.

"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices1-4. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children5-7. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes8-10. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides11. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures12,13, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized14,15. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid16. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California17-20, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind21,22, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics23 to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,9598047,K99ES028743,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Algorithms ', ' Arizona ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Birth Certificates ', ' California ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Chlorpyrifos ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Humidity ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicaid ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Parents ', ' Pesticides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' cypermethrin ', ' supermethrin ', ' supercypermethrin ', ' Permethrin ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' excretion ', ' Excretory function ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Ingestion ', ' Measurement ', ' Spottings ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Performance ', ' pyrethroid ', ' early childhood ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' case control ', ' Melissa ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' urinary ', ' pesticide exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' toxic exposure ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Learning Skill ', ' study population ', ' agricultural pesticide ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K99,2018,81281,0.12407171725864077
"Enhancing and extending the reach of suicide surveillance in tribal communities PROJECT SUMMARY The parent grant “Southwest Hub for American Indian Youth Suicide Prevention Research” (U19 MH113136-01) aims to develop and test culturally appropriate prevention strategies, conduct outreach and dissemination within and across tribal communities, and enable key stakeholders to make science-based policy and related decisions. The overall goal is to leverage a collaborative network of tribal leaders, investigators, interventionalists, service providers and service users in the Southwest region to reduce suicide in American Indian youth ages 10-24. An administrative supplement is requested in order to build on our existing data collection platform to be more scalable and efficient when used across tribal settings. In collaboration with colleagues at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, we will set up the data collection platform to incorporate additional sites and capitalize on preliminary machine learning work to create easily interpretable risk flags that can help case-managers prioritize cases to reach and connect to care. This work will contribute to a better understanding of how to scale community based m-health platforms for use across diverse settings and how to operationalize and implement machine learning algorithms to help improve care.

"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution

"Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction ABSTRACT In the next 60 minutes, at least 57 people in the United States (US) will attempt to kill themselves, and five will die. Over 80% of these individuals encountered a healthcare provider in the 12 months before his or her death, but their risk will have gone undetected or, if detected, poorly quantified and not sufficiently monitored longitudinally. The proposed research will address this deficit by building and validating the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale -- Expanded (CAT-SS EXPANDED), software that can screen for, quantify, and monitor suicide risk in a way far superior to existing instruments. It will enable at least three key Zero Suicide performance elements, including systematic, standardized frontline suicide risk screening and measurement (Identify), tracking and communicating risk across locations of care (Transitions), and monitoring changes in patient outcomes resulting from continuous quality improvement activities (Improve). In a paradigm shifting innovation, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will not only comprise the first multi-dimensional CAT of its kind, it will import suicide risk indicators that have already been validated by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) directly from a health system’s electronic health record (EHR). This SBIR Fast Track has two phases. Phase 1 will build the CAT-SS EXPANDED, starting with well-established preliminary work and using iterative user testing with 20 clinician-patient dyads to refine the features. Phase 2 will have two Aims. The first Aim will validate the CAT-SS EXPANDED against an independent research clinician’s suicide risk stratification and suicidal behavior 24 weeks after the index visit (n=700). The second Aim will complete two-way integration of the validated CAT-SS EXPANDED into UMass’ EHR production environment and will evaluate clinical usability and acceptability with a new sample of ~30 suicide-risk enriched patients. Innovation and Impact: While traditional suicide screening tools exist, they are very limited, a conclusion supported by systematic reviews, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, and the NIMH. Because of these limitations, strong, well-validated clinical decision support to guide appropriate levels of care do not exist, reinforcing non-standardized and inefficient workflow, such as a tendency to conservatively order unnecessary emergency psychiatric evaluations. The CAT-SS EXPANDED will address these well-known measurement limitations using cutting edge strategies embodied in multi-dimensional CAT and EHR-derived risk indicators, an unprecedented capability impossible to achieve with existing measures. While this study focuses on the ED as a starting point because of its well-known risk burden and emerging literature supporting the value of universal suicide risk screening combined with brief interventions, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will be specifically designed and later tested as the first approach to suicide risk monitoring suitable for enterprise deployment across settings and locations of care, which is transformational for suicide prevention and fundamental to the Zero Suicide model’s emphasis on holistic system change. NARRATIVE  Having a psychometrically valid suicide risk instrument that efficiently screens for risk, provides risk stratification, and can be used across settings and easily integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) has tremendous potential to enable the enterprise implementation of the Zero Suicide model across an entire healthcare system, regardless of location of care. Because the software we will create and validate, the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale – Expanded, blends computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and EHR suicide risk indicators previously validated using advanced analytic approaches by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network, it is markedly different from existing instruments, which focus on a specific setting or patient population, rely on obsolete administration and psychometric methods, contain only screening capability with no monitoring components, and are not EHR-integrated in such a way as to tap into the data stored in the EHRs. This SBIR Fast Track proposal is necessary to keep pace with the burgeoning adoption of electronic patient reported outcomes and EHRs across healthcare and is foundational to the next step of designing better suicide interventions.",Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction,9774940,R44MH118780,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Tests ', ' Methods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Psychometrics ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Standardization ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Schedule ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' Equation ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' Performance ', ' professor ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' brief intervention ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Research Training ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Monitor ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' systematic review ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' suicide model ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' patient population ', ' secondary outcome ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' screening ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' ER patient ', ' ED patient ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' data visualization ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Self-Direction ', ' substance misuse ', ' Risk stratification ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' clinical decision support ', ' risk prediction model ', ' ']",NIMH,ADAPTIVE TESTING TECHNOLOGIES,R44,2019,224998,0.12740217908238702
"Spatiotemporal Risk Assessment Modeling of Chemical Mixtures Project Summary: Comprehensive exposure assessments that account for mixtures of environmental chemical pollutants are vital to understand true relationships between human exposures and disease outcomes. Moreover, human or daily mobility of people is often misrepresented by exposure models resulting in exposure misclassification. This proposal aims to determine how air pollution chemical mixtures and human mobility impact environmental and human health risk assessments, which aligns with the NIEHS core mission “to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives.” The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. The primary mentor, Dr. Kim Anderson, a professor at Oregon State University is an expert in passive exposure assessment methods and analytical quantification of chemical mixtures in environmental media, which provides an excellent environment to transition the candidate from a background in single-pollutant exposure assessment to multi-pollutant mixture exposure and risk assessment. Along with new teaching opportunities, the candidate will receive training from Dr. Anderson in research methods such as primary data collection, biochemical monitoring for epidemiological studies, and toxicology approaches in risk assessment. Collaborators Drs. Katrina Waters and Justin Teeguarden, senior scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, will provide career development advising and research training in areas such as data integration for epidemiology and toxicology studies and hands-on experience with large-scale computational resources. This proposal’s aims will address the following central hypotheses: (1) Accounting for chemical mixtures in exposure will produce synergistic health effects not observed by chemicals individually, and (2) Personal sampling and model-based exposure assessment accounting for human mobility will produce varying risk estimates depending on the pollutant and individuals’ mobility. During the K99 phase, aim 1 will collect multi-chemical air quality data for a daily time resolved stationary monitoring campaign resulting in a space and time resolved multi-pollutant (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds) air quality dataset. Aim 2 will develop spatiotemporal exposure models for gas-phase mixtures using land use regression, geostatistical, and machine learning models. In the R00 phase, aim 3 will perform a risk assessment for chemical mixtures and acute lung health effects accounting for human mobility using a case-crossover design and comparing three exposure assessment methods: traditional spatiotemporal models, spatiotemporal models accounting for human mobility, and personal exposure monitors. Together, this proposal addresses the major limitations in environmental exposure assessment, pollutant mixtures and human mobility, and is within the mixtures and air pollution focus areas of environmental exposure research at NIEHS. Project Narrative The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. This study will validate spatiotemporal statistical approaches in chemical mixture exposure modelling, evaluate the cumulative effects of chemical mixtures in air pollution and acute lung health effects, and determine the extent of exposure misclassification due to human mobility.

"Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Environmental exposure mixtures, especially when coupled with social stressors, have the potential to compromise developmental outcomes in children, but have been understudied. We will use a unique longitudinal dataset that tracks children from birth through early elementary school, in combination with new tools from modern data science, to disentangle the complex effects of these mixtures on educational outcomes.",Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures,9626424,R01ES028819,"['Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Birth Records ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Carbon Monoxide ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Cox Models ', ' Crime ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Geography ', ' Housing ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Mothers ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nitrogen Peroxide ', ' Nitrogen Dioxide ', ' North Carolina ', ' Ozone ', ' Particle Size ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Siblings ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Sulfurous Anhydride ', ' Sulfur Dioxide ', ' Taxes ', ' Time ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' Work ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' elementary school ', ' grade school ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' pollutant ', ' simulation ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' social stress ', ' deprivation ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' lead exposure ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Science ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' data resource ', ' rural environment ', ' Child Health ', ' ']",NIEHS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,499515,0.07283575399420043
"Predicting Suicide Attempts in Youth with Child Protective Services Contact The applicant, Mr. Geoffrey Kahn, proposes to identify key, modifiable predictors of attempted suicide among children and youth who have had contact with Child Protective Services (CPS), and quantify the impact of hypothetical preventive interventions that could be implemented for these children. This research will be the foundation of the applicant’s doctoral dissertation, and will serve as one component of a comprehensive training plan to prepare the applicant for a career in independent research. Mr. Kahn will be mentored by a team of co-sponsors and consultants with expertise in suicide prevention, advanced statistical methods, child welfare research, and the CPS system. He will complete coursework in analysis of complex survey data and machine learning methods, participate in working groups on suicide prevention, machine learning, and causal inference at the sponsoring institution, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and present his findings to diverse audiences. The advanced training and focused mentoring that Mr. Kahn will receive through this Fellowship will position him to conduct future, independent research studies on the prevention of suicide, particularly suicide among youth.  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth aged 15-24 years in the US. Suicide rates have been increasing for nearly two decades, with that increase accelerating in recent years. Children who have had contact with Child Protective Services are at increased risk for numerous mental health problems, including suicidal ideation and attempts. The opioid epidemic is thought to be contributing to an increase in the already substantial number of children entering the CPS system. Finally, suicide has been remarkably difficult to predict, with recent meta-analyses showing that most currently identified risk factors do not predict future suicide attempts or deaths significantly better than chance, and predictive accuracy has not improved over the last 50 years of research. Suicide is likely caused by interaction among numerous risk factors, but most studies have examined only single risk factors. New machine learning (ML) methods have been shown to out-perform traditional regression in predictive models, and there are classes of ML algorithms that can identify complex interactions among large numbers of variables. The applicant proposes a multi-part analysis of suicide risk factors among youth with CPS contact. The proposed project will: 1) assess the role of CPS case outcome on access to specialized mental health care and subsequent suicide attempt; 2) use machine learning methods to develop and validate a predictive model for suicide attempts; and 3) apply causal inference methods to quantify the impact of hypothetical interventions on the key risk/protective factors identified in the study.  The proposed project is consistent with NIMH’s strategic priorities, as it will elucidate complex groups of risk factors which contribute to suicidal behavior and identify the most promising targets for intervention. Project Narrative  The proposed project will identify key predictors of suicide attempts among children and youth who have had contact with Child Protective Services (CPS). Machine learning algorithms will be used to evaluate large numbers of variables and find clusters of factors, rather than single risk factors, that predict suicide attempts in a longitudinal cohort of youth. Finally, causal inference methods will be used to quantify the potential impact of intervening on key risk factors which have been identified AND have been determined to be feasible targets for preventive intervention after consulting with experts from the CPS system.",Predicting Suicide Attempts in Youth with Child Protective Services Contact,9834058,F31MH120973,"['Affect ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' child wellbeing ', ' child well being ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Child Welfare ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foster Home Care ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Parents ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Social Workers ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Supervision ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Administrator ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Training ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' foster care ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Consult ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' child protective service ', ' child protection services ', ' research study ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' abuse neglect ', ' neglect and abuse ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Institution ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 18 years of age ', ' stem ', ' service intervention ', ' reducing suicide ', ' reducing suicidality ', ' reduce suicide ', ' reduce suicidality ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opiate crisis ', ' protective factors ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,45016,0.1076395621426017
"Environmental Modifications in sub-Saharan Africa: Changing Epidemiology, Transmission and Pathogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax Malaria Environmental Modifications in sub-Saharan Africa: Changing Epidemiology, Transmission and Pathogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax Malaria Supplement Application PROGRAM SUMMARY The current Supplement application is developed under an NIH ICEMR award entitled “Environmental Modifications in Sub-Saharan Africa: Changing Epidemiology, Transmission and Pathogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax Malaria” (U19 AI129326). The overarching objective of this Supplement application is to facilitate malaria control and elimination efforts in Kenya and Ethiopia, the two study countries of our ICEMR, by obtaining entomological and socio-behavioral data needed for introducing new vector control tools and by identifying optimal combinations of vector interventions to achieve the maximum impact in reducing malaria burden. The Supplement application has three projects, each with multiple specific objectives. Project 1 will evaluate the impact of spatial repellents on pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors in MalariaSpheres, a contained semi-natural Anopheles ecosystem for studying mosquito behaviors in Kenya and Ethiopia. Project 2 will examine the social behavioral aspect of malaria vector control, especially the gaps between knowledge and mosquito control practice in the community and the underlying mechanisms for such gaps. Project 3 aims to develop an optimal malaria intervention strategy adaptive to local malaria risk, changing vector ecology, and supply chains, using a cluster randomized sequential, multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design. The research proposed in the Supplement application leverages the baseline data, infrastructure, and capacity established by the parent ICEMR and extends it to malaria control goal by generating data critically needed for future field trials of new mosquito control products, identifying new approaches to improve community engagement, and developing new strategies to improve the effectiveness of malaria vector control programs. As insecticide resistance is widespread in Africa and the effectiveness of the current first-line malaria vector control tools need to be improved, knowledge gained from this Supplement application will be valuable to malaria control, not only for the two countries studied under this ICEMR but also for other regions in Africa and potentially elsewhere. Project Narrative This Supplement application will determine the impact of new mosquito repellents on insecticide resistant malaria vectors, bridge the gap between community knowledge on malaria and actual practice in the field, and develop new vector control strategies to maximize the cost-effectiveness on malaria incidence reduction. The knowledge and results from this project will greatly facilitate the malaria control and elimination efforts in Kenya and Ethiopia.","Environmental Modifications in sub-Saharan Africa: Changing Epidemiology, Transmission and Pathogenesis of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax Malaria",9706616,U19AI129326,"['Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Anopheles Genus ', ' Anopheles ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Entomology ', ' artificial environment ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Ethiopia ', ' Future ', ' transfection vector ', ' Genetic Vectors ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' antibody-based immunity ', ' Humoral Immunities ', ' Incidence ', ' insecticide resistant ', ' Insecticide Resistance ', ' Insecticides ', ' Investments ', ' other than vaginal Irrigation ', ' other than vaginal Douching ', ' lavage therapy ', ' irrigation therapy ', ' Nonvaginal lavage ', ' Nonvaginal irrigation ', ' Lavage ', ' Irrigation ', ' Kenya ', ' knowledge of results ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Malaria ', ' Plasmodium vivax Malaria ', ' Vivax Malaria ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' Mosquito Control ', ' Mosquitoes ', ' Culicidae ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parasites ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' P.falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' P falciparum ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' P. vivax ', ' P vivax ', ' Plasmodium vivax ', ' Primaquine ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water ', ' Immunology ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' human migration ', ' Human Migration / Distribution ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Country ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' experience ', ' pyrethroid ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Resource Development ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' environmental change ', ' vector control ', ' vector ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment strategy ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' trial design ', ' malaria transmission ', ' social media ', ' cost-effectiveness evaluation ', ' evaluate cost-effectiveness ', ' Infrastructure ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,U19,2019,722400,0.013565903680994728
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with

"Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide prevention is a significant public health priority. We have made great strides in understanding risk factors for suicidal behavior using conventional statistical methods; however prediction of suicidal behavior in practice remains poor. In 2014, NIMH and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Research Prioritization Task Force published A Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention: An Action Plan to Save Lives, which identified six key unanswered questions about suicide. The proposed project addresses the key unanswered question of ""how can we better or more optimally detect/predict risk?"" from the report. Specifically, the project addresses the following short and long term objectives associated with this unanswered question: (1) developing risk algorithms from health care data that can be used for suicide risk detection and (2) overcoming base rate challenges and response bias by identifying innovative biostatistical and other research methods. Recent advances in statistical methodology, including the application of machine learning methods in psychiatry, will allow us to capitalize on what has been learned from previous studies to propel forward our ability to predict suicidal behavior. The aims of this study are to examine immediate and long-term risk factors of three separate suicidal behavior outcomes including (a) suicidal ideation, (b) suicide attempt and (c) death from suicide to develop general population risk algorithms and elucidate novel interactions, both overall and among high risk subgroups. Further, we will use regression-based analyses to quantify the main effects of predictor variables and novel interactions. Study Design: This series of case-control studies will use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for suicidal behavior in the population of Denmark from 1994-2015. Extensive data on psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, prescriptions, social variables, and mortality have been routinely and rapidly recorded in national registries in Denmark for decades, allowing for the thorough examination of longitudinal predictors and the efficient examination of low base rate outcomes. Gender differences will be explored, as well as algorithms among high risk subgroups of the population (e.g., groups with psychiatric diagnoses). Implications: The current study addresses NIMH's research priorities of 1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and 2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH- supported research. This work will inform clinicians and policymakers regarding the patient groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts. In future work, risk algorithms developed as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools that can identify patients at risk for suicidal behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This expansive general population study will inform policymakers and public health practitioners about the groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts (i.e., what characteristic combinations confer the greatest risk for suicidal behavior among general population and high risk subgroups). In future work, risk algorithms discovered as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools.",Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population,9689114,R01MH109507,"['Algorithms ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Denmark ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Future ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Patients ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Substance Dependence ', ' Substance Addiction ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Case Series ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' interest ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' novel ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicide death ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' public health priorities ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' ']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2019,353843,0.1175341016732534
"The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence Project Summary Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are the most common types of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in the world. VBD epidemics have been increasing over recent decades, with tickborne diseases having doubled in the last decade in the United States. Despite the increase in public health burden, over 80% of vector-control organizations lack preventative capabilities. Understanding the interplay between the environment, vectors, pathogens, and humans that expedite disease spread remains a challenge. The overarching goal of this project is to identify the key environmental and human drivers that have led to the emergence of VBDs. Current models that predict tickborne disease risk have oversimplified the process by focusing only on the vector, i.e. risk of tick exposure. A human’s risk of infection is not only a function of entomological risk but also of factors inherent to the individual including behavior or characteristics that increase susceptibility to disease. This project proposes a novel approach to tickborne disease prediction by developing a comprehensive model that incorporate pathogen population dynamics and human factors to predict disease risk. This study will investigate several pathogens vectored by the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis): Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic anaplasmosis), and Babesia microti (babesiosis). The central hypothesis is that the prediction of tickborne disease risk can be improved by using sophisticated statistical methods to identify environmental drivers that impact pathogen population dynamics while incorporating human demographic characteristics. The hypothesis will be addressed in the following aims: (1) Determine the current and historical population dynamic patterns of pathogens vectored by I. scapularis to predict pathogen distribution; (2) Determine the association between human characteristics and tick-borne disease risk in order to develop an improved spatial disease risk model. This model will allow the identification and quantification of factors that are associated with the emergence of tickborne diseases in New York State, which is geographically advantageous because it is representative of much of the natural environment that ticks encounter in the northeastern US including rapid and recent changes in climate and landscapes. The results of this project will be used to develop a public disease warning system that will use contemporary and future climate forecasts to monitor tick populations and predict potential disease outbreaks for areas with vulnerable populations. With climate forecasts predicting an increase in 2-3°C in temperature by 2100, there is uncertainty in how diseases will shift and a warning system will allow preparation accordingly. At the completion of the proposed research project, the applicant will have acquired the following skillsets through intensive, interdisciplinary mentorship: big data analysis, advanced statistics including Bayesian and machine learning methods, spatial analyses, and risk analysis. This will enable the applicant to succeed as an independent investigator to address the challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases. Project Narrative Vector-borne diseases are the most common types of emerging infectious diseases in the world and constitute major threats to public health. My project uses advanced statistical methods to uncover how interactions between environmental factors affecting pathogen population dynamics and human demographic characteristics determine human risk for three tick-borne diseases: Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. The results of my project will be used to create a risk map to predict the spatial and temporal occurrence of tickborne diseases, which can inform public health strategies in order to mitigate disease burden.",The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence,9758579,F31AI133871,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Babesia microti ', ' Babesiosis ', ' Piroplasmosis ', ' Babesia parasite infection ', ' Behavior ', ' Bite ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi ', ' lyme spirochete ', ' Lyme Disease Spirochete ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto ', ' B.burgdorferi ', ' B. burgdorferi ', ' B burgdorferi ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Dangerousness ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Entomology ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Granulocytic cell ', ' Granular Leukocytes ', ' Blood granulocytic cell ', ' granulocyte ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Lyme Borreliosis ', ' Lyme Disease ', ' Maps ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' New York ', ' geographic population ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Public Health ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' statistics ', ' Temperature ', ' Ixodida ', ' Ticks ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Tick-Borne Infections ', ' tickborne infection ', ' Tick-Borne Diseases ', ' tickborne illness ', ' tickborne disease ', ' tick-borne illness ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Black-legged Tick ', ' blacklegged tick ', ' Ixodid ticks ', ' Ixodes scapularis ', ' I. scapularis ', ' I scapularis ', ' Anaplasma phagocytophilum ', ' HGE Agent ', ' Ehrlichia phagocytophila ', ' Ehrlichia equi ', ' Cytoecetes phagocytophila ', ' Anaplasma phagocytophila ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Adopted ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Human Characteristics ', ' Human Nature ', ' Emerging Communicable Diseases ', ' Emerging Infectious Diseases ', ' model design ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Vector-transmitted infectious disease ', ' vectorborne infectious disease ', ' vectorborne illness ', ' vectorborne disease ', ' vector-borne illness ', ' Vector-transmitted disease ', ' Vector-borne infectious disease ', ' Vector-borne disease ', ' environmental change ', ' Ecological Change ', ' vector control ', ' vector ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' pathogen exposure ', ' anthropogenesis ', ' anthropogenic ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' cost effective ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' human disease ', ' vector transmission ', ' spatial temporal variation ', ' demographics ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Epidemiological trend ', ' Epidemiology trend ', ' Epidemiologic trend ', ' Anaplasmosis ', ' decision tree learning ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' human pathogen ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' infection risk ', ' regression trees ', ' tick-borne pathogen ', ' tickborne pathogen ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2019,45016,0.06112347247170777
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9747247,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cognition ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' marihuana ', ' Marijuana ', ' Maternal Behavior ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mothers ', ' Nicotine ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Testing ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Glean ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' intraparietal sulcus ', ' disability ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Parietal ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' fetal ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' Fetal Cocaine Exposure ', ' prenatally cocaine exposed ', ' prenatal cocaine exposure ', ' gestational cocaine exposure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Drug Exposure ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' response ', ' neurobehavior ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Future Generations ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' neonate ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' drug of abuse ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' drugs abused ', ' drug abused ', ' abused drugs ', ' abused drug ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' effective intervention ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' cocaine exposure ', ' exposure to cocaine ', ' exposed to cocaine ', ' cocaine-exposed ', ' learning ability ', ' learning competence ', ' learning achievement ', ' cognitive development ', ' cognitive ability ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' maternal caregiving ', ' maternal care giving ', ' neonatal brain ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,682492,0.03289520685834932
"Digital Monitoring of Agitation for Short-Term Suicide Risk Prediction Suicide is a prevalent and burdensome public health problem that warrants immediate attention. As the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, suicide claims the lives of more than 44,000 Americans each year. There is an urgent need to identify objective and clinically informative markers of imminent risk for suicidal behavior. Agitation, defined in DSM-5 as excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension, is listed as a warning sign for suicide by leading organizations and in widely used risk assessment protocols. Yet, prior research on the association between agitation and suicide has key methodological limitations (including related to the operationalization of agitation), which has resulted in minimal empirical evidence to support agitation as a proximal risk factor for suicide. Addressing this gap in knowledge has the potential for significant impact, including informing both the clinical assessment of suicide risk and the development of just-in-time interventions for detecting and responding to acute suicide risk. This project will overcome the limitations of prior suicide risk factor research by assessing multiple behavioral (motor activity and vocal features [e.g., volume, speaking rate, pitch]) and subjective components of agitation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a sample at elevated risk for suicide over a short, high-risk period. We will test the hypotheses that (1) objectively measured real-time indicators of agitation correlate with both momentary subjective ratings and validated, gold standard measures of agitation, and (2) both subjective and objective indicators of agitation improve prediction of short-term increases in suicide ideation, plan, and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. We propose to collect high-resolution self-report (e.g., ecological momentary assessment) and passive (e.g., accelerometer) data on agitation using smartphones and wearable sensors from psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicide ideation or attempt during inpatient treatment and the four weeks after discharge. Multi- level modeling and machine learning approaches will be implemented to examine (1) associations between objective and subjective real-time indicators of agitation and validated measures of agitation, and (2) the degree to which real-time indicators of agitation predict momentary fluctuations in suicidal ideation and suicide plan and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. The scientific aims of this study map onto the candidate’s training in three primary areas: (1) digital monitoring of high-risk patients, (2) advanced longitudinal multivariate data analysis, and (3) identification of behavioral and vocal biomarkers. The candidate’s training plan includes mentorship from Dr. Matthew Nock (primary mentor), Dr. Jordan Smoller (co- mentor), Dr. Maurizio Fava (co-mentor), and Drs. Rosalind Picard, Evan Kleiman, and Thomas Quatieri (consultants), as well as quantitative coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This mentored five-year award will propel the candidate to an independent patient- oriented research career focused on using scalable methods to advance suicide prediction and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE To make an impact on the rising rates of suicide, we must improve the ability to predict when and for whom suicidal behavior will occur. This project overcomes the methodological limitations of prior studies of risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors by studying a promising and clinically informative proximal risk factor for suicide (agitation) using mobile devices that provide high-resolution objective and subjective data, a high-risk sample (psychiatric inpatients), and a short period of high suicide risk (immediately following hospital discharge), and in combination with other distal and proximal risk factors.

"Using multimodal imaging and the RDoC framework to predict risk factors for suicide attempt Project Summary Suicide is one of the greatest challenges facing Society today. Although research to date has provided important insight into the risk factors for suicide, it has struggled to make a translational impact on preventing suicide. New research strategies are therefore vital. The RDoC framework offers a promising approach to researching suicide, by moving the focus away from mental illness as the primary predictor of suicide, towards an emphasis on transdiagnostic dimensions, novel predictors, and integration of multiple units of analysis. Identifying the neurobiology underlying the transdiagnostic risk factors for suicide is an important step in understanding the mechanisms that lead to suicide. The majority of neuroimaging research to date has been purely correlational in nature, and often fails to generalize outside of the study sample. Predictive modelling, on the other hand, uses cross-validation to increase generalizability, and allows for the prediction of behavior, which is likely to have greater real-world utility. In this proposal, we will use the RDoC framework, multimodal imaging and predictive modelling to identify the molecular and network-level underpinnings of risk factors for suicide in a large, transdiagnostic dataset. Specifically, we aim to use Connectome-based Predictive Modelling (CPM) to generate and validate predictive models of suicide risk factors (depression severity, impulsivity, executive dysfunction and sleep disturbances), transdiagnostically, based on existing functional connectivity data (aim 1). Further, convergent research implicates glutamate dysfunction in suicidality, and emerging evidence suggests a specific role for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in suicide and suicide-related behaviors. Subjects in the existing dataset also participated in PET imaging with and [18F]FPEB, a radioligand specific for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). We will investigate the association between mGluR5 and risk factors for suicide transdiagnostically (aim 2). Finally, we propose to integrate fMRI and PET data by using PET-weighted CPM to predict risk factors for suicide transdiagnostically (aim 3). Here, we will assess whether combining molecular and circuit-level units of analysis increases predictive performance and identifies novel predictive networks. In summary, we propose to use cutting-edge multimodal imaging, computational modelling and the RDoC framework in an innovative approach to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying risk factors for suicide across psychiatric disorders. Findings of the proposed study have the potential to inform risk models and identify novel molecular and network-level targets for preventative and treatment strategies that are critically needed to reduce the suicide rate. Project Narrative Suicide rates in the US are at their highest levels in over 3 decades. New research avenues need to be explored to elucidate the mechanisms that lead to suicide, and to identify novel targets for prevention and treatment strategies. In an innovative approach, we will combine the RDoC framework, MRI and PET imaging, and predictive modelling to provide novel insight into the neural mechanisms underlying risk factors for suicide in a transdiagnostic dataset including individuals with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder and healthy controls.",Using multimodal imaging and the RDoC framework

"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern. Understanding how these various exposures relate to POAG and it's subtypes will highlight disease prevention strategies and precision medical treatment options for this potentially blinding disease that requires lifetime management.",Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma,9788096,R01EY015473,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A ', ' S-acetate Coenzyme A ', ' Acetyl CoA ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Archives ', ' Arginine ', ' L-Arginine ', ' Axon ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Citrulline ', ' Control Groups ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Genes ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Glaucoma ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Human Genetics ', ' intra-ocular pressure ', ' Ocular Tension ', ' Intraocular Pressure ', ' Physiologic Intraocular Pressure ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting ABSTRACT Significance: As recent national controversy over Joint Commission mandates proves, universal suicide risk screening in emergency departments (ED) will not achieve widespread adoption because confusion remains around which specific risk indicators to assess, and clinicians fear that such screening will lead to massive surges in psychiatric evaluations. To address these two implementation barriers, the proposed study will derive a clinical decision rule to support universal risk detection and optimize patient care workflow in adult patients. Investigators: The Project Team has extensive expertise in ED-based suicide risk screening and assessment (Boudreaux, Larkin), clinical decision rule design (Boudreaux, Stiell), predictive analytics (Wang, Liu, Simon), machine learning and informatics (Liu, Simon), industrial engineering (Johnson), and healthcare economics (Clements). A Clinical Advisory Panel ensures that the proposal is grounded in the practical realities of the ED. Innovation: The proposed study will be the first to apply industry standards for deriving decision rules to suicide risk and will directly inform the controversy regarding the relative strengths and weaknesses of universal versus targeted screening. We will pioneer new statistical innovations for rule derivation and will integrate simulation of potential workflow impact using industrial engineering modeling and economic analyses. Approach: We have already developed a pool of empirically supported, clinician-acceptable candidate suicide risk indicators. Data on these candidate indicators will be collected by trained research staff on 500 adult medical patients and 500 adult psychiatric patients from a large ED. Participants will undergo a comprehensive suicide risk assessment by a research clinical psychologist blinded to the indicators who will assign the participant to a criterion reference risk group: Negligible, Mild-Moderate, or High risk. Participants will be followed for 24 weeks after the visit to assess suicidal behavior, our secondary outcome. In Aim 1, we will derive a universal screening decision rule for “all comers,” as well as a variant to be used with patients presenting with a psychiatric chief complaint (targeted). In Aim 2, we will test whether a previously validated risk stratification algorithm using data from the electronic health record improves the performance of the decision rules. In Aim 3, we will model the potential operational impact of the rules through dynamic modeling of clinical workflow and economic costs and assessing clinician and patient acceptability in a new sample of 100 ED clinician-patient dyads. Environment: UMass has demonstrated its capability to support this study through several key preliminary studies, including the ED-SAFE studies, System of Safety, and other suicide-related studies set in the ED. Impact: By providing clear, evidence-based recommendations on universal screening and optimized workflow using standards accepted by emergency clinicians, this study will address two pivotal barriers to universal suicide risk screening, transforming the “right thing” into the “easy thing” so it becomes the “usual thing.” NARRATIVE Effective prevention of suicide among adult emergency department (ED) patients hinges on two indispensable components: effective identification of all patients who are at risk for suicidal behavior, and successful delivery of effective interventions to those with risk. Because many ED patients have hidden risk and do not present with psychiatric chief complaints, universal screening has been recommended by several prominent groups, such as the Joint Commission and the Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention; however, two trenchant barriers prevent such universal screening from being widely implemented, namely, (1) lack of clarity around the specific indicators to use for screening and (2) fear that screening all-comers will cause ED workflow to come to a grinding halt because of surges in psychiatric evaluations and boarding. The proposed study will address these two barriers by deriving the first clinical decision rule for use with all ED patients using rigorous standards and procedures and modelling its impact on workflow and costs, thereby revolutionizing the field's ability to actualize the first indispensable component of suicide prevention: effective, efficient identification and triaging of suicide risk, both hidden and obvious.",Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting,9638873,R01MH118220,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Confusion ', ' Consultations ', ' Economic Models ', ' Economics ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychologist ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Triage ', ' Measures ', ' Emergency nurse ', ' Emergency Room Nursing ', ' Emergency Department nurse ', ' ER nurse ', ' ER Nursing ', ' ED nurse ', ' ED Nursing ', ' Emergency Nursing ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Blinded ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Adopted ', ' In Situ ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' health care economics ', ' healthcare economics ', ' economic cost ', ' Cervical spine ', ' Cervical Vertebrae ', ' Blunt Trauma ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Training ', ' Stratification ', ' Sum ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' suicidal patient ', ' suicide patient ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' secondary outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' common rule ', ' screening ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' ER patient ', ' ED patient ', ' Emergency Department-based Intervention ', ' ED-based intervention ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Industry Standard ', ' inferential statistics ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Self-Direction ', ' Risk stratification ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2019,843783,0.10017851386593336
"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes.

"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",9743863,R01MH100155,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Anxiety ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Future ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Institutes ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Oppositional Defiant Disorder ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Psychometrics ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Glean ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Evaluation ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' success ', ' Expressed Sequence Tags ', ' ESTs ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' trend ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' computerized ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' child depression ', ' youth depression ', ' pediatric depression ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' adolescent depression ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' suicidal adolescent ', ' suicidal youth ', ' high risk ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Positive Valence ', ' prospective test ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' recruit ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' adolescent suicide ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,720889,0.06510525589135115
"Smartphone-based digital phenotyping to detect high-risk affect states in body dysmorphic disorder Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is associated with extremely high risk for suicide attempts (22-28%) and substance use disorders (49%), underscoring the critical importance of risk detection in BDD. Negative affect states - particularly anxiety and shame - are well-documented risk factors for suicide and substance use in BDD, offering clear targets for risk detection and intervention. This K23 aims to develop and validate unobtrusive, time-sensitive, and ecologically valid measures of anxiety, shame, and general negative affect states in BDD, using smartphone-based digital phenotyping. Passive (i.e., unobtrusive) smartphone measurement of negative affect states will be based on GPS, accelerometer, and communication logs, used to detect behavioral features of anxiety (avoidance, rituals), shame (social withdrawal, isolation), and general negative affect (aggregated avoidance, rituals, withdrawal, and isolation features). We will collect passive and active (i.e., ecological momentary assessment [EMA]) smartphone data in 85 adults with BDD and will use EMA ratings of negative affect as outcomes, to build and validate predictive statistical models from passive data. We will also test the hypotheses that passive smartphone measures of negative affect states can significantly predict next-day suicidal ideation and substance use in BDD, above and beyond common clinical indices of risk. This project synthesizes the Candidate’s expertise in emotion-based risk for suicide in BDD with her experience conducting smartphone research. Building from this foundation, this K23 will provide critical new training in key areas to launch the Candidate’s independent research career: (1) digital phenotyping, including statistical learning and longitudinal analysis; (2) EMA methods; (3) assessment of suicide and substance use; (4) career development, including R01 writing; and (5) ethics of technology-based suicide and substance use research. Training goals will be accomplished with stellar mentorship and institutional support at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Sabine Wilhelm, a leader in BDD and clinical research, will serve as the primary mentor. Dr. Jukka-Pekka Onnela, an expert in digital phenotyping and its statistical approaches, and Dr. Michael Armey, an expert in EMA research of emotions and suicide, will serve as co-mentors. Complementary guidance in EMA and substance use will be provided by the advisory team: Drs. Bettina Hoeppner and A. Eden Evins. In line with NIMH Strategic Objective 2, this K23 will yield scalable, unobtrusive tools to detect acute, modifiable risk factors for suicide and substance use in a high-risk population. Moreover, negative affect states are transdiagnostic risk factors. As a next step to this proof-of- concept K23, the Candidate will apply for an R01 to further validate passive mobile detection of negative affect states and their ability to predict risk transdiagnostically. This program of research can enable (1) personalized just-in-time interventions targeting high-risk affect states, to reduce suicide and substance use; (2) unobtrusive monitoring of changes in risk; and (3) large-scale, ecologically-valid longitudinal research of risk processes. Project Narrative Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is associated with extremely high risk for suicide attempts (22-28%) and substance use disorders (49%), underscoring the importance of accurate, real-time risk detection in BDD. This study aims to use smartphone-based digital phenotyping to develop and validate unobtrusive, time-sensitive, and ecologically valid measures of key risk factors for suicide and substance misuse in BDD: negative affect states.

"Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) adolescents and adults, when compared to similar others, are at increased risk for suicide attempts and exposure to violence victimization. Suicide mortality is also elevated, especially among women, though research studies are sparse. Accordingly, NIH has formally designated sexual/gender minorities a health disparity population. Yet there remain large gaps in the scientific knowledge base that undermine development, dissemination and implementation of effective public health interventions to reduce risk in this vulnerable population. These include whether rates of homicide are similarly elevated among LGBT persons, whether suicide rates are elevated among the transgender population, what role gender and race/ethnicity play in shaping risk, as well as clarification of the contextual factors surrounding these deaths, including missed opportunities for intervention. The primary goal of the project is to identify patterns of risk and to characterize proximal factors associated with violent death due to suicide and homicide among LGBT individuals. Drawing from Minority Stress Theory and, for suicides, the `ideation-to-action' framework, we hypothesize that anti-gay stigma and discrimination creates a vulnerability for violent death among LGBT adolescents and adults. Capitalizing on new information classifying deaths for LGBT status in recent years of the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), we will make novel use of supervised machine learning techniques to recapture LGBT status among deaths in those 12 years and older in the 2003-2015 NVDRS (> 200,000 suicides, homicides, or homicide-suicides). Similar techniques will also be used to code NVDRS death narratives for co-occurring stigma-based contextual factors (e.g., gay disclosure, familial rejection), risk profiles (e.g. mental health, substance use), and recent services use in the immediate circumstances surrounding the death. This will allow us to achieve two study aims. For Aim 1, we will use NVDRS data and exogenous information estimating LGBT population size to generate state-level estimates of suicide and homicide rates, adjusted for population composition, among individuals 12 years and older. We hypothesize that LGBT population risk estimates for suicide and homicide will exceed those of non-LGBT populations. For Aim 2, we will identify sexual orientation and gender minority-linked differences in predisposing and proximal factors associated with suicide and homicide, including indicators of mental health and substance use, patterns of recent health care access, and characteristics of death circumstances, including HIV infection status. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we hypothesize that recent discrimination experiences will be strongly associated with sexual orientation and transgender status, that homicide deaths will more likely show evidence of hate-crime-related contextual factors, and that HIV-related issues will be an important though downward trending precipitant of suicide among sexual minority men. We also anticipate gender and ethnic/racial differences in these effects that will have important implications for future risk reducing interventions. Information obtained will greatly aid achieving the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Project 2025 goal of reducing the suicide rate 20% by 2025 and NIMH's Zero Suicide efforts by providing interventionists with data to design screening and intervention efforts for the LGBT population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project addresses an important public health problem—lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals likely experience higher rates of violent death, including suicide and possibly homicide, than other persons. Why this occurs has yet to be fully determined. This study investigates both predisposing and precipitating factors linked to violent death among LGBT individuals, age 12 years and older. Our goal is to identify modifiable, explanatory factors that can account for mortality disparities between LGBT and non-LGBT individuals.",Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable

"Predictive modeling: the role of opioid use in suicide risk PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Suicide deaths and opioid-related overdose deaths have both been increasing in recent years. These two public health crises have substantial overlap: our preliminary work suggests that between 22% and 37% of opioid-related overdoses are suicides or suicide attempts. Healthcare settings are ideal places to intervene to prevent suicides, however clinicians need better tools to recognize the patients at greatest risk. We developed models that predict risk of suicide attempt or death with 83% to 86% accuracy. However, these models do not include important opioid-related variables. In a parallel body of work, we developed algorithms based on coded electronic health record (EHR) data to identify opioid-related overdoses and classify them as unintentional or intentional suicides. The proposed project integrates these two existing lines of research. Our suicide risk prediction dataset includes seven large healthcare systems and approximately 20 million visits by 3 million patients; it is currently being expanded to include additional outcomes and visits through 2016, and additional predictors, however inclusion of opioid-related variables was not part of the funded supplement. In the proposed study, we will determine whether including variables related to illicit and prescribed opioid use, opioid use disorder, discontinuation or significant dose reductions of prescription opioids, or prior non-fatal opioid-related overdoses improves predictions of suicide attempts or death within 90 days following an outpatient healthcare visit. We will also develop models that specifically predict opioid- related suicide attempts and deaths in the sample as a whole and among people prescribed opioid medications, and determine if the predictors of opioid-related suicide attempts or deaths are consistent for men and women. The goal of the proposed work is to maximize the performance of our models in order to create the best available tools for clinicians to help reduce future suicides. We have an established collaboration with the largest national EHR vendor and are working to develop an EHR-based, point-of-care clinical tool to predict suicide attempts and deaths based on our research findings. This work will therefore have a direct impact on clinical practice by providing clinicians with an efficient, evidence-based tool to evaluate suicide risk.

"Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design Patients, clinicians, and policymakers often need valid information about the real-world effects of drugs and other exposures for which there have been pronounced time-trends in use. For example, the rapid growth in the use of rofecoxib in the early 2000s and of exogenous testosterone from 2000–2013 was accompanied by an urgent need for knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of those drugs. Randomized trials seldom enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or follow them long enough, to examine associations with rare outcomes. Therefore, non-randomized studies are needed, even though they are susceptible to unmeasured confounding and other forms of bias. To address these limitations of available epidemiologic designs, we recently introduced the trend-in-trend design: a novel, hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic research design that is applicable when there is a prominent trend in the use of the study exposure. Substantial additional development is needed to realize the full public health impact of the trend-in-trend research design. Areas in most need of development include: evaluation of a sequential analysis extension for real-time post-marketing safety surveillance; evaluation of machine learning to specify the trend-in-trend design’s underlying cumulative probability of exposure model; evaluation of dose-response relationships; and evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity based on baseline patient characteristics. For each of these methodologic needs, we propose an approach for which we will: 1) assess its statistical properties, in particular large-sample validity through asymptotics and finite sample statistical power; 2) evaluate its performance in thorough simulation studies; and 3) proof-test the approach using the known association between rofecoxib-acute myocardial infarction in healthcare data. Finally, we will apply these developments to the unresolved and highly important question of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men. This study will have broad scientific, clinical, and public health impact by greatly extending the utility of a novel epidemiologic research design with demonstrated validity and is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. It will also evaluate the safety of exogenous testosterone, a question of tremendous clinical and public health importance. Examining the safety of prescription drugs is one enormously important application of this design that has the potential to benefit many millions of people. As the trend-in-trend design is also applicable to non-drug exposures that have a pronounced time-trend (e.g., medical procedures, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, etc.), its potential impact on the population is even broader. This project will enhance the utility of the trend-in-trend research design, a novel hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic design that is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. Further, we will leverage these methods developments to study the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety of exogenous testosterone, unanswered questions of tremendous clinical and public health importance for older adult males.",Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design,9813026,R01AG064589,"['Adoption ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs ', ' non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drug ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Non Steroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' NSAIDs ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hybrids ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Pulmonary Embolism ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Safety ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Epidemiological Research Design ', ' Epidemiologic Research Design ', ' Testing ', ' Trans-Testosterone ', ' Therapeutic Testosterone ', ' Testosterone ', ' Thromboembolism ', ' Time ', ' Ventricular Arrhythmia ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Deep-Venous Thrombosis ', ' Deep Vein Thrombosis ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Venous ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' cyclooxygenase 2 ', ' prostaglandin H synthase-2 ', ' cyclo-oxygenase II ', ' Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase 2 ', ' Prostaglandin H2 Synthase 2 ', ' Prostaglandin G/H Synthase 2 ', ' PHS II ', ' PGHS2 ', ' PGH Synthase 2 ', ' Cyclo-Oxygenase-2 ', ' COX2 enzyme ', ' COX-2 protein ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Rofecoxib ', ' Vioxx ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Calendar ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' life-style factor ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' trend ', ' To specify ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' time use ', ' rapid growth ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' treatment effect ', ' non-drug ', ' nondrug ', ' population health ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' trend analysis ', ' Time trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,531144,0.08061291274527752
"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9774005,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol

"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9791316,R00ES027022,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cognition ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' environmental testing ', ' Ecological Monitoring ', ' Ecologic Monitoring ', ' Environmental Monitoring ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' New York City ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rotation ', ' Schools ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Urban Population ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' technical skills ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Distal ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' residence ', ' residential site ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Development Plans ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' experience ', ' pollutant ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' third grade ', ' 3rd grade ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ontology ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' epidemiological model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' early life exposure ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' health data ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Science ', ' urban children ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Child Health ', ' random forest ', ' ']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2019,246653,0.13313316656714494
"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. The proposed program will apply a novel dental biomarker of exposure to multiple chemicals and cutting-edge statistical methods to identify specific life stages including perinatal periods that correspond to increased susceptibility to neurodevelopmental effects of metal toxicant mixtures.",Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture,9767585,R01ES026033,"['Affect ', ' Arsenic ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mn element ', ' Manganese ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexico ', ' Organic Chemicals ', ' Phenotype ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' 2nd trimester ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Third Trimester ', ' Last Trimester ', ' 3rd trimester ', ' Third Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' Work ', ' Zn element ', ' Zinc ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Chemicals ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Dental ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' neurotoxicology ', ' early childhood ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Nutrient ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Toxicogenetics ', ' Toxicology Genetics ', ' Genetic Toxicology ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' cost ', ' Neurodevelopmental Deficit ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Metal exposure ', ' exposure to metal ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' toxic exposure ', ' 8 year old ', ' eight years of age ', ' eight year old ', ' age 8 years ', ' 8 years of age ', ' developmental neurotoxicity ', ' neurotoxic ', ' public health relevance ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' early life exposure ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' high dimensionality ', ' perinatal period ', ' perinatal phase ', ' ']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,608605,0.04971421529302652
"Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually. Despite ongoing efforts to reduce the burden of suicide and suicidal behavior, rates have remained relatively constant over the past half century. Attempts to predict suicidal behavior have relied almost exclusively on self-reporting of suicidal thoughts and intentions. This is problematic because of well-known reporting biases and the fact that many people at high risk are motivated to deny suicidal thoughts to avoid hospitalization. Even though the majority of all suicide decedents have contact with a healthcare professional in the month before their death, suicide risk is rarely detected in such cases. Efforts to identify risk factors have also been stymied by the fact that suicide is a low-base rate event so that very large samples are needed to test the complex combinations of factors that are likely to contribute to risk. The widespread adoption of longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) has created a powerful but still under-utilized resource for detecting and predicting important health outcomes. In prior work using machine learning methods to analyze structured EHR data, we have developed predictive models that detect up to 45% of first-episode suicidal behavior, on average 3 years in advance. Here we aim to systematically extend and improve our EHR prediction methods in a large healthcare system (N = 4.6 million patients) by incorporating 1) external public record datasets (LexisNexis SocioEconomic Health Attribute data) that include environmental, socioeconomic, and life event information; 2) natural language processing (NLP) to leverage unstructured EHR text, including text-based scores that capture RDoC domains; 3) a novel method of deriving temporal risk envelopes to capture the time-dependent effects of individual risk factors; and 4) clinical risk trajectories that incorporate ordered temporal sequences of risk factors. We will systematically compare the performance of each of these approaches to identify optimal strategies for enhancing risk surveillance and prediction in healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would represent a crucial step towards novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually, with 1.4 million attempting suicide annually. Unfortunately, efforts to identify those at high risk have had limited success. We have previously used machine learning methods to predict risk of suicidal behavior using the vast resources of data available in electronic health records. The proposed research will extend and improve this work by leveraging external datasets, medical record notes, and trajectories of risk over time to facilitate novel, clinically relevant, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior.",Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets,9762979,R01MH117599,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Calibration ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chronology ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Maps ', ' Markov Process ', ' Markov Chains ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Patients ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Legal ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Information Resources ', ' knowledge resources ', ' knowledge resource ', ' information resource ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Text ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' markov model ', ' process repeatability ', ' process reproducibility ', ' Outcome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' high risk ', ' electronic structure ', ' clinical risk ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' discrete time ', ' improved outcome ', ' data resource ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' risk prediction model ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,513970,0.10587873153326578
"Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and Sustainability of Trauma Center Provider Training in Suicide Safety Planning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 44,000 people died by suicide in the U.S. in 2016 and national rates continue to increase. The majority of people who died by suicide had contact with the health care system in the year prior to their death. Major hurdles to implementing suicide prevention in healthcare settings include the lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training routine healthcare providers in suicide prevention. Innovations in machine learning and artificial intelligence may overcome these hurdles as it is now possible for technology to assess the quality of provider skill in intervention delivery and provide opportunities for skill acquisition and practice. The candidate's long-term goal is to harness technological advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of training among general medical providers in suicide prevention. The proposed research and training activities will take place at the University of Washington at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, WA, a county safety-net hospital and level I trauma center serving patients across Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. The research aims to adapt and deploy existing scalable technology to train frontline trauma center providers (e.g., nurses) to collaboratively engage patients in a suicide safety planning intervention (SPI) and conduct a pilot feasibility trial of the resultant training. Aim 1 includes focus groups with trauma nurses to identify individual, setting, and organizational-level implementation barriers and facilitators based on the Theoretical Domains Framework and inform strategies for engaging nurses in training and delivery of the SPI with patients. Aim 1 also includes the user-centered design method of contextual inquiry, including task analysis, with nurses to inform workflow- integration. Aim 2 includes user-centered design methods to identify technology refinements and adaptations based on nurse preferences to increase usability. The technologies are a 1) conversational agent, with simulated patient role-play and real-time feedback, and 2) AI-based feedback of counseling performance from SPI audio recordings. Aim 3 is to conduct a pilot randomized trial of a technology-enhanced provider training as compared to a web-based didactic only condition. The longitudinal trial will include 20 nurses (10 per condition), each with 3 patients, and support submission of an NIMH R01 full-scale trial. The K23 training goals include building knowledge and skills in 1) technology-focused team science, 2) the application and integration of implementation science, user-centered design, and adult learning theory for technology adaptation and integration for nurse training, 3) acute care suicide prevention clinical trials research, including the responsible conduct of research with patients at-risk for suicide, and statistical methods for low base-rate outcomes and nested longitudinal clinical trials data. This K23 application addresses the NIMH Strategic Plan by developing strategies incorporating information technology and pragmatic feedback systems for suicide prevention efforts in real-world practice, reaching the full breadth of patients presenting to the health care system after injury. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year in the United States approximately 30 million individuals require emergency department visits; 1.5- 2.5 million are so severely injured that they require inpatient hospitalization and over 650,000 patients present for self-inflicted injury. Acute care medical settings, such as emergency departments and inpatient trauma units, present critical opportunities for suicide prevention, which is stymied by a lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training providers in high quality suicide prevention interventions. The proposed K23 harnesses advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of suicide prevention training among acute medical care providers to better reach the population of patients at-risk for suicide with potentially life-saving interventions.",Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and Sustainability of Trauma Center Provider Training in Suicide Safety Planning,9821134,K23MH118361,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Alaska ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computers ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Empathy ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Services ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Idaho ', ' Inpatients ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Methods ', ' Montana ', ' Motivation ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Partnership Practice ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' Savings ', ' Science ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' trauma centers ', ' trauma units ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Wyoming ', ' County ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' prevent suicide ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' Acute ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Asses ', ' Equus asinus ', ' Donkey ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' preference ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' technological innovation ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Enhancement Technology ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Trauma Nursing ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' injured ', ' computerized ', ' Information Technology ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' safety net ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' Health behavior change ', ' suicidal patient ', ' suicide patient ', ' task analysis ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' implementation science ', ' prevention clinical trial ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' trauma care ', ' screening ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Trauma patient ', ' recruit ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' implementation strategy ', ' feasibility trial ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2019,154695,0.1029445540880802
"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy. We will define the bigger-picture cellular networks and gene-environment interactions driving PSC by integrating multiple layers of -omics data. In so doing, we will identify molecular disease signatures, including environmental toxins, metabolism-related chemicals and gut bacteria, unique to PSC patients.",Dissecting the pathogenesis and

"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",9749156,R01ES027747,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Animals ', ' Arsenic ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Carbon ', ' Carbon Black ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cognition ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mn element ', ' Manganese ', ' Hg element ', ' Mercury ', ' Metals ', ' NO3- ', ' Nitrates ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Suggestion ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Trace Mineral ', ' Biometals ', ' Trace Elements ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Vesicle ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' cognitive function ', ' Pollution ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Particulate ', ' Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates ', ' sulfate ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Visit ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' cohort ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' Early identification ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' RNA marker ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Public Health Applications Research ', ' Public Health Applications ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' toxic metal ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Impairment ', ' modifiable risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' extracellular vesicles ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' ']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2019,708647,0.0384963578669223
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,9765987,R01ES030302,"['Accounting ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arsenic ', ' Atlases ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood -

"Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram Abstract The current project proposes an innovative professional development (PD) program in environmental health research experiences for science high-school teachers from schools with high poverty levels in North Carolina. In a collaborative effort, experts from the College of Education and scientists affiliated with the Center for Human Health and Environment (CHHE), and the Comparative Medicine Institute (CMI) at NC State University will provide teachers (N=40) with unique authentic lab experiences. The 8-week summer research PD program aims at enhancing teachers' environmental health literacy and research skills that will support novel science teaching strategies. The specific aims addressed by the program are the following: 1) to provide teachers with a practical understanding of the scientific method in mentored research projects examining links between environmental stressors and health; 2) to provide teachers with an understanding of core conceptual issues in toxicology; 3) to train teachers in ethical issues in scientific conduct, science communication, and public health; 4) to immerse teachers in authentic research lab experiences by using a cognitive apprenticeship model; and 5) to develop a comprehensive evaluation plan in order to assess the short- and long- term PD outcomes. In the proposed environmental health science (EHS) research PD program, teachers will be integrated into genuine research projects and attend lab meetings, gaining general knowledge of how research is conducted and specialized knowledge related to ongoing projects in their host lab. Additionally, teachers in the program will come together one day per week in a workshop environment, to share their diversity of research experiences and gain additional training in biological concepts and ethical issues related to environmental health sciences. Project Narrative Environmental health research experiences are often inaccessible to high-school teachers, particularly in high-poverty schools. Our PD program will provide teachers with scientific knowledge and resources to improve their classroom instruction by adopting a curriculum grounded in environmental health research. Further, teachers' newly acquired EHS knowledge and research skills have the potential to improve student science learning, and promote interest and readiness for STEM careers. By exposing students to novel instructional strategies, students will acquire not just STEM specialized knowledge, but develop STEM domain identification. This is particularly important for science, given the fact that students from high- poverty schools are economically disadvantaged and may comprise a large proportion of individuals from minority groups that are underrepresented in science.",Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram,9605786,R25ES028974,"['Biomedical Research ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Educational Activities ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' North Carolina ', ' Poverty ', ' Poverty Areas ', ' Program Development ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Public Health ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' School Teachers ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' teaching methodology ', ' instructional strategy ', ' instructional practice ', ' Teaching Method ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxicology ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' health science research ', ' stressor ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' health literacy ', ' Instruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' comparative ', ' STEM career ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics career ', ' science, technology, engineering and math workforce ', ' science, technology, engineering and math career ', ' STEM workforce ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' teacher development ', ' instructor training ', ' faculty professional development ', ' faculty development ', ' Teacher Training ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Faculty Education ', ' K-12 Faculty ', ' K-12 educator ', ' K-12 Teachers ', ' High School Faculty ', ' Secondary Teacher ', ' Secondary School Faculty ', ' High School Teacher ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' apprenticeship ', ' apprentice ', ' pedagogical content ', ' pedagogical method ', ' pedagogical development ', ' pedagogical approach ', ' laboratory experience ', ' laboratory training ', ' lab experience ', ' summer research ', ' science teacher ', ' science professional ', ' science educator ', ' high school program ', ' exposure route ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIEHS,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R25,2019,99506,0.07816030159188687
"Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures: Administrative Supplement for U3 Populations Project Summary/Abstract of the PRIME parent award: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are major causes of perinatal mortality and morbidity and have profound consequences for maternal and child health, but it is unclear if and how rates of HDP are changing over time, or whether neighborhood conditions (e.g., racial residential segregation) and air pollution exposure are associated with risk of developing HDP. We use detailed birth records and Bayesian spatial analysis methods to better understand how HDP rates have changed over a 20 year period (1995-2014), whether racial/ethnic disparities in HDP rates have narrowed or widened in this time frame, and if neighborhood racial segregation and air pollution exposure are associated with an individual’s HDP risk.",Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures: Administrative Supplement for U3 Populations,9911827,R01ES028819,"['Maternal and Child Health ', ' Process ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' lead exposure ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Science ', ' perinatal morbidity ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' data resource ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Award ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Birth Records ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Geography ', ' Housing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' North Carolina ', ' Parents ', ' perinatal deaths ', ' Perinatal lethality ', ' Perinatal Mortalities ', ' Perinatal mortality demographics ', ' Poverty ', ' Pregnancy Rate ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Time ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' Work ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' pregnancy disorder ', ' Link ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pollution ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' pollutant ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' social stress ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' ']",NIEHS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,117375,0.09025002722148241
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide Project Summary  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents. In addition to deaths, 16% of adolescents report seriously considering suicide each year, and 8% make one or more attempts. Despite these alarming statistics, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. Thus, developing effective methods to improve short-term prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is critical.  Currently, our most robust predictors of STBs are demographic or clinical indicators that have relatively weak predictive value. However, there is an emerging literature on short-term prediction of suicide risk that has identified a number of promising candidates, including rapid escalation of: (a) emotional distress, (b) social dysfunction (i.e., bullying, rejection), and (c) sleep disturbance. Yet, prior studies are limited in two critical ways. First, they rely almost entirely on self-report. Second, most studies have not focused on assessment of these risk factors using intensive longitudinal assessment techniques that are able to capture the dynamics of changes in risk states. These are fundamental limitations. While suicidal ideation may precede an attempt by years, socio-emotional changes preceding a suicide attempt often occurs within the time span of minutes to hours. This study will capitalize on recent developments in real-time monitoring methods that harness adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology. Specifically, we now have the capacity to use: (a) smartphone technology to conduct intensive longitudinal assessments monitoring putative risk factors with minimal participant burden and (b) modern computational techniques to develop predictive algorithms for STBs.  The project will include high-risk adolescents (n = 200) aged 13-18 years recruited from outpatient and inpatient clinics: (a) recent suicide attempters with current ideation (n = 70), (b) current suicide ideators with no attempt history (n = 70), and (c) a psychiatric control group with no STB history (n = 60). Effortless Assessment of Risk States (EARS) will be used to continuously measure variables relevant to key risk domains—emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—through passive monitoring of participants' smartphone use. First, we will test between-group differences in risk factors during an initial 2-week period, and determine the extent to which risk factors derived from mobile phones improves discrimination over self-reported indicators. Second, we will use statistical techniques to test whether the risk factors improve short-term prediction of STBs (e.g., suicide attempts, hospitalization) during the 6-month follow-up period above and beyond clinical assessments. Third, computational machine learning techniques—based on a priori and learned features—will develop predictive models that utilize the full range of intensive longitudinal data collected by the active and passive monitoring methods to predict group membership and STB outcomes. Ultimately, by leveraging smartphone technology, we aim to improve the short-term STB prediction and provide clinicians and patients with reliable, scalable and actionable tools that will reduce the needless loss of life. Project Narrative Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and despite this pressing public health crisis, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. However, recent advancements in mobile technologies afford the capacity to monitor known risk factors—including emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—which has the potential to revolutionize our insight and clinical management of short- term risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, the present study will leverage adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology, along with advanced signal processing and computational modeling approaches, to identify promising short-term predictors of suicide among high-risk adolescents, which ultimately, may reduce needless loss of life.",MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide,9773224,U01MH116923,"['Academic

"Environment, Metabolomics, and PD Project Abstract Our PEG study is among the largest Parkinson's disease (PD) population-based study with exceptional high-quality disease characterization and in-depth exposure assessment. Patients are diagnosed and examined (multiple times) by a UCLA movement disorder specialist. We developed a longitudinal geographic information system (GIS) based assessment for pesticide exposures that links state-mandated information on type, date, and location of all agricultural pesticide applications in California recorded since 1974 to land use maps and study participants' residences and work places. Here we propose to combine a powerful new metabolomics tool and system biology analytic methods to identify signatures for toxic exposures that evoke long-term biologic responses. The metabolomics data we will generate will help us identify metabolic profiles for chronic environmental exposures for both PD patients and population controls. This will generate a first understanding of the metabolic consequences of chronic low dose pesticide exposure in PD. However, biologic processes, including biologic responses to chronic toxicant exposures and those involved in disease development, are highly dynamic and interactive systems. The PEG study is uniquely capable to begin investigating these multidimensional networks linking exposure and disease. We have already generated genome and epigenome profiles for 550 PD patients and 250 controls. Here we newly propose to generate and analyze serum based metabolome profiles (targeted and untargeted) for these same 800 study participants characterizing environmental pesticide exposures via metabolome wide association analyses. We aim to develop a metabolite signature of environmental exposure using supervised machine learning methods, and also determine if these are disease specific or found in both exposed cases and controls. Furthermore, incorporating our genome and epigenome information, we propose to use biological systems analysis to identify multi-omics network patterns that distinguish environmental exposures that contribute to PD onset and progression. We expect this to show a chronic response pattern across different molecular layers and are influenced by many environmental factors. Combining multi-omic measures based on multidimensional network and system analyses will address the gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD. Project Narrative Here we propose to build upon a unique resource - the PEG population-based Parkinson's disease (PD) study - to identify metabolic signatures of chronic environmental exposures and disease in 550 PD patients and 250 population controls. Importantly, we plan to integrate exposure and effect markers across multiple molecular layers (genome, epigenome, metabolome), with the goal to obtain a more holistic understanding of molecular changes due to chronic environmental exposures. Our approach incorporates multi-omics measures and multidimensional network and system analyses to address gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD.","Environment, Metabolomics, and PD",9652630,R21ES030175,"['Address ', ' Dose ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' metabolomics ', '

"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of

"Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data PROJECT ABSTRACT Suicide is one of the leading causes of death. As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. While white males between 45 and 64 years of age are 4 times more likely than females to die by suicide, females attempt suicide 3 times as often as males. Recent data suggest that there are 20 times as many suicide attempts, which is generally considered a high and consistent risk factor for subsequent suicide. However, predicting and monitoring when someone will attempt self-harm and suicide has been nearly impossible. In this project, we plan to leverage large-scale, integrated electronic health record and claims from the New York City Clinical Data Research Network to study the suicidality in relation to emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations. In particular, using data on >10 million patients, we will develop novel NLP and machine learning models to identify patients at highest risk for self-harm, suicide attempt and suicide, and conduct a pilot study to assess the clinical utility of such models. We will also conduct a validation study using similar data from Kaiser Permanente Washington. PROJECT NARRATIVE As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. Successful identification of patients who are at the risk of self-harm, suicide attempt, and suicide can lead potential clinical interventions for improving patient outcomes. This proposal will apply “big data” techniques to identify patients at risk of suicidal behavior using large-scale integrated clinical data.","Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data",9714930,R01MH119177,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death Certificates ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discharge Plannings ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Female ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Judgment ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' male ', ' Medicine ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Time ', ' Washington ', ' Gender ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Presbyterian Church ', ' Presbyterians ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Services ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' suicidal risk ', ' suicide risk ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' validation studies ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' model design ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' data integration ', ' Population ', ' suicidal patient ', ' suicide patient ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' data registry ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' ER patient ', ' ED patient ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' insurance claims ', ' clinical decision support ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' risk prediction model ', ' ']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,779940,0.1559583944146925
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior Abstract/Project Summary  The suicide rate among young adults aged 18-25 has risen to the highest level in more than 30 years, yet our ability to accurately predict suicide attempts remains limited to distal, static risk factors. There is an urgent need for research to identify ways to assess who is most at risk for suicide in the near future, consistent with Aspirational Goal 3 of the National Action Alliance’s Prioritized Research Agenda. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this R01 from an Early Stage Investigator is to improve our ability to identify specific near-term, dynamic within-person processes that predict acute increases in a vulnerable individual’s risk for suicide. Social processes related to affiliation and attachment (e.g., social rejection or exclusion), as well as painful and provocative events (PPE; e.g., violent trauma and self-injury), are well-known distal risk factors for suicide. However, the role of dynamic cognitive-affective and biological responses to experiences of rejection for predicting near-term suicide risk in any individual is poorly understood. In addition, it is not known how the influence of rejection-related processes on near-term suicide risk may vary as a function of distal risk factors such as exposure to PPE. The current application outlines a multimethod intensive longitudinal study to examine dynamic affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term risk factors for temporal fluctuations in suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) over the course of hours to days, weeks, and months. We will also examine exposure to PPE as a moderator that amplifies intraindividual reactivity to social rejection, thereby further increasing suicide risk. Participants will include a diagnostically diverse clinical sample of 150 young adult men and women (ages 18 to 35) with clinically significant STB in the past 4 months. Multimodal assessments at baseline will include a 21-day random and event-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol; laboratory paradigms with psychophysiological measures, self-reports, and assessment of implicit suicide-related cognition; and interviews using timeline follow-back (TLFB) methods. Assessments at 4-month intervals over the course of 12 months will include repeated laboratory tasks, physiological and implicit assessments, self-reports, and TLFB interviews to assess changes in responses to rejection, PPE, and STB over time. The proposed project has three specific aims: (1) Examine multimodal measures of within- individual affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term, prospective predictors of within- person fluctuations in STB over time; (2) Examine exposure to PPE as between-persons distal moderators of within-person processes leading to near-term increases in STB at the individual level; and (3) Apply machine learning techniques to identify combinations of multiple time-varying within-person processes and static between-person differences that are most predictive of suicide risk over time. Results of this study will lead to advances in suicide risk assessment, identification of novel points of intervention, and development of personalized interventions to prevent suicide attempts among vulnerable individuals. Project Narrative Suicide is a serious public health problem that ranks as the second leading cause of death in adults under age 35. This research will contribute to our ability to better predict suicidal behavior in the near term, having direct implications for suicide risk assessment, risk stratification, and personalized intervention approaches aimed at reducing and preventing suicide.",Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior,9844975,R01MH115922,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arousal ', ' Sinus Arrhythmia ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cognition ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' TimeLine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Distal ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicidal ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' respiratory ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Exclusion ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' physical abuse ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' Affective ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' person centered ', ' high risk ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' reduce suicidality ', ' reduce suicide ', ' reducing suicidality ', ' reducing suicide ', ' clinical predictors ', ' Social Processes ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized intervention ', ' marginalization ', ' social exclusion ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Self-Direction ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' Risk stratification ', ' recruit ', ' individualized response ', ' individual response ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,702056,0.13802036093444606
"Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) PROJECT SUMMARY Evidence suggests that exposure to Superfund chemicals contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), including preterm birth (PTB). Rates of PTB and infant mortality in Puerto Rico (PR) are among the highest of all US states and territories. There are 18 Superfund sites in PR, and evidence of contamination of the drinking water is extensive. Moreover, extreme weather events (hurricanes, flooding) may result in elevated exposures to Superfund chemicals. The PROTECT center has brought together researchers from Northeastern University, the University of Puerto Rico, University of Georgia, and the University of Michigan to provide much needed understanding of the relationship and the mechanisms by which exposure to suspect chemicals contribute to APOs, and to develop new methods to reduce risk of exposure in PR and beyond. To do this, PROTECT uses a source-to-outcome structure, integrating epidemiological (Project 1), toxicological (Project 2), fate and transport (Project 3), and remediation (Project 4) studies, a unified sampling infrastructure, a centralized indexed data repository, and a sophisticated data management system. Since its inception in 2010, PROTECT has built detailed and extensive data sets on environmental conditions and prenatal conditions of 1457 pregnant mothers (exposure, socioeconomic and health data–close to 3000 data points per participant), yielding a cohort of 1210 live births in northern PR. In the renewal, PROTECT will recruit and follow an additional 1000 study participants, yielding a cohort of 800+ live births for an ultimate total cohort of 2000+ completed live births. PROTECT has documented significant contamination of northern PR drinking water and has found compelling preliminary epidemiologic and mechanistic toxicology associations between Superfund chemicals and APOs. PROTECT research has focused on chlorinated volatile organic compounds and phthalates and their role in PTB. The PROTECT renewal will broaden its scope, employing a data-driven approach to study and reduce the impact of exposure to mixtures of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites in karst regions on APOs in Puerto Rico’s underserved, highly-exposed population. Target chemicals will be expanded to include metals, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We will investigate the impacts of extreme weather events on contaminant transport and exposure, and new water treatment technologies will be developed for portable and robust water treatment systems. The PROTECT renewal will also focus on oxidative stress as an underlying biological pathway by which contaminant exposure can lead to APOs. New statistical methods and data mining, machine learning, and visualization tools will be developed to allow PROTECT researchers to analyze our datasets. PROTECT will employ innovative approaches to engage and educate the community, involve study participants, report- back data, and communicate with stakeholders. A broad suite of training and professional activities will be provided to trainees, individually tailored to the trainees’ needs and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Reproductive health has been at the forefront of Puerto Ricans’ health concerns as rates of preterm birth and infant mortality in Puerto Rico are among the highest of all U.S. states and territories. The PROTECT SRC is exploring the link between exposure to a mixture of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites and adverse pregnancy outcomes in Puerto Rico, and is working to reduce that exposure. Improved understanding of the link between adverse pregnancy outcomes and contamination, together with developing sustainable technologies to reduce risk, will help improve health outcomes in Puerto Rico (a disadvantaged population) and beyond.",Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT),9839906,P42ES017198,"['Awareness ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' environmental contamination ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Floods ', ' Flooding ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hurricane ', ' indexing ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Pesticides ', ' Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons ', ' polyaromatic hydrocarbons ', ' polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' sound ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' tissue culture ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' Universities ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Mediating ', ' phthalates ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Premature Birth ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Policies ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Water Purification ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Exposure to ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Live Birth ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' groundwater ', ' ground water ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' water treatment ', ' contaminant transport ', ' drinking water ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' Structure ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' superfund chemical ', ' superfund site ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' in vitro Model ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Oxidative Stress Induced Gene Expression Via Nrf2 ', ' Oxidative Stress Pathway ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' remediation ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' volatile organic chemical ', ' volatile organic compound ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Superfund ', ' health data ', ' data visualization ', ' Water contamination ', ' contaminated water ', ' drinking water contamination ', ' contaminated drinking water ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' recruit ', ' model of human ', ' human model ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data repository ', ' data warehouse ', ' Infrastructure ', ' high dimensional data ', ' multidimensional datasets ', ' multidimensional data ', ' community involvement ', ' Data Management System ', ' Data Management Resources ', ' extreme weather ', ' ']",NIEHS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,P42,2020,2414074,0.015235849316156812
"Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater Project Summary / Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a naturally-occurring metal contaminant found in water supplies throughout the world. Although research using small samples (< 400 observations) from Bangladesh, China and Canada suggests that excessive consumption of Mn is neurotoxic in infants and young children, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) classifies Mn only as a secondary contaminant. Thus, Mn is not subject to mandatory monitoring in public water systems, let alone private wells, which serve over 2 million Californians while remaining unregulated and untreated. To reconcile the gap between epidemiological evidence and regulatory action, we propose this timely research. Our project, which takes California’s private wells as a focal point for its investigation, has three specific aims: to identify (1) areas at high risk of exposure to Mn in drinking water (2) the socioeconomic characteristics of communities at high-risk of Mn exposure, and (3) the degree of association between Mn exposure and the health outcomes of infants and young children. While treatment for Mn-contaminated water is technologically straightforward, access may depend on a community’s socioeconomic and political status; thus, there is danger of Mn silently amplifying health inequalities. The ​broader, long-term objectives of this research are (I) to encourage further analyses of Mn exposure in California by developing a statewide publicly-available dataset from groundwater Mn data, and (II) to develop a ​causal ​framework for a primary-sample study of Mn effects on infant and child health. California enforces the US EPA’s secondary contaminant standard of 50 µg L​-1 but only in community water systems. Non-transient, non-community water systems (e.g. schools and hospitals) and private wells are exempt. In recent years, the US Geological Survey (USGS) has found Mn concentrations above the health-based target of 300 µg L​-1 in California’s wells. ​The proposed research will indicate whether and to what extent Mn affects child health and contributes to health disparities. As such, it is aligned with the NIEHS mission to determine how environmental exposures affect humans in order to promote healthier lives. To achieve the first aim of identifying areas at high risk of exposure to unsafe concentrations of Mn, we will use a machine learning model on subsurface flow and groundwater chemistry to predict Mn concentrations in the Central Valley, Los Angeles, Central Coast and West Coast Basins; then, we will overlay the Mn prediction grid with ZIP code and school district polygons to identify the areas that emerge with more than a 50% chance of exposure to Mn at the secondary standard as high-risk. For the second aim, we will determine if high-risk areas are distinguished from low-risk areas by their socioeconomic status and demographics using two-sample t-tests. For the third aim, we will run least squares regressions of birth weight, grade-by-school test scores and chronic absenteeism rates on predicted Mn exposure with controls for chemical confounds, socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics. Project Narrative The impact of manganese (Mn) on population health is an under-investigated problem in the United States relative to the wide prevalence and frequent detections of the chemical above safe concentrations in groundwater basins throughout the country. In line with NIEHS priorities to better understand environmental health disparities and to aid in securing environmental justice, we propose to correct this knowledge gap by undertaking a substantial investigation into the prevalence of Mn in California’s private wells, and examining the shared characteristics of communities most likely to be exposed to unsafe levels of manganese in drinking water. By also performing a preliminary investigation of the relationship between Mn exposure and child cognitive health, our study will provide an initial assessment of the public health threat from Mn, highlight the most vulnerable communities, and inform regulatory agencies seeking to review drinking water standards for Mn.",Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater,9978510,R21ES030807,"['Absenteeism ', ' Affect ', ' Asia ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Birth Weight ', ' California ', ' Canada ', ' Chemistry ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' China ', ' Mainland China ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Esthetics ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birth weight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birthweight ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Maps ', ' Metals ', ' Mission ', ' Oxygen ', ' O element ', ' O2 element ', ' Politics ', ' Poverty ', ' Privatization ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Schools ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water Supply ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Infant Health ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Micronutrients ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' grade school ', ' elementary school ', ' groundwater ', ' ground water ', ' drinking water ', ' novel ', ' Impaired health ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Consumption ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' neurotoxic ', ' infant outcome ', ' human exposure ', ' exposed human population ', ' demographics ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' high risk ', ' health inequalities ', ' environmental justice ', ' population health ', ' Secure ', ' Geology Survey ', ' geological applications ', ' geological characterization ', ' geology characterization ', ' Geological Survey ', ' school district ', ' Water contamination ', ' contaminated water ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Child Health ', ' econometrics ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,R21,2020,224680,0.1208338474013344
"Predictive modeling: the role of opioid use in suicide risk PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Suicide deaths and opioid-related overdose deaths have both been increasing in recent years. These two public health crises have substantial overlap: our preliminary work suggests that between 22% and 37% of opioid-related overdoses are suicides or suicide attempts. Healthcare settings are ideal places to intervene to prevent suicides, however clinicians need better tools to recognize the patients at greatest risk. We developed models that predict risk of suicide attempt or death with 83% to 86% accuracy. However, these models do not include important opioid-related variables. In a parallel body of work, we developed algorithms based on coded electronic health record (EHR) data to identify opioid-related overdoses and classify them as unintentional or intentional suicides. The proposed project integrates these two existing lines of research. Our suicide risk prediction dataset includes seven large healthcare systems and approximately 20 million visits by 3 million patients; it is currently being expanded to include additional outcomes and visits through 2016, and additional predictors, however inclusion of opioid-related variables was not part of the funded supplement. In the proposed study, we will determine whether including variables related to illicit and prescribed opioid use, opioid use disorder, discontinuation or significant dose reductions of prescription opioids, or prior non-fatal opioid-related overdoses improves predictions of suicide attempts or death within 90 days following an outpatient healthcare visit. We will also develop models that specifically predict opioid- related suicide attempts and deaths in the sample as a whole and among people prescribed opioid medications, and determine if the predictors of opioid-related suicide attempts or deaths are consistent for men and women. The goal of the proposed work is to maximize the performance of our models in order to create the best available tools for clinicians to help reduce future suicides. We have an established collaboration with the largest national EHR vendor and are working to develop an EHR-based, point-of-care clinical tool to predict suicide attempts and deaths based on our research findings. This work will therefore have a direct impact on clinical practice by providing clinicians with an efficient, evidence-based tool to evaluate suicide risk. The work will also provide critical data on understudied opioid-related predictors and moderators of suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicides and opioid-related overdoses have many overlapping risk factors, and both have been increasing over the past decade, causing concern that many overdose deaths may actually be suicides. We developed robust models to predict suicide attempts and deaths following outpatient healthcare visits. We also developed algorithms to identify opioid-related overdoses and classify them as unintentional or intentional suicides.

"Using claims data to study the association between Alzheimer's disease and suicidal behaviors PROJECT ABSTRACT Given that dementia represents the major cause of loss of autonomy in older adults, a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and its related dementias (ADRD) could represent a critical moment that increases the risk of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA). However, despite significant research progress in the past decade, it remains unclear if there are “clusters” of patients with ADRD who are at an increased risk for suicide, and how utilization of healthcare services, or the lack thereof, might be associated with SI/SA rates. This supplement will use large-scale commercial health insurance claims data and advanced machine learning algorithms to study these questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day.

"Innovations in Suicide Prevention Research (INSPIRE) ABSTRACT  Despite intensive prevention efforts from federal and state agencies, suicide is now the 10th leading cause of mortality overall in the US, increasing steadily over the past two decades and claiming more than 47,000 lives in 2017. The impact of suicide is particularly high among vulnerable populations such as adolescents and formerly incarcerated individuals. Suicide attempts also exact a high emotional, physical, and economic toll.  Although much research has focused on causes and predictors of death from suicide, progress in suicide prevention has been hampered by data linkage and methodological challenges. While national mortality rates are known, entities with the potential to implement large suicide prevention initiatives – health systems, insurers, and departments of corrections – lack the linked data to monitor suicide incidence in their populations, establish benchmarks, and establish an evaluation framework for prevention efforts. Many individuals who die from suicide have had recent contact with a health care, health insurance, or correctional system, representing critical missed opportunities to implement suicide prevention measures.  Two key needs are highlighted by the present RFA: linked surveillance systems that integrate healthcare, insurer (private and public), and correctional data with mortality outcomes to provide a framework for implementing and evaluating suicide prevention initiatives, and large and adequately powered datasets with rich health care access information over an extended period, matched with rigorous study designs for observational data. Therefore, our objective in the current proposal is to establish an in-depth suicide surveillance system linking multiple large, comprehensive databases and use that system to define suicide mortality benchmarks, identify predictors of suicide risk, generate risk prediction tools, evaluate suicide prevention efforts, and establish long-term workflow protocols to sustain the surveillance system. Our team is uniquely positioned to address these needs through our deep expertise in suicide, mental health, and health care utilization research; our extensive experience in application of rigorous epidemiological methods to large linked databases; our established access to comprehensive, regularly updated databases representing health care encounters, public and private insurance claims, corrections data, and suicide deaths in one of the most populous states in the US; and our successful work in prior projects to link all of these databases at the individual level using all appropriate safeguards and security measures.  This project will be the first to link these large state- and healthcare system-level databases to establish an ongoing suicide surveillance system to identify short and long term predictors of suicide and to inform and evaluate suicide prevention efforts in North Carolina and across the United States. We anticipate such suicide prevention efforts will get embedded in healthcare systems where at-risk individuals can be identified and referred for prevention and care, thereby preventing suicides and reducing their societal impacts. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will define suicide mortality rates for four key target populations of patients either engaged in health care, privately or publicly insured, or recently released from prison; will define clinical predictors of suicide mortality risk; will evaluate the impact of a health care system-delivered routine suicidal risk assessment protocol on suicide mortality risk; and will lay the groundwork for the ongoing continuation of the suicide mortality surveillance system.",Innovations in Suicide Prevention Research (INSPIRE),10104283,R01MH124752,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Death Records ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' North Carolina ', ' Patients ', ' Prisons ', ' Privatization ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk ', ' Security Measures ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' suicidal mortality ', ' suicide mortality rate ', ' suicide mortality ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' correctional system ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' prevention evaluation ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' years of life lost ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' clinical predictors ', ' study population ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' insurance claims ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,769521,0.14030209908440208
"Developing Suicide Risk Algorithms for Diverse Clinical Settings using Data Fusion Suicide is one of the most serious public health problems facing the United States. Recent evidence indicates that many if not most of individuals who die by suicide have been in contact with the healthcare system in the months prior to their death, providing data that can be used to identify patients at risk prior to an attempt. The proposed project will develop an innovative method for identifying patients at risk of suicidal behavior using data from a large multistate health information exchange, integrated with data from the State of Connecticut’s CHIME hospital database. We will develop and test suicide risk algorithms using principles associated with transfer learning, in which information from a comprehensive external data source is used to improve prediction in a more limited dataset. Specifically, we will use multimodal data fusion techniques to develop and test algorithms that can identify patients at risk of suicidal behavior by clinicians in hospitals with limited numbers of patients, select patient populations, and lack of access to outpatient data. This approach is not only generalizable to hospitals throughout the US but can be extended to very diverse clinical settings, e.g., primary and specialty care practices, community health centers, urgent care clinics. The potential public health significance of this study is substantial. The fragmentation of the healthcare system, particularly in relation to patients’ behavioral health needs, highlights the critical need to cultivate comprehensive, system-wide approaches to identifying and managing at patients at risk of suicide.

"Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status Abstract Exposures to extreme events are increasingly common in many parts of the globe as a function of changes in weather patterns combined with rising sea levels, but there is a paucity of data to support scientific research on the implications of such exposures for population health and well-being over the long-term. STAR, the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, is a unique exception. We have interviewed respondents from 10 months before the December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami for 10 years. This project will follow up the same respondents 15 years after the tsunami. The pre-tsunami baseline is a population-representative survey of 27,000 individuals who were living along the coast of Aceh and North Sumatra, Indonesia. The tsunami constitutes a large-scale, unanticipated natural disaster in an area that was not thought to be prone to tsunamis. Moreover, its impacts were spatially idiosyncratic across the study area. Whether a particular community was inundated by the waves depended on a combination of the wave direction, seabed and shoreline topography. Of 368 baseline communities, about a fifth were devastated, a third were somewhat damaged and the rest were not directly affected. These features of the natural experiment provide the basis for identifying causal impacts of this major natural disaster which killed 170,000 people in the study area. The baseline and six post-tsunami waves collected during the prior phase of this project provide detailed information about exposure to and experience of the disaster and the evolution of health and wellbeing, broadly defined, for baseline respondents who survived the tsunami plus new household members. In each follow-up, we have interviewed 95% of all baseline survivors. In this continuation we will re-interview all baseline survivors and their household members fifteen years after the tsunami. We will place these data in the public domain, adding to prior waves of STAR already in the public domain to create an unparalleled data resource for the scientific community. Focusing on those who were exposed to the tsunami as children (age <12y and in utero at the time), we will investigate the impacts of tsunami exposure on the evolution of health, education and cognitive performance, linking outcomes to changes in material and psycho-social resources at the family level as well as community level resources. The latter will be measured combining administrative data and information extracted from satellite imagery using machine learning. Longer-term impacts, fifteen years after the tsunami, will exploit innovative human capital measures including biomarkers, executive function and emotional reactivity. Loss of one or both parents is among the most extreme exposures. We will explore the causal effects of orphanhood by comparing children who lost parents in the tsunami with those in the same community who did not. Project Narrative This project will field the fifteen year follow up of the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery (STAR), a large-scale longitudinal study of individuals differentially exposed to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.

"Cardiovascular health and exposure to PM2.5 constituents: a multi-cohort study Project Summary Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the primary cause of death and a major cause of years of life lost in the US and in the world. Cohort studies conducted in North America and Europe have provided crucial information in identifying exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as a cause of increased CVD risks. They have also pointed out important directions for future research, including the differential toxicity of PM2.5 chemical constituents to CVD incidence, the shape of concentration-response (C-R) functions, impact of exposure time windows and indoor air pollution exposure. The objectives of our study are to assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and incident CVD, and investigate the impact of exposure time window and indoor air pollution on these associations. Approach. We will conduct a retrospective multi-cohort study in China using personal health records from five national cohorts with adjudicated CVD endpoints maintained by the Fuwai Hospital. To provide individual-level exposure trajectories for ~120,000 cohort participants during their follow-up period, we will develop an ensemble machine learning model using ground air quality measurements, satellite data, and air quality model simulations to generate 1 km resolution national PM2.5 mass and major constituent (sulfates, nitrates, elemental carbon, organic carbon, lead, and nickel) exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 1). Using cohort data from 2007 to 2020 for our main analyses, we will use Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the associations of long-term exposures to PM2.5 constituents and adverse cardiovascular outcomes including total CVD, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke (Aim 2). Variations of this model will be used to investigate the shape of the C-R functions (linear vs. non-linear) as well as the impact of exposure errors using exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 2a). We will also examine windows of susceptibility for CVD endpoints using both time-variant and time- invariant exposure metrics (Aim 2b). Finally, we will evaluate the confounding effect of indoor air pollution on the C-R functions using a sub-cohort with estimated personal PM2.5 exposure estimates based on Fuwai Hospital's ongoing Multi-Region Panel Study (Aim 2c). Expected Results. Given the tremendous variability in PM2.5 constituent concentrations in China over time and space, our findings will contribute new PM2.5 constituent-specific C-R functions in CVD burden calculation in both the US and the world. Our study will also expand our knowledge on important factors affecting these associations such as exposure window and indoor air pollution. Narrative This study will assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in a retrospective multi-cohort study. Usinig five national cohorts and multi-city indoor air pollution measurements in China, we will investigate the shape of the CVD concentration-response functions and the impacts of indoor air pollution and exposure windows.

"Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal and postnatal childhood exposure to metals, essential and non-essential, is ubiquitous via dietary and environmental sources. Heavy metals, including lead and methylmercury, are well characterized as potent neurotoxicants, associated with lower cognition and poor learning abilities. Yet, our understanding of the neurotoxicity and joint impact of many other common prenatal and postnatal metal exposures remains extremely limited. Even less is known about the combined impact of exposure to multiple metals during fetal development or postnatal exposure during early childhood, or the influence of other environmental mixtures such as nutrients, which may have shared sources, on the neurodevelopmental effects of metals. To address this significant gap, our long-term goal is to quantify the neurocognitive impact of ubiquitous prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and identify cord blood DNA methylation biomarkers that can reconstruct prenatal environmental exposures and predict future neurocognitive development in children. We will test if objective measures of key prenatal maternal nutrients, such as folate, vitamin B12 and essential metals attenuate or mitigate the neurotoxicity of metal mixtures. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage resources from an established U.S. pre-birth cohort, Project Viva. In this cohort, we have measured concentrations for 14 prenatal maternal metals in the first trimester of pregnancy and blood samples collected in early-childhood (~3 years) ready for metal testing as well as ready to use genome-wide cord blood DNA methylation screens. Children have been followed prospectively and undergone detail testing for neurodevelopment in early (~3 years of age) and mid-childhood (~7 years). We hypothesize that prenatal maternal 1st trimester and postnatal early childhood neurotoxic metal mixtures are associated with poor neurodevelopment in early and mid-childhood (Aim 1), and that prenatal first trimester maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and blood concentration of essential metals protect against prenatal metal mixture neurotoxicity (Aim 2). We also hypothesize that DNA methylation marks measured in umbilical cord blood at birth can reconstruct prenatal exposure to metals (Aim 3.a) and that cord blood DNAm marks predict future neurocognitive development in early and mid-childhood (Aim 3.b). By testing longitudinal associations in a large cohort of children with detail cognitive assessments as well as objective biomarkers of metals and nutrients, we will overcome limitations currently faced by existing studies testing few exposures simultaneously. We will use novel statistical methodology to model prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and machine learning algorithms to build epigenetic predictors of exposure and neurodevelopment. This research will provide a comprehensive quantification of the cognitive burden of prenatal and postnatal mixtures, the development of biomarkers of exposure and neurodevelopment and the identification of potential prenatal nutritional intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood decrements in neurocognitive development result in large population burden and expenditure. The proposed research will identify the extent to which prenatal and postnatal neurotoxic mixtures as well as key prenatal nutrients jointly influence neurocognitive development in childhood.

"Leveraging EHR data to evaluate key treatment decisions to prevent suicide-related behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Key focus: Research leveraging EHR data (PAR-18-929) to prevent suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) Objectives: To use augmented Veterans Health Administration (VHA) EHR data to develop Personalized Treatment Rules (PTRs) to help guide clinicians in making key treatment decisions for mentally ill patients aimed at reducing SRBs over the next 12 months. Specific aims: We will focus on two decisions: the decision of primary care physicians on how to treat patients coming to them for help with common mental disorders (CMD; “the PCP study”); and the decision of VHA Suicide Prevention Coordinators on whether to hospitalize patients who just made nonfatal suicide attempts or treat them as outpatients (“the SPC study”). Both are recognized as critical decisions, with no globally optimal treatment path for either and little guidance on how to decide among the treatment options. Research design: We will use a prospective observational design. The PCP study will be based on EHR data for the roughly 583,000 incident PCP visits of VHA patients for help with a CMD in 2010-2016. An incident visit will be defined as where the patient had not received other CMD treatment in the prior 12 months. The five broad PCP treatment options are pharmacotherapy, referral to psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy plus measurement based collaborative care, and referral to a psychiatrist. The outcomes will be either an SRB (the primary outcome, either suicide death or administratively-recorded nonfatal suicide attempt) over the next 12 months or psychiatric hospitalization with suicidality over the same follow-up period (the secondary outcome). These outcomes occurred after 12,292 2010-2016 incident visits. The SPC study will be based on the 67,196 2010-2016 VHA Suicide Behavior Reports completed after a nonfatal VHA outpatient suicide attempt. Roughly half of these cases were hospitalized and the others treated as outpatients. A repeat SRB occurred over the next 12 months for 19,829 of these cases. Methods: A best-practice method of balancing baseline covariates will be used to adjust for nonrandom assignment across treatment options. Baseline covariates will include: prior EHR data; EHR data available for the focal treatment decision, including information abstracted from clinical notes with natural language processing; small-area geocode data for patient addresses; individual-level data from the LexisNexis Social Determinants of Health Database on patient finances, employment, marital status, and criminal justice involvement; and information about prior practice patterns of treating clinicians and practices-resources of treatment settings. A cutting-edge ensemble machine learning method will be used to analyze these weighted data to develop PTRs. Cross-validation in the 2010-2016 data and validation in 2017-2018 data (not available until the third year of the study) will be used to estimate out-of-sample performance of the PTRs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop precision treatment rules for (i) primary care physicians trying to develop a treatment plan for patients seeking treatment for common mental disorders and (ii) suicide prevention coordinators trying to develop a treatment plan for a patient who just made a nonfatal suicide attempt with the goal of developing a plan that will minimize prevalence of suicide-related behaviors (either suicide deaths or nonfatal attempts) over the next 12 months. The work will be carried out in the Veterans Health Administration system, but will have implications for the broader population. The research has the potential to have great public health significance given that suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) are important public health problems, that the decisions we will study occur very often and have important effects on SRBs, that clinicians currently have no clear guidance on how to make these decisions, and that the design we propose to use has a high probability of success because of a number of important advantages over the designs used in previous studies.",Leveraging EHR data to evaluate key treatment decisions to prevent suicide-related

"Integrating epidemiologic and environmental approaches to understand and predict Coccidioides exposure and coccidioidomycosis emergence Project Summary Coccidioidomycosis is an infection caused by inhalation of spores from the soil-dwelling fungi Coccidioides immitis or C. posadasii, and can lead to chronic lung infection, meningitis, or death. Southwestern states are currently experiencing among the highest incidence rates of coccidioidomycosis ever recorded. The disease has levied a substantial human and economic burden throughout the southwest, totaling an estimated $2.2 billion in charges in California alone for coccidioidomycosis-associated hospitalizations from 2000-2011. Critical gaps in understanding have hindered the public health response, including how dust, pathogen, and individual risk factors interact to determine disease incidence, as well as how environmental factors influence the distribution of the pathogen and dust. To address these gaps, this project investigates the impacts of dust exposure, environmental variability, and sociodemographic change on Coccidioides spp. proliferation, dispersion, and coccidioidomycosis infection rates in California. The research focuses on three main aims: 1) investigate the influence of climate variation and dust exposure on the spatiotemporal distribution of cocci incidence using >65,000 geolocated surveillance records from 2000 to 2018 and a case-crossover design; 2) identify environmental sources of C. immitis at high spatial and temporal resolution in disturbed and undisturbed soil, and determine how wind, rainfall, soil disturbance and other factors influence spore dispersion through longitudinal sampling of C. immitis in air and soil; and 3) predict changes in pathogen density over space and time and estimate the exposure-response relationship between pathogen density and risk of infection using a case-crossover approach with prospective surveillance for incident cases. In pursuit of these aims, the research will combine georeferenced coccidioidomycosis case data across California since 2000 at an unprecedented spatial resolution with fine-scale dust concentration estimates and environmental data from a combination of remote sensing, modeling and ground monitors. We will use novel field and laboratory methods to conduct longitudinal sampling of C. immitis in air and soil, determining how microenvironmental conditions and cyclical patterns of rainfall and drought determine pathogen source dynamics, and identifying conditions that support pathogen dispersion through the air. Through these activities, we will identify the specific dust conditions that pose the greatest risk for infection, estimate pathogen exposure and the dose- response relationship, and evaluate heterogeneity in this relationship across risk groups and regions. The results will elucidate drivers of the current epidemic, enhance understanding of the distribution and dispersion of Coccidioides spp. in the environment, and identify high risk regions and subpopulations. The knowledge gained will support decision-makers in targeting, designing and implementing protective measures for vulnerable populations. Project Narrative This project addresses gaps in our understanding of the kinds of dust exposures, and the environmental and social conditions, that increase the incidence of coccidioidomycosis in the southwest. The findings will have wide-ranging benefits for public health, including a better understanding of how people are exposed to the pathogen, the identification of areas and people that are at the highest risk, and predictions of future coccidioidomycosis that can be used to prevent infection in vulnerable groups.",Integrating epidemiologic and environmental approaches to understand and predict Coccidioides exposure and coccidioidomycosis emergence,9865174,R01AI148336,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Air ', ' California ', ' Charge ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Coccidioides ', ' Coccidioides immitis ', ' C immitis ', ' C. immitis ', ' Coccidioidomycosis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Droughts ', ' Dust ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' fungus ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Influenza ', ' Grippe ', ' flu infection ', ' influenza infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Meningitis ', ' Meteorology ', ' Methods ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Soil ', ' Reproduction spores ', ' Spores ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Environmental Wind ', ' Wind ', ' Measures ', ' TimeLine ', ' density ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Cross-Over Designs ', ' Crossover Design ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' high temperature ', ' High temperature of physical object ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' participatory sensing ', ' remote sensing ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Resolution ', ' Subgroup ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' pathogen exposure ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Pathogen detection ', ' environmental intervention ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' C posadasii ', ' C. posadasii ', ' Coccidioides posadasii ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal measurement ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' pulmonary infections ', ' Lung infections ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' infection risk ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' rate of infection ', ' infection rate ', ' Climatology ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,774446,0.10176810472106289
"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9954064,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol

"Prediction of suicide death using EHR and polygenic risk scores ABSTRACT Suicide is a leading cause of death that continues to increase, with over 47,000 preventable suicide deaths per year in the U.S. Although we have made great strides in using electronic health records (EHR) and other factors to predict suicidal ideation and behavior, our ability to reliably predict suicide death is close to zero. From a healthcare standpoint, predicting suicide deaths is tricky. We know that the incidence of suicide behaviors is far more common (~4%-5% per year) compared to suicide death (~0.01%-0.02% per year). Essentially, only a small fraction of those who engage in suicidal behaviors will go on to die by suicide. Knowledge of who these highest risk individuals are is critically important in directing prevention efforts and development of future targeted interventions. In addition, well over half of suicide deaths occur with no prior attempts, even accounting for lack of documentation of attempts in diagnostic codes. These “out of the blue” cases suggest one or more high-risk groups even more elusive to accurate prediction and prevention. Including genetic data of suicide deaths may offer substantial predictive improvement; genetic factors account for close to 50% of the risk of suicide death. Using the extensive genetic data, statewide longitudinal EHR resources, demographic, and familial data available to the Utah Suicide Genetic Risk Study (USGRS), we are uniquely poised to address this critical knowledge gap. Our primary focus will be to use machine learning methods develop models that predict suicide deaths. In addition, our large suicide death research resource will also allow us to model differences of suicide deaths with vs. without prior attempts. Of the ~9,000 Utah suicide deaths with demographics and environmental data, familial data, and 2 decades of longitudinal EHR data, the USGRS also currently has DNA from >6,000, which will increase to ~10,000 during the award period. Genome- wide molecular data is in hand for over 5,000 of these Utah suicides, allowing for tests of association of suicide subtypes identified using EHR data with “genetic phenotypes” represented by polygenic risk scores. The USGRS also has demographics, familial data, and longitudinal EHR data from 5 age/sex- matched Utah population controls for each suicide death, allowing for comparisons of non-lethal attempts to suicide deaths. In addition, we will collaborate with colleagues at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, who are currently developing EHR and polygenic risk models to study substance use disorder, anxiety, and major depressive disorder in 37,510 participants in the Mount Sinai BioMe Biorepository. They will expand this work to include suicidality to provide an additional resource of suicide attempt for our model development and testing. We will additionally study polygenic risk scores associated with suicide death vs. attempt using our resources, Mount Sinai BioMe, and a collaboration with Vanderbilt University for access to their Biobank and to suicide attempts in the UK Biobank.. Independent validation will be possible through genotyping of new Utah suicides collected throughout the project, with additional comparisons to attempt cases in large datasets available through the PsychEMERGE consortium. NARRATIVE We will develop and validate models to predict suicide death, as distinct from suicide attempt, using electronic health records (EHR), demographics, environmental stresses, familial risks, and genetic differences. We will use 9,000 Utah suicides with longitudinal EHR data (>5,000 of these with molecular data growing to 10,000 by the end of the study), Utah population controls, collaborations with Mount Sinai Medical School and Vanderbilt University, and validation/replication with the large EHR and molecular data resources in the PsychEMERGE Consortium.",Prediction of suicide death using EHR and polygenic risk scores,10027263,R01MH123489,"['Accounting ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Hand ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Medical Examiners ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Population Control ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Stress ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Area ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' model development ', ' clinical depression ', ' major depression ', ' major depression disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Collection ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' sex ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' comparator group ', ' comparison group ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' data resource ', ' early life stress ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' machine learning method ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,738338,0.13757827905846967
"The impact of social media use on precursors of adolescent suicide risk: A prospective study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is the second leading cause of adolescent mortality in the US. Rates of adolescent suicide have increased in recent years, along with the advent and growth of social media use (SMU) in this population. SMU has been linked with sleep disruption, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation (SI), all of which are precursors of suicidal behavior. Existing research on the impact of SMU on sleep, mood, and suicidality is limited by cross- sectional designs and self-reported measures of SMU and sleep. To advance the field, prospective designs are needed that include objective measures and intensive monitoring of high-risk samples to rigorously examine the temporal relationships between SMU and suicide risk, defined as depressed mood and SI. This K01 proposal uses precisely such a design to test a conceptual model in which SMU predicts sleep disruption, which, in turn, contributes to depressed mood and SI among adolescents. The proposed study will harness smartphone technology to assess SMU using real-time passive data capture, actigraphy, and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in high-risk adolescents. These methods, combined with in-person study visits, will examine the temporal and unique within-person associations between SMU and sleep disruption (Aim 1), SMU and suicide risk (Aim 2), and test whether sleep disruption mediates the relationship between SMU and suicide risk (Aim 3). Data-driven approaches of supervised machine learning will leverage the high-dimensional, intensively- monitored data to identify key SMU features predictive of suicide risk in adolescents (Exploratory Aim). The candidate will build on her strong foundation in adolescent depression and sleep research by acquiring new conceptual and methodological training in: 1) adolescent suicide risk, 2) technology and mental health, including social media use and mobile technology for real-time assessment; and 3) advanced computational skills. The candidate has assembled an interdisciplinary mentorship team to achieve her training goals within the exceptional environment of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh. Mentors (Brent and Moreno) are experts in adolescent suicide and social media, respectively, and both have had success in mentoring early career scientists. The candidate’s consultants have extensive expertise in adolescent development and EMA (Silk), adolescent sleep and actigraphy (Franzen), smartphone sensing (Ferreira) applied to clinical health (Low), and advanced statistical and machine learning approaches (Wallace). The proposed training and research will inform future R01 studies that use these innovative methods to identify and modify clinically-actionable risk factors, including SMU and sleep disruption, to attenuate near-term risk for adolescent suicide. This program of research has the potential to yield high-impact results that inform the development of suicide prevention programs that are personalized, scalable, and delivered in real time. The proposed research along with this training plan will uniquely position the candidate to be an independent investigator and leading scholar in the important public health problem of adolescent suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescent suicide and suicidality have increased in recent years, which parallels the advent and rapid growth of social media use in adolescents’ daily lives. The proposed study will be the first in a broader program of research that leverages smartphone technology to examine how social media use impacts risk for the development and worsening of suicidal ideation and behavior among adolescents. This research program aims to identify modifiable risk factors, including social media use and sleep disruption, for adolescent suicide risk, and ultimately, contribute to the development of interventions that are personalized, scalable, and delivered in real time to prevent suicide.",The impact of social media use on precursors of adolescent suicide risk: A prospective study,10054721,K01MH121584,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arousal ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Moods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' poor sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' statistics ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Silk ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' career ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Attenuated ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' ideation ', ' Scientist ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' sleep onset ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' rapid growth ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' adolescent depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' pediatric depression ', ' youth depression ', ' child depression ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' modifiable risk ', ' Affective ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized intervention ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' clinically actionable ', ' social media ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile computing ', ' digital media ', ' high-risk adolescents ', ' secondary analysis ', ' high dimensionality ', ' recruit ', ' adolescent suicide ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2020,58402,0.04274055486973313
"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. The proposed program will apply a novel dental biomarker of exposure to multiple chemicals and cutting-edge statistical methods to identify specific life stages including perinatal periods that correspond to increased susceptibility to neurodevelopmental effects of metal toxicant mixtures.",Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture,10005934,R01ES026033,"['Affect ', ' Arsenic ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Manganese ', ' Mn element ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexico ', ' Organic Chemicals ', ' Phenotype ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 2nd trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Third Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 3rd trimester ', ' Last Trimester ', ' Third Trimester ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Tooth ', ' teeth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Work ', ' Zinc ', ' Zn element ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Chemicals ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Dental ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' neurotoxicology ', ' early childhood ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Nutrient ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Genetic Toxicology ', ' Toxicology Genetics ', ' Toxicogenetics ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Sum ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' cost ', ' Neurodevelopmental Deficit ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' exposure to metal ', ' Metal exposure ', ' toxic exposure ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' 8 years of age ', ' age 8 years ', ' eight year old ', ' eight years of age ', ' 8 year old ', ' developmental neurotoxicity ', ' neurotoxic ', ' public health relevance ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' early life exposure ', ' high dimensionality ', ' perinatal phase ', ' perinatal period ', ' neurodevelopment effect ', ' neurodevelopmental effect ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,604973,0.04971421529302652
"Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design Patients, clinicians, and policymakers often need valid information about the real-world effects of drugs and other exposures for which there have been pronounced time-trends in use. For example, the rapid growth in the use of rofecoxib in the early 2000s and of exogenous testosterone from 2000–2013 was accompanied by an urgent need for knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of those drugs. Randomized trials seldom enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or follow them long enough, to examine associations with rare outcomes. Therefore, non-randomized studies are needed, even though they are susceptible to unmeasured confounding and other forms of bias. To address these limitations of available epidemiologic designs, we recently introduced the trend-in-trend design: a novel, hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic research design that is applicable when there is a prominent trend in the use of the study exposure. Substantial additional development is needed to realize the full public health impact of the trend-in-trend research design. Areas in most need of development include: evaluation of a sequential analysis extension for real-time post-marketing safety surveillance; evaluation of machine learning to specify the trend-in-trend design’s underlying cumulative probability of exposure model; evaluation of dose-response relationships; and evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity based on baseline patient characteristics. For each of these methodologic needs, we propose an approach for which we will: 1) assess its statistical properties, in particular large-sample validity through asymptotics and finite sample statistical power; 2) evaluate its performance in thorough simulation studies; and 3) proof-test the approach using the known association between rofecoxib-acute myocardial infarction in healthcare data. Finally, we will apply these developments to the unresolved and highly important question of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men. This study will have broad scientific, clinical, and public health impact by greatly extending the utility of a novel epidemiologic research design with demonstrated validity and is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. It will also evaluate the safety of exogenous testosterone, a question of tremendous clinical and public health importance. Examining the safety of prescription drugs is one enormously important application of this design that has the potential to benefit many millions of people. As the trend-in-trend design is also applicable to non-drug exposures that have a pronounced time-trend (e.g., medical procedures, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, etc.), its potential impact on the population is even broader. This project will enhance the utility of the trend-in-trend research design, a novel hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic design that is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. Further, we will leverage these methods developments to study the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety of exogenous testosterone, unanswered questions of tremendous clinical and public health importance for older adult males.",Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design,10017817,R01AG064589,"['Adoption ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' NSAIDs ', ' Non Steroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drug ', ' non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs ', ' nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Heart Arrest ', ' Asystole ', ' Cardiac Arrest ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hybrids ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Pulmonary Embolism ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Safety ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Epidemiologic Research Design ', ' Epidemiological Research Design ', ' Testing ', ' Testosterone ', ' Therapeutic Testosterone ', ' Trans-Testosterone ', ' Time ', ' Ventricular Arrhythmia ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Deep-Venous Thrombosis ', ' Deep Vein Thrombosis ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' COX-2 protein ', ' COX2 enzyme ', ' Cyclo-Oxygenase-2 ', ' PGH Synthase 2 ', ' PGHS2 ', ' PHS II ', ' Prostaglandin G/H Synthase 2 ', ' Prostaglandin H2 Synthase 2 ', ' Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase 2 ', ' cyclo-oxygenase II ', ' prostaglandin H synthase-2 ', ' cyclooxygenase 2 ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Vioxx ', ' Rofecoxib ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Calendar ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' life-style factor ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observational Study ', ' trend ', ' To specify ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cerebral vascular ', ' cerebro-vascular ', ' cerebrovascular ', ' time use ', ' rapid growth ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' treatment effect ', ' nondrug ', ' non-drug ', ' population health ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' trend analysis ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Time trend ', ' venous thromboembolism ', ' safety outcomes ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,549226,0.08061291274527752
"The Impact of Temperature and Pollution on Mortality, Morbidity, and Health Care Cost Among the Elderly OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Determinants of Vulnerability to Environmental Stress Among the Elderly ADRD Population As individuals live longer, healthier lives, the number of people living with, and dying from, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has risen. AD prevalence and mortality are expected to continue to rise in the future. However, while AD is fatal and individuals living with AD have high mortality rates, their immediate cause of death is usually respiratory disease or ischemic heart disease rather than dementia. Consequently, improving the health and quality of life of people living with ADRD depends on understanding their vulnerability to these diseases, and how these conditions interact with their dementia. Our proposed study focuses on the determinants of health and mortality among those in the Medicare population who have been identified as living with ADRD. Because cardiovascular and respiratory diseases have been identified as frequent causes of death among the ADRD population, we focus on an environmental stressor that increases the likelihood of death due to cardiovascular and respiratory causes: acute exposure to air pollution. Using a large dataset of Medicare beneficiaries and machine-learning techniques applied to quasi-random variation in pollution exposure generated by changes in local wind direction, we find that acute exposure to air pollution increases mortality risk for only about one quarter of the elderly. While individuals living with ADRD are much more likely to be in this vulnerable group than the typical Medicare beneficiary, we find that acute air pollution exposure does not increase mortality risk for a large fraction (44%) of Medicare beneficiaries living with ADRD. In this study, we will apply machine learning and “big data” techniques to Medicare administrative data, local characteristics, and atmospheric variables in order to understand why some individuals living with ADRD suffer harm from the increased cardiovascular and respiratory stress induced by air pollution exposure while others do not. These factors, once identified and verified in continuing research, will provide guidance that can improve the health and quality of life of individuals living with ADRD by better directing resources to those most in need and guiding interventions aimed at reducing vulnerability to these and other hazards. As part of the project, we will develop a publicly available database that provides the following data at the ZIP code level: ADRD prevalence, vulnerability to air pollution exposure among the ADRD population, and ZIP code level characteristics that have been shown to affect vulnerability. Other researchers can then use this data for any other study seeking to understand the effects of geographically defined factors or policies on the ADRD population. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative While Alzheimer’s disease is a fatal form of dementia, the top two immediate causes of death for people with Alzheimer’s disease are respiratory illness (55.5%) and ischemic heart disease (23.1%), which are both exacerbated by exposure to environmental hazards such as air pollution. In this study, we will apply machine learning and “big data” techniques to Medicare administrative data in order to identify risk factors that predict vulnerability to the harmful effects of pollution exposure for individuals living with ADRD, allowing for better targeting of resources to those most in need and contributing to the improvement of interventions aimed at reducing vulnerability to these and other hazards.","The Impact of Temperature and Pollution on Mortality, Morbidity, and Health Care Cost Among the Elderly",10123225,R01AG053350,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Air Pollution ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Temperature ', ' Environmental Wind ', ' Wind ', ' Environmental Hazards ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' cardiac ischemia ', ' coronary ischemia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pollution ', ' Techniques ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' respiratory ', ' environmental stressor ', ' hazard ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' beneficiary ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,R01,2020,376508,-0.04010209677978321
"BRINGING MODERN DATA SCIENCE TOOLS TO BEAR ON ENVIRONMENTAL MIXTURES Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Environmental exposure mixtures, especially when coupled with social stressors, have the potential to compromise developmental outcomes in children, but have been understudied. We will use a unique longitudinal dataset that tracks children from birth through early elementary school, in combination with new tools from modern data science, to disentangle the complex effects of these mixtures on educational outcomes.",BRINGING MODERN DATA SCIENCE TOOLS TO BEAR ON ENVIRONMENTAL MIXTURES,10273235,R01ES028819,"['Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Birth Records ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Carbon Monoxide ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Cox Models ', ' Crime ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Geography ', ' Housing ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Mothers ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nitrogen Dioxide ', ' Nitrogen Peroxide ', ' North Carolina ', ' Ozone ', ' Particle Size ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Siblings ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Sulfur Dioxide ', ' Sulfurous Anhydride ', ' Taxes ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' jobless ', ' joblessness ', ' out of work ', ' unemployed ', ' Work ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' grade school ', ' elementary school ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' pollutant ', ' simulation ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' social stress ', ' deprivation ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' exposed to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposure to lead ', ' lead exposed ', ' lead exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Data Science ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' data resource ', ' rural environment ', ' Child Health ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' social stressor ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2020,608093,0.07283575399420043
"Automated Detection of Suicide Attempt Risk among Bereaved Individuals Project Summary Bereaved individuals, especially those who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) and those bereaved by suicide, have substantial risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. These vulnerable bereaved subgroups are also less likely to receive informal support or access mental health care, creating a pressing need to detect their suicide risk. Each year, well over a thousand unsolicited bereaved individuals visit our Cornell Center for Research on End-of-Life Care website and complete an online tool to determine if they meet criteria for PGD (over 6,000 completers to date). Compared to community-based bereaved samples, those who complete our online tool disproportionately meet criteria for PGD (e.g., ~30% vs. ~10%) and are suicide bereaved (~10% vs. ~2%). Thus, astoundingly, >35% of those who visit our Center website and complete our online diagnostic tool are at significantly elevated risk for suicidal ideation and/or attempts. To respond to the need to detect suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) among our bereaved website visitors, we propose to develop a web-based tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk. We will leverage our Living Memory Home, an online memorial application residing on our Center website, by enhancing its features to optimize data collection, including data on potential implicit indicators of a bereaved person's suicide attempt risk (Aim #1). Data will be gathered on 100 Living Memory Home users daily for a week, followed by a 1-week, 1- and 6-month post-baseline follow-up assessment. The study will generate ~30 texts/subject in the Living Memory Home's Imagined Dialogues with the deceased, and reflections, dreams, stories, and touchstones in Narrative Notes (~3,000 texts in total from all users). Boot-strapping resampling, natural language processing and machine learning techniques will then be applied to develop machine learning models predicting suicide attempt risk based on bereaved subjects' baseline, 1-week, 1- and 6-month Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale scores (Aim #2). Our primary outcome will be the 1-week CSSRS score. We will, thus, develop and then pilot test an automated way to detect bereaved persons'; suicide attempt risk based on their interactions with the Living Memory Home. This is a first step toward development of a safe, accurate, potentially scalable online tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk among bereaved individuals. Project Narrative (Relevance) Bereaved individuals, and particularly those bereaved by suicide and who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder, are at substantially elevated risk for suicidal thoughts and attempts. This project, applying machine learning techniques to detect suicidal attempt risk among bereaved individuals using an online bereavement resource, the Living Memory Home, is a first step in the development of a safe and effective online tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk among bereaved individuals.",Automated Detection of Suicide Attempt Risk among Bereaved Individuals,9885577,R21MH121886,"['Bereavement ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dreams ', ' dreaming ', ' Future ', ' Grief reaction ', ' Grief ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Persons ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Savings ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' United Kingdom ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' metropolitan ', ' skills ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' Reporting ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Subgroup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' suicide model ', ' expressive writing therapy ', ' expressive writing ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' suicidal individual ', ' loved ones ', ' primary outcome ', ' followup assessment ', ' follow up assessment ', ' informal support ', ' web-based tool ', ' recruit ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' ']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2020,248112,0.12117162968857212
"Linking VA and non-VA data to study the risk of suicide in chronic pain patients. PROJECT SUMMARY The overall objective of this proposal is to integrate large-scale VA and non-VA data across New York, Chicago and Florida to study the risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide and accidental opioid overdose deaths in Veterans receiving chronic opioid therapy (COT). PROJECT ABSTRACT Opioid misuse and its associated risks of suicide is a national public health emergency. Current estimates suggest that chronic pain impacts nearly half of Veterans, and studies have shown that people who experience chronic pain are at increased risk for a number of adverse health outcomes, including suicide and opioid overdose. Although multiple national initiatives within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) have attempted to decrease the number of veterans with opioid prescriptions for pain management, these efforts focus on analyzing VA data only. Given that many Veterans receive care and treatment from non-VA community clinics and medical centers, it is imperative to study suicide or accidental overdose risk amongst Veterans with pain disorders by analyzing both VA and non-VA data. The overall objective of this proposal is to integrate large-scale VA and non-VA data across New York, Chicago and Florida to study the risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide and accidental opioid overdose deaths in Veterans receiving chronic opioid therapy (COT).",Linking VA and non-VA data to study the risk of suicide in chronic pain patients.,9877596,R01MH121907,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Firearms ', ' Florida ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Services Administration ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Standardization ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Time ', ' Veterans ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' chronic pain ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' health administration ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' homeless ', ' unhoused ', ' Homelessness ', ' Individual ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pain Disorder ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modeling ', ' deprivation ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Text ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' suicide rate ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' data modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' data integration ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' ethanol misuse ', ' unhealthy alcohol use ', ' alcohol misuse ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' demographics ', ' Medicare claim ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' electronic structure ', ' overdose death ', ' risk mitigation ', ' public health emergency ', ' social health determinants ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' prescription opioid ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid use ', ' opiate therapy ', ' opioid therapy ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opiate deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid related death ', ' opioid mortality ', ' care fragmentation ', ' patient with chronic pain ', ' chronic pain patient ', ' overdose risk ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data repository ', ' data warehouse ', ' non-medical opioid use ', ' nonmedical opioid use ', ' opiate misuse ', ' opioid misuse ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' community clinic ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,808310,-0.10102290983486323
"Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention One hundred and twenty-three Americans die by suicide every day, and 800,000 individuals die from suicide globally every year. Five times as many people attempt suicide and 10-25 times as many contemplate suicide every year. Rates of suicidal thoughts or ideation and suicidal behaviors are increasing. Suicidal ideation alone causes mental and physical harm and is associated with worsened statuses of other illnesses. Suicidal ideation is often documented by clinical providers in their notes but has been shown to only be included in diagnostic or billing codes 3% of the time. Historical suicide attempts are also under- captured by billing codes alone. Improving identification of those with suicidal ideation and attempts might enhance prevention through earlier contact with those at risk.  A growing literature shows that clinical predictive models with longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) can predict suicide attempts with good performance. These models have also been used by groups like ours to improve power of large-scale genetic analyses of suicide attempt risk. The investigators used their validated models to identify the signal for suicide attempt, a “phenotype”, to run genetic analyses showing suicide attempt risk is 4% heritable. This team also showed that suicide attempt risk was significantly genetically correlated with depressive symptoms, neurotic symptoms, and schizophrenia.  The investigators propose to validate a phenotype of suicidal ideation and to improve their existing phenotypes of attempt risk to power large-scale genetic analyses across two major biobanks, Vanderbilt’s BioVU and the UK Biobank. They will use natural language processing (NLP) and analytics on Vanderbilt’s EHR to develop and test a phenotype of suicidal ideation. They will use NLP to improve capture of cases of suicide attempt to refine existing algorithms. They will apply these phenotypes at scale to BioVU. Their Stanford team members will use patient-reported suicidal ideation histories in another major biobank, UK Biobank, to independently run genetic analyses of suicidal ideation risk in a different population. They will further analyze clinical and genetic risk factors to better understand who will transition from suicidal ideation to suicide attempt.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and large-scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in suicide risk research. Spanning two major biobanks across two countries, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next-step investigations. Successful identification of suicidal ideation and attempt risk might inform clinical prevention. Better understanding of risk factors that predict who will proceed from suicidal ideation to suicidal behaviors would help allocate prevention resources to those who need them most. Project Narrative  Suicide is one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States and 10-25 times the number that die contemplate suicide every year. Large gaps remain in our understanding of genetic risk factors of suicidal ideation and attempt as well as genetic and clinical risk factors that contribute to transition from ideation to attempt. This investigation will use natural language processing, machine learning, electronic health records for over 1 million people, and two major biobanks from the United States and the United Kingdom to study the clinical and genetic risk factors necessary to improve identification of patients at highest risk of suicidal behaviors.",Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention,9859704,R01MH121455,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Literature ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Neurotic Disorders ', ' Neuroses ', ' Psychoneuroses ', ' neurotic ', ' neuroticism ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' United Kingdom ', ' United States ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Family Study ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Investigation ', ' suicidal ', ' Country ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' Genomics ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genetic association ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Heritability ', ' open source ', ' high risk ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' clinical risk ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' clinical predictors ', ' Genetic study ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' Risk stratification ', ' genetic architecture ', ' structured data ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' ']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,561236,0.13342722162842807
"CHABMAP (Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Bloom Mapping and Analyses Platform) technology automates the quantification of toxic CyanoHABs exposure epochs for any waterbody. Specific Aim #1: Operationalize spatio-temporal CyanoHAB exposure epoch metrics  • Fuse multi-scale and disparate satellite remote sensing platforms and automate retrievals over  space and time to derive CyanoHAB exposure metrics. We will build enterprise software to fully  automate the harmonization and fusion of NASA’s Landsat-8 OLI and ESA’s Sentinel-2 and  Sentinel-3 satellite platforms to provide long-term (1984-present) moderate spatial resolution  (30meter pixels) and high temporal frequency CyanoHAB exposure metrics (Cyanobacteria  Intensity, Color Dissolved Organic Matter, Total Suspended Solids, Floating Algae Index,  Chlorophyll-a Concentration, & toxins). The decision support tool automates epoch synthesis to  understand incubation periods and exposure triggers for neurodegenerative diseases. Specific Aim #2: Scale on-demand CHABMAP commercial product services  • Scale and implement CHABMAP data services for infinite scalability using BigData cloud  technologies. This Aim involves three main development efforts: adapting our proprietary  Geospatial Image and Processing System (GIPS) capabilities to an AWS-deployable auto-scaling  cluster, creation of user interfaces and application programming interfaces (APIs) to interact with  these services, and enhancements to the base GIPS framework to facilitate intercommunication  between remote GIPS-enabled archives and the cloud processing streams. This includes the  creation of deployable compute instances, optimization of computation and parallelization  specific to AWS deployment, optimization of temporary and long-term storage of intermediate  products, and optimization of communication and data transfer with end users.

"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",9910447,R01MH100155,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anxiety ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Future ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Institutes ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Oppositional Defiant Disorder ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Glean ', ' disorder of conduct ', ' disorders of conduct ', ' Conduct Disorder ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicidal ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' trend ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' computerized ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' adolescent depression ', ' adolescents with depression ', ' childhood depression ', ' childhood onset depression ', ' depressed adolescents ', ' depression in adolescence ', ' pediatric depression ', ' youth depression ', ' child depression ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' suicidal youth ', ' suicidal adolescent ', ' high risk ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Positive Valence ', ' prospective test ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' recruit ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' adolescent suicide ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,721582,0.06510525589135115
"Role of Epigenetically Active  Environmental Compounds in Neurodevelopmental Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), are increasingly recognized as originating from dysregulation of early brain development, which represents a window of vulnerability to environmental compounds. Environmental compounds may alter neurodevelopment via epigenetic mechanisms, which may not induce massive cell death, but change the brain function through their epigenetic effect on stem cell fate and lineage development. However, tools to systematically examine the epigenetic impact of environment on neurodevelopment are lacking. Here we employ Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape (MIEL) to screen ToxCast Phase III chemical library (4700 compounds) and to characterize hits that alter epigenetic landscape of human neural precursors without inducing cytotoxicity. Recognizing environmental insults and understanding their mechanism of action will enable the development of regulations and guidelines aimed at avoiding such insults and the development of antidotes and protective agents when exposure is unavoidable. PROJECT NARRATIVE We developed a novel technique rooted in analysis of the epigenome topography at the single-cell level.

"Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data PROJECT ABSTRACT Suicide is one of the leading causes of death. As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. While white males between 45 and 64 years of age are 4 times more likely than females to die by suicide, females attempt suicide 3 times as often as males. Recent data suggest that there are 20 times as many suicide attempts, which is generally considered a high and consistent risk factor for subsequent suicide. However, predicting and monitoring when someone will attempt self-harm and suicide has been nearly impossible. In this project, we plan to leverage large-scale, integrated electronic health record and claims from the New York City Clinical Data Research Network to study the suicidality in relation to emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations. In particular, using data on >10 million patients, we will develop novel NLP and machine learning models to identify patients at highest risk for self-harm, suicide attempt and suicide, and conduct a pilot study to assess the clinical utility of such models. We will also conduct a validation study using similar data from Kaiser Permanente Washington. PROJECT NARRATIVE As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. Successful identification of patients who are at the risk of self-harm, suicide attempt, and suicide can lead potential clinical interventions for improving patient outcomes. This proposal will apply “big data” techniques to identify patients at risk of suicidal behavior using large-scale integrated clinical data.","Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data",9964905,R01MH119177,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Death Certificates ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discharge Plannings ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Female ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' male ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Time ', ' Washington ', ' Gender ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Presbyterians ', ' Presbyterian Church ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicidal ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Services ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' validation studies ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' model design ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' point of care ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' data integration ', ' Population ', ' suicide patient ', ' suicidal patient ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' data registry ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' insurance claims ', ' clinical decision support ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' risk prediction model ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,749141,0.1559583944146925
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9942495,R01HD089714,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Pollution ', ' environmental contaminant ', ' environmental contamination ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Developing fetus ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' IUGR ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Histology ', ' Industry ', ' Maps ', ' Methylation ', ' Mothers ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Pathology ', ' Placenta ', ' Cells Placenta-Tissue ', ' Normal Placentoma ', ' Placenta Embryonic Tissue ', ' Placentome ', ' Placenta Diseases ', ' Placenta Disorders ', ' Placental Diseases ', ' placental disorders ', ' Placental Insufficiency ', ' Placentation ', ' Placental Development ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' First Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 1st trimester ', ' Early Placental Phase ', ' First Trimester ', ' Second Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 2nd trimester ', ' Midtrimester ', ' Second Trimester ', ' Third Pregnancy Trimester ', ' 3rd trimester ', ' Last Trimester ', ' Third Trimester ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxin ', ' Measures ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Premature Birth ', ' Motor Vehicles ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Pollution ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' infant morbidity ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Normalities ', ' Normalcy ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' in vivo ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' transcriptomics ', ' implantation ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' therapeutic development ', ' primary outcome ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' BS-seq ', ' Bisulfite-based sequencing ', ' bisulfite-seq ', ' bisulfite sequencing ', ' MicroRNA Expression Profiling ', ' global miRNA profiling ', ' miRNA sequencing ', ' miRNA-seq ', ' micro RNA expression profiling ', ' microRNA sequencing ', ' miRNA expression profiling ', ' EWAS ', ' epigenome wide association analysis ', ' epigenome-wide association studies ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' exosome ', ' predictive signature ', ' imaging study ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,623441,0.16402178181707847
"Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction ABSTRACT In the next 60 minutes, at least 57 people in the United States (US) will attempt to kill themselves, and five will die. Over 80% of these individuals encountered a healthcare provider in the 12 months before his or her death, but their risk will have gone undetected or, if detected, poorly quantified and not sufficiently monitored longitudinally. The proposed research will address this deficit by building and validating the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale -- Expanded (CAT-SS EXPANDED), software that can screen for, quantify, and monitor suicide risk in a way far superior to existing instruments. It will enable at least three key Zero Suicide performance elements, including systematic, standardized frontline suicide risk screening and measurement (Identify), tracking and communicating risk across locations of care (Transitions), and monitoring changes in patient outcomes resulting from continuous quality improvement activities (Improve). In a paradigm shifting innovation, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will not only comprise the first multi-dimensional CAT of its kind, it will import suicide risk indicators that have already been validated by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) directly from a health system’s electronic health record (EHR). This SBIR Fast Track has two phases. Phase 1 will build the CAT-SS EXPANDED, starting with well-established preliminary work and using iterative user testing with 20 clinician-patient dyads to refine the features. Phase 2 will have two Aims. The first Aim will validate the CAT-SS EXPANDED against an independent research clinician’s suicide risk stratification and suicidal behavior 24 weeks after the index visit (n=700). The second Aim will complete two-way integration of the validated CAT-SS EXPANDED into UMass’ EHR production environment and will evaluate clinical usability and acceptability with a new sample of ~30 suicide-risk enriched patients. Innovation and Impact: While traditional suicide screening tools exist, they are very limited, a conclusion supported by systematic reviews, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, and the NIMH. Because of these limitations, strong, well-validated clinical decision support to guide appropriate levels of care do not exist, reinforcing non-standardized and inefficient workflow, such as a tendency to conservatively order unnecessary emergency psychiatric evaluations. The CAT-SS EXPANDED will address these well-known measurement limitations using cutting edge strategies embodied in multi-dimensional CAT and EHR-derived risk indicators, an unprecedented capability impossible to achieve with existing measures. While this study focuses on the ED as a starting point because of its well-known risk burden and emerging literature supporting the value of universal suicide risk screening combined with brief interventions, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will be specifically designed and later tested as the first approach to suicide risk monitoring suitable for enterprise deployment across settings and locations of care, which is transformational for suicide prevention and fundamental to the Zero Suicide model’s emphasis on holistic system change. NARRATIVE  Having a psychometrically valid suicide risk instrument that efficiently screens for risk, provides risk stratification, and can be used across settings and easily integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) has tremendous potential to enable the enterprise implementation of the Zero Suicide model across an entire healthcare system, regardless of location of care. Because the software we will create and validate, the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale – Expanded, blends computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and EHR suicide risk indicators previously validated using advanced analytic approaches by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network, it is markedly different from existing instruments, which focus on a specific setting or patient population, rely on obsolete administration and psychometric methods, contain only screening capability with no monitoring components, and are not EHR-integrated in such a way as to tap into the data stored in the EHRs. This SBIR Fast Track proposal is necessary to keep pace with the burgeoning adoption of electronic patient reported outcomes and EHRs across healthcare and is foundational to the next step of designing better suicide interventions.",Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction,10019729,R44MH118780,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Tests ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Schedule ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' Equation ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' professor ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Research Training ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' point of care ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' systematic review ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' suicide model ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' patient population ', ' secondary outcome ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' screening ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' data visualization ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Self-Direction ', ' substance misuse ', ' Risk stratification ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' clinical decision support ', ' risk prediction model ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NIMH,ADAPTIVE TESTING TECHNOLOGIES,R44,2020,752198,0.12740217908238702
"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy.

"MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide Project Summary  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents. In addition to deaths, 16% of adolescents report seriously considering suicide each year, and 8% make one or more attempts. Despite these alarming statistics, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. Thus, developing effective methods to improve short-term prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is critical.  Currently, our most robust predictors of STBs are demographic or clinical indicators that have relatively weak predictive value. However, there is an emerging literature on short-term prediction of suicide risk that has identified a number of promising candidates, including rapid escalation of: (a) emotional distress, (b) social dysfunction (i.e., bullying, rejection), and (c) sleep disturbance. Yet, prior studies are limited in two critical ways. First, they rely almost entirely on self-report. Second, most studies have not focused on assessment of these risk factors using intensive longitudinal assessment techniques that are able to capture the dynamics of changes in risk states. These are fundamental limitations. While suicidal ideation may precede an attempt by years, socio-emotional changes preceding a suicide attempt often occurs within the time span of minutes to hours. This study will capitalize on recent developments in real-time monitoring methods that harness adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology. Specifically, we now have the capacity to use: (a) smartphone technology to conduct intensive longitudinal assessments monitoring putative risk factors with minimal participant burden and (b) modern computational techniques to develop predictive algorithms for STBs.  The project will include high-risk adolescents (n = 200) aged 13-18 years recruited from outpatient and inpatient clinics: (a) recent suicide attempters with current ideation (n = 70), (b) current suicide ideators with no attempt history (n = 70), and (c) a psychiatric control group with no STB history (n = 60). Effortless Assessment of Risk States (EARS) will be used to continuously measure variables relevant to key risk domains—emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—through passive monitoring of participants' smartphone use. First, we will test between-group differences in risk factors during an initial 2-week period, and determine the extent to which risk factors derived from mobile phones improves discrimination over self-reported indicators. Second, we will use statistical techniques to test whether the risk factors improve short-term prediction of STBs (e.g., suicide attempts, hospitalization) during the 6-month follow-up period above and beyond clinical assessments. Third, computational machine learning techniques—based on a priori and learned features—will develop predictive models that utilize the full range of intensive longitudinal data collected by the active and passive monitoring methods to predict group membership and STB outcomes. Ultimately, by leveraging smartphone technology, we aim to improve the short-term STB prediction and provide clinicians and patients with reliable, scalable and actionable tools that will reduce the needless loss of life. Project Narrative Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and despite this pressing public health crisis, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. However, recent advancements in mobile technologies afford the capacity to monitor known risk factors—including emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—which has the potential to revolutionize our insight and clinical management of short- term risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, the present study will leverage adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology, along with advanced signal processing and computational modeling approaches, to identify promising short-term predictors of suicide among high-risk adolescents, which ultimately, may reduce needless loss of life.",MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide,9982129,U01MH116923,"['Academic

"Digital Monitoring of Agitation for Short-Term Suicide Risk Prediction Suicide is a prevalent and burdensome public health problem that warrants immediate attention. As the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, suicide claims the lives of more than 44,000 Americans each year. There is an urgent need to identify objective and clinically informative markers of imminent risk for suicidal behavior. Agitation, defined in DSM-5 as excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension, is listed as a warning sign for suicide by leading organizations and in widely used risk assessment protocols. Yet, prior research on the association between agitation and suicide has key methodological limitations (including related to the operationalization of agitation), which has resulted in minimal empirical evidence to support agitation as a proximal risk factor for suicide. Addressing this gap in knowledge has the potential for significant impact, including informing both the clinical assessment of suicide risk and the development of just-in-time interventions for detecting and responding to acute suicide risk. This project will overcome the limitations of prior suicide risk factor research by assessing multiple behavioral (motor activity and vocal features [e.g., volume, speaking rate, pitch]) and subjective components of agitation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a sample at elevated risk for suicide over a short, high-risk period. We will test the hypotheses that (1) objectively measured real-time indicators of agitation correlate with both momentary subjective ratings and validated, gold standard measures of agitation, and (2) both subjective and objective indicators of agitation improve prediction of short-term increases in suicide ideation, plan, and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. We propose to collect high-resolution self-report (e.g., ecological momentary assessment) and passive (e.g., accelerometer) data on agitation using smartphones and wearable sensors from psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicide ideation or attempt during inpatient treatment and the four weeks after discharge. Multi- level modeling and machine learning approaches will be implemented to examine (1) associations between objective and subjective real-time indicators of agitation and validated measures of agitation, and (2) the degree to which real-time indicators of agitation predict momentary fluctuations in suicidal ideation and suicide plan and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. The scientific aims of this study map onto the candidate’s training in three primary areas: (1) digital monitoring of high-risk patients, (2) advanced longitudinal multivariate data analysis, and (3) identification of behavioral and vocal biomarkers. The candidate’s training plan includes mentorship from Dr. Matthew Nock (primary mentor), Dr. Jordan Smoller (co- mentor), Dr. Maurizio Fava (co-mentor), and Drs. Rosalind Picard, Evan Kleiman, and Thomas Quatieri (consultants), as well as quantitative coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This mentored five-year award will propel the candidate to an independent patient- oriented research career focused on using scalable methods to advance suicide prediction and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE To make an impact on the rising rates of suicide, we must improve the ability to predict when and for whom suicidal behavior will occur. This project overcomes the methodological limitations of prior studies of risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors by studying a promising and clinically informative proximal risk factor for suicide (agitation) using mobile devices that provide high-resolution objective and subjective data, a high-risk sample (psychiatric inpatients), and a short period of high suicide risk (immediately following hospital discharge), and in combination with other distal and proximal risk factors. Findings will inform short-term suicide risk prediction and the development of novel just-in-time interventions for individuals at high risk of suicide.",Digital Monitoring of Agitation for Short-Term Suicide Risk Prediction,9981035,K23MH120436,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institutes ', ' Jordan ', ' Maps ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Motor Activity ', ' Locomotor Activity ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Restlessness ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Left ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' diaries ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' suicidal ', ' Hour ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' American ', ' Manuscripts ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' DSM-5 ', ' DSM5 ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' DSM-V ', ' K12 ', ' SECTM1 ', ' Secreted and Transmembrane 1 ', ' SECTM1 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Research Training ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' digital ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' Guide prevention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' standard measure ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' accelerometry ', ' activity monitor ', ' activity tracker ', ' Accelerometer ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2020,198877,0.14805622633987164
"Deciphering the role of neuronal and peripheral DNA methylation in suicide and bipolar disorder Project Summary/Abstract Prevention of suicidal behavior, especially among patients with mood disorders, is of uttermost importance among mental health professionals. Patients with bipolar disorder (BD), which affects around 1-2% of the population, are at a particularly high risk for developing suicidal behavior, with 25-50% of patients making at least one suicide attempt in their lifetime. In addition, although there is evidence that BD and suicide share a genetic risk and that stress may play a key role in suicidality, the mechanisms by which some patients are more vulnerable to suicidal behavior than others are vastly unknown. Guided by strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, may underlie suicide risk among BD patients. Moreover, DNA methylation markers may provide clinically-relevant biomarkers for the identification of patients at highest risk for suicidal behavior. These hypotheses will be tested by completing three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize DNA methylation alterations with the latest-generation Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip 850K platform in a discovery sample of neurons isolated from post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues from patients with BD that committed suicide or died of other causes and controls. Promising markers will be validated by oxidative bisulfite pyrosequencing and further explored by pathway analyses. In Aim 2, we will investigate the coordinated changes between genetic risk for BD and suicide attempt and DNA methylation alterations in post-mortem prefrontal cortex using the same cohort as Aim 1 and a replication cohort from the UTHealth Brain Collection for Research in Psychiatric Disorders. In Aim 3, we will analyze the clinical correlates of methylome markers of suicide in an independent cohort of adult patients with BD that have previously attempted to commit suicide or not, compared to healthy controls, from which a comprehensive dataset with demographic, clinical, and neuroanatomical data is available, as well as genome-wide methylation and genotyping data. Specific targets and pathways predicting suicidal behavior will be further explored by sophisticated statistics and bioinformatics tools while controlling for co-variables known to associate with suicidal risk, followed by the development of machine learning algorithms for the prediction of suicidality at the individual level. Of note, the overarching goal of this K01 is to further the PI’s expertise in the biology and clinical aspects of suicide, bioinformatics, post-mortem analyses, and epigenomics, which will ensure a methodologically strong foundation to launch an independent lab in psychiatric epigenetics. Importantly, a strong group of mentors and collaborators with a remarkable track record in training junior faculty has been selected to provide intellectual and technical input during the award period. In addition, the outstanding resources, facilities, and multidisciplinary scientific community at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and the Texas Medical Center represent an ideal environment to ensure that the PI accomplishes his research and career objectives. This proposal is well aligned with the mission of the NIMH, and it will not only provide the PI with crucial training required to his transition to full independence, but also address important, testable questions regarding the poorly understood risk for suicide among BD patients and the lack of specific tools for the identification of vulnerable subjects. Project Narrative Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder significantly increasing its risk possibly due to a shared genetic and epigenetic risk. However, there are no clinically-useful biomarkers available for the prediction of suicidality in patients and very little is known about the molecular mechanisms of suicide in this disorder, which limits our ability to provide targeted prophylactic interventions for susceptible subjects. Here we propose to conduct a multidisciplinary translational study to identify a clinically-relevant DNA methylation biosignature to predict suicidal behavior in bipolar disorder patients and its association with clinical and neuroanatomical parameters.",Deciphering the role of neuronal and peripheral DNA methylation in suicide and bipolar disorder,10055559,K01MH121580,"['psychological disorder ', ' Biology ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Faculty ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Foundations ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Masks ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' bisulfite ', ' hydrogen sulfite ', ' hydrosulfite ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' career ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' prophylactic ', ' cell type ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Medical center ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Early identification ', ' commit suicide ', ' completed suicide ', ' accomplished suicide ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' pyrosequencing ', ' epigenomics ', ' Population ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' translational study ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' high risk ', ' biosignature ', ' genomewide methylation ', ' global methylation ', ' genome wide methylation ', ' methylome ', ' methylation marker ', ' methylation biomarker ', ' BeadChip ', ' bead chip ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' marker identification ', ' biomarker identification ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' methylomics ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Award ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,K01,2020,174843,0.08871466157541215
"Built Environment Assessment through Computer visiON (BEACON): Applying Deep Learning to Street-Level and Satellite Images to Estimate Built Environment Effects on Cardiovascular Health PROJECT SUMMARY Over 80% of the US population resides in urban areas, and the built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may drive cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain, and by influencing exposures to environmental factors, such as air pollution, extreme temperatures, and noise. Evidence for the built environment and CVD has been dominated by cross-sectional studies with nonspecific exposure assessment. Developing precise, time-varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to establish causal relationships between the built environment and CVD, which are crucial to informing policy-relevant, actionable interventions. It is now possible to estimate such exposure metrics at scale in prospective cohort studies using deep learning computer vision methods, a class of machine learning algorithms that can accurately process images, combined with time-varying nationwide street-level imagery, high resolution satellite data, and novel mobile health technologies. We propose to identify the influence of the built environment on CVD health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing built environment exposure measures from deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data in participants with global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (N=500), and to geocoded residential addresses from nationwide Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study prospective cohorts (N=288,000). We will create built environment exposure measures by leveraging deep learning algorithms applied to nationwide Google Street View imagery (2007-2020) and high-resolution Landsat satellite data (1986-2020) to create fine-scale, time-varying built environment metrics of the natural environment (e.g., trees), physical environment (e.g., sidewalks), perceptions (e.g., safety), and urban form (e.g., compact high-rise). We will use a mix of innovative analytical approaches to determine the effect of the built environment on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence across different time horizons. First, we will append these metrics to time-activity patterns of participants who have collected minute-level data on GPS and physical activity from smartphones and consumer wearable devices to quantify how minute-level exposure to the built environment is related to CVD health behaviors. Next, we will apply novel built environment metrics to residential address histories of participants to estimate how self-reported CVD health behaviors change after their residential built environment changes. Last, we will examine the association between long-term cumulative residential exposure to the built environment and CVD incidence over 34 years of follow-up. Our work will enable us to measure built environment exposure from unprecedented perspectives in large prospective cohorts, to elucidate potential causal relationships between the built environment and CVD health behaviors, and to better specify pathways to CVD incidence. Ultimately, our work will yield actionable insights to guide land use policy and urban planning strategies to design cities that optimize cardiovascular health.

"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"Environment, Metabolomics, and PD Project Abstract Our PEG study is among the largest Parkinson's disease (PD) population-based study with exceptional high-quality disease characterization and in-depth exposure assessment. Patients are diagnosed and examined (multiple times) by a UCLA movement disorder specialist. We developed a longitudinal geographic information system (GIS) based assessment for pesticide exposures that links state-mandated information on type, date, and location of all agricultural pesticide applications in California recorded since 1974 to land use maps and study participants' residences and work places. Here we propose to combine a powerful new metabolomics tool and system biology analytic methods to identify signatures for toxic exposures that evoke long-term biologic responses. The metabolomics data we will generate will help us identify metabolic profiles for chronic environmental exposures for both PD patients and population controls. This will generate a first understanding of the metabolic consequences of chronic low dose pesticide exposure in PD. However, biologic processes, including biologic responses to chronic toxicant exposures and those involved in disease development, are highly dynamic and interactive systems. The PEG study is uniquely capable to begin investigating these multidimensional networks linking exposure and disease. We have already generated genome and epigenome profiles for 550 PD patients and 250 controls. Here we newly propose to generate and analyze serum based metabolome profiles (targeted and untargeted) for these same 800 study participants characterizing environmental pesticide exposures via metabolome wide association analyses. We aim to develop a metabolite signature of environmental exposure using supervised machine learning methods, and also determine if these are disease specific or found in both exposed cases and controls. Furthermore, incorporating our genome and epigenome information, we propose to use biological systems analysis to identify multi-omics network patterns that distinguish environmental exposures that contribute to PD onset and progression. We expect this to show a chronic response pattern across different molecular layers and are influenced by many environmental factors. Combining multi-omic measures based on multidimensional network and system analyses will address the gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD. Project Narrative Here we propose to build upon a unique resource - the PEG population-based Parkinson's disease (PD) study - to identify metabolic signatures of chronic environmental exposures and disease in 550 PD patients and 250 population controls. Importantly, we plan to integrate exposure and effect markers across multiple molecular layers (genome, epigenome, metabolome), with the goal to obtain a more holistic understanding of molecular changes due to chronic environmental exposures. Our approach incorporates multi-omics measures and multidimensional network and system analyses to address gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD.","Environment, Metabolomics, and PD",9858332,R21ES030175,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Anions ', ' Archives ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', '

"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed. We propose studies using computational methods to determine how antibody decay data may help us estimate cholera exposure incidence.",Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data,9912094,R01AI135115,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Antibodies ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cholera ', ' Cholera Vaccine ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diarrhea ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Haiti ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Household ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Joints ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sanitation ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Vibrio cholerae ', ' V cholerae ', ' V. cholerae ', ' Vibrio comma ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Caring ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Lateral ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Serologic ', ' Serological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Logistics ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Spottings ', ' Genetic ', ' V cholerae O1 ', ' V cholerae Serogroup O1 ', ' V. cholerae O1 ', ' V. cholerae Serogroup O1 ', ' Vibrio cholerae Serogroup O1 ', ' Vibrio cholerae O1 ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' fighting ', ' Oral ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Surveillance Methods ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunologics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' Antibody Response ', ' Haitian ', ' Bangladeshi ', ' Infection with V cholerae ', ' Infection with V. cholerae ', ' Infection with Vibrio cholerae ', ' V cholerae infection ', ' V. cholerae infection ', ' cholera infection ', ' infected with cholera ', ' infection with cholera ', ' Vibrio cholerae infection ', ' Disease Surveillance ', ' Infrastructure ', ' diarrheal illness ', ' diarrheal disease ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,667663,0.1006323199366783
"Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of chronic optic neuropathy and a major source of ocular morbidity worldwide. Understanding preclinical events, early phase disease and disease heterogeneity represent key objectives in early disease detection, prevention and treatment of POAG. In this study, we propose 4 specific aims. 1) We will perform both targeted and untargeted metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) for POAG using pre-clinical serum from a large case-control group (500 cases and 500 controls) nested within ongoing prospective studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS2, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) to advance our understanding of the biochemical events that precede POAG diagnosis (blood was collected ~ 10 years prior to disease diagnosis). Prior studies suggest that nitric oxide metabolites represent genetically informed markers and will form the basis for targeted profiling. 2) While considerable discoveries have been made of POAG genes, more work is needed to leverage genome-wide information to inform POAG etiology. Thus, we will create a genome-wide genetic correlation matrix between POAG and complex traits previously linked to POAG, using data from the NEIGHBORHOOD (National Eye Institute Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration Heritable Overall Operational Database; 3800 POAG cases) consortium and publicly available summary genome-wide association study data. An assessment of the shared heritability between POAG and these traits as well as the relation between the genetic risk scores for these traits and POAG will lead to new etiologic insights. 3) New-onset POAG is clinically heterogeneous with variable visual field (VF) loss patterns that may reflect different etiologies. We will apply archetype analysis, which objectively quantifies a patient's VF loss pattern to 16 existing clinically validated archetypes (ATs), 9 of which are glaucomatous in nature. Each POAG case (n=1250 from NHS, NHS2 and HPFS) and10 matched controls will be assigned 16 weighted coefficients that add up to 1, with each value representing how consistent his / her VF loss pattern is with each glaucomatous AT. We will evaluate the differential relation between established POAG risk factors and the values on the 16 ATs, to identify unique risk factors for homogeneous incident POAG subtypes. 4) A carbohydrate-restricted diet may meet the energy requirement in the non-myelinated retinal ganglion cell axon segment of the optic nerve and reduce risk of POAG. We will conduct a prospective evaluation of this exposure in relation to POAG and POAG subtypes in the 3 cohorts (n=2100 cases). By integrating MWAS, genomics with prospective environmental exposure data and AT analysis, this proposal addresses a number of important knowledge gaps—in particular, it will shed light on how genetic and pre-diagnostic risk factors influence POAG and POAG heterogeneity. Linking specific exposures with POAG subtypes will provide important mechanistic understanding as well as evidence of causality, which will contribute to discovering precision medicine approaches for this condition. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure-related chronic optic nerve disease that produces characteristic visual loss patterns. In this proposal we will study a host of genes, plasma metabolites and environmental factors in relation to POAG overall as well as it's objectively determined subtypes based on visual loss pattern. Understanding how these various exposures relate to POAG and it's subtypes will highlight disease prevention strategies and precision medical treatment options for this potentially blinding disease that requires lifetime management.",Gene-Environment Interactions in Glaucoma,9933925,R01EY015473,"['Acetyl Coenzyme A ', ' Acetyl CoA ', ' S-acetate Coenzyme A ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Archives ', ' Arginine ', ' L-Arginine ', ' Axon ', ' Biogenesis ', ' Origin of Life ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Citrulline ', ' Control Groups ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Genes ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Physiologic Intraocular Pressure ', ' Intraocular Pressure ', ' Ocular Tension ', ' intra-ocular pressure ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Morbidity -

"Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Environmental exposure mixtures, especially when coupled with social stressors, have the potential to compromise developmental outcomes in children, but have been understudied. We will use a unique longitudinal dataset that tracks children from birth through early elementary school, in combination with new tools from modern data science, to disentangle the complex effects of these mixtures on educational outcomes.",Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures,9882999,R01ES028819,"['Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Birth Records ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Carbon Monoxide ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Cox Models ', ' Crime ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Geography ', ' Housing ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Mothers ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nitrogen Dioxide ', ' Nitrogen Peroxide ', ' North Carolina ', ' Ozone ', ' Particle Size ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Siblings ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Sulfur Dioxide ', ' Sulfurous Anhydride ', ' Taxes ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' jobless ', ' joblessness ', ' out of work ', ' unemployed ', ' Work ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' grade school ', ' elementary school ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' pollutant ', ' simulation ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' social stress ', ' deprivation ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' exposed to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposure to lead ', ' lead exposed ', ' lead exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Gaussian statistics ', ' Gaussianity ', ' Gaussianity model ', ' Gaussian model ', ' Data Science ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' data resource ', ' rural environment ', ' Child Health ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' machine learning method ', ' social stressor ', ' ']",NIEHS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,1,0.07283575399420043
"Role of the gut microbiome in pesticide-induced effects on child neurodevelopment SUMMARY Pesticides are pervasive in our environment, and have accumulated in drinking water reserves serving millions of people worldwide, causing growing concern since the potential adverse health effects are not fully understood. In 2017 alone, the world used about 6.8 million tons of pesticides, of which the world's largest usage is in China and the United States. More recently it has been discovered that pesticides have strong effects on microbial communities, extinguishing entire clades while promoting growth in others. Shifts in microbial composition have been associated with brain development, mood and behavior suggesting a strong link between the gut and the brain. We hypothesize that there may exist an unappreciated microbiome component to the adverse health effects of pesticide exposure. In this proposal, we will use a comprehensive approach to identify the microbial components of pesticide susceptibility to neurodevelopmental delay. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to 11 targeted pesticides on child neurodevelopment in a large well-defined human Mother and Child Microbiome Cohort (MCMC) consisting of 3000 mother and child pairs. Study participants are currently followed up regularly until the children reach 4 years of age. Comprehensive artificial intelligence analysis of pesticide exposure and children's early neurodevelopment data will identify key pesticides that negatively impact child development. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that prenatal exposure to pesticides can shift the composition of the GM and subsequently lead to abnormal neurodevelopment. We will integrate the child gut microbiome data with maternal pesticide exposure during pregnancy and child neurodevelopment data to investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to targeted pesticides on child gut microbiome and development. This Aim will identify specific gut bacteria or clades associated with child neurodevelopment. In Aim 3, we will use conventional and germ-free mouse models to elucidate mechanisms by which pesticide exposure can affect the gut microbiome and behavior. Conventionally housed pregnant mice will be exposed to pesticides and the gut microbiome and behavior (anxiety, memory, motor performance, social interaction) will be analyzed in their offspring. Also, germ-free mice will be colonized with specific bacteria or bacterial clades to study the causality of the impact of the GM on behavior. The long-term implications for human health are significant – it may be possible to increase tolerance/robustness to pesticide exposure by providing sensitive individuals with probiotics that have select degradation pathways. Moreover, this understanding is important in order to formulate novel preventive strategies including educating health practitioners, families, and public health providers and organizations regarding the potential risks of environmental exposures. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chemical and toxic substances, such as herbicides and pesticides pose some of the most common threats to environmental and human health. Our studies are designed to identify effects of prenatal pesticide exposure on child neurodevelopment and the role of the gut microbiome in mediating pesticide-induced adverse health effects.

"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,9928464,R01ES030302,"['Accounting ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arsenic ', ' Atlases ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Blood -

"Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology OVERALL : ABSTRACT This is the third competing continuation for an accomplished Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHS CC), The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The Director is Trevor M. Penning, PhD (The Thelma Brown and Henry Charles Molinoff Professor of Pharmacology) and the Deputy Director is Rebecca A. Simmons, MD (The Hallam Hurt Endowed Professor in Pediatrics). The Center is comprised of 71 members from 18 Departments and 5 Schools, with almost equal representation of basic and clinician-scientists drawn from the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The CEET has built an institutional, regional and national identity in environmental health sciences (EHS) in the absence of a School of Public Health and Department of EHS at Penn. The synergistic combination of basic and clinician-scientists within the CEET promotes translational environmental health research that addresses fundamental questions and translates knowledge into action to have a major impact on human health and disease consistent with the NIEHS Strategic Plan. The CEET mission is to “elucidate the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and human disease, and translate findings into action to improve the health of vulnerable individuals, and local, national, and global communities”. This mission is accomplished through five aims. In Aim 1: We use a flexible thematic area structure to conduct translational environmental health research to improve precision public health. Our current themes are in Air Pollution & Lung Health; Environmental Exposures & Cancer; Windows-of- Susceptibility; and Environmental Neuroscience. Each thematic area integrates the pillars or exposure science, adverse outcome constructs (pathways and networks) to explain the phenome with translation to communities and human subjects. In Aim 2: We conduct bi-directional communication with communities in S.E and N.E. Pennsylvania and use community engagement to set the research agenda for the CEET. In Aim 3: We provide a facility core structure to promote precision public health. Our Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core is adept in human subject study design and in conducting population exposure services, using cartographic modeling, GIS tools and biosensors. Biomarkers of exposure and effect are measured in our Translational Biomarker Core which conducts mass spectrometric assays at a level of precision and accuracy difficult to emulate elsewhere. The Exposure Biology Informatics Core brings to bear the power of computation, machine learning and AI to predict the toxicity of unknowns and integrate Big-data sets to recognize patterns in “omics” data and predict adverse outcomes. In Aim 4: We build capacity in environmental health sciences by funding pilot projects to Early Stage Investigators (ESI) and to senior investigators conducting environmental health research for the first time. In Aim 5: We cultivate the careers of ESI through a transformative Environmental Health Scientist Support Program that provides mentoring, grant proposal review, environmental health and Facility Core workshops. OVERALL : NARRATIVE The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) conducts research that links environmental exposures, to adverse outcomes and translates its findings to human subjects and communities to identify the most vulnerable and improve prevention, intervention and treatment through precision public health.

"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,10238415,R00ES028743,"['Odds Ratio ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Parents ', ' Pesticides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Environmental Wind ', ' Wind ', ' cypermethrin ', ' supercypermethrin ', ' supermethrin ', ' Permethrin ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' excretion ', ' Excretory function ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Ingestion ', ' Measurement ', ' Spottings ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Performance ', ' pyrethroid ', ' early childhood ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' exposed in utero ', ' fetal exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' case control ', ' Melissa ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' urinary ', ' pesticide exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' toxic exposure ', ' Toxicant exposure ', ' public health relevance ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Learning Skill ', ' study population ', ' agricultural pesticide ', ' phenotyping algorithm ', ' Acids ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Arizona ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Birth Certificates ', ' California ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Chlorpyrifos ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Humidity ', ' indexing ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicaid ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Mentors ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Methods ', ' ']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R00,2020,248998,0.1274322436455595
"Suicide Prediction and Prevention for People at Risk for Opioid Use Disorder Title: Reducing Stigma toward People with Opioid Use Disorder among Primary Care Clinicians Abstract: This study integrates the Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) suicide risk models into Opioid Wizard, an electronic health record (EHR) clinical decision support (CDS) to identify and treat patients at high risk of or identified with opioid use disorder (OUD) or overdose. In both intervention and control clinics, suicide risk scores will be calculated for all Opioid Wizard-eligible patients and relevant EHR data to inform analyses will be archived. In intervention clinics, Opioid Wizard will alert primary care clinicians (PCCs) to Opioid Wizard-eligible patients who are at increased risk of suicide and coach them through use of the Columbia Suicide Severity Risk Scale (CSSRS), a structured tool in the EHR that will help PCCs assess immediate suicide risk. Based on the resulting CSSRS score, Opioid Wizard will provide EHR links for risk-based referrals and follow-up recommendations, including care as usual, safety plan completion, routine or emergent referral to behavioral health, or transportation to the emergency department (ED) for further assessment. Primary outcome measures include completion of CSSRS assessments for at-risk patients and patient engagement in outpatient mental health care.     Modified Specific Aims Section Aim 1. Evaluate the impact of Opioid Wizard + Suicide Risk Prediction on suicide assessment process measures.  H1: Opioid Wizard-eligible patients (patients with OUD or at elevated risk of OUD/overdose) with elevated suicide risk in intervention clinics will have higher rates of completed CSSRS assessments than similar patients in control clinics.    Aim 2. Examine the impact of Opioid Wizard + Suicide Risk Prediction on patient engagement in mental health care.  H2: Opioid Wizard-eligible patients with elevated suicide risk in intervention clinics will have higher rates of engagement in their outpatient mental health care than similar patients in control clinics. Modified Public Health Relevance Section Two public health issues of paramount importance -- suicide and opioid overdose -- have substantial overlap. Depression and other mental health conditions increase the risk of both opioid use disorder (OUD) and suicide, and people with OUD are more likely to have depression and other mental health conditions. In fact, the risk of both suicide and opioid overdose is likely highest in those with both OUD and mental health diagnoses. More than 48,000 people died of suicide and 46,000 of an opioid overdose in the US in 2018, and over 40% of suicide and overdose deaths involved opioids. Ultimately, people with OUD are 13 times more likely to die by suicide than the general population.     OUD and opioid misuse are associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, but distinguishing intentional and unintentional overdoses is complicated. The proportion of opioid-overdose deaths that are suicides is likely considerable and underestimated, as it is challenging to classify overdoses according to intent. Furthermore, intentionality of overdose is likely dimensional, rather than categorical, with many overdoses not fully intentional or unintentional. Suicide deaths and overdose deaths share common risk factors, and while historically most overdoses have been thought to be unintentional, more recent evidence suggests that a significant proportion – estimated to be 20 to 30% - are intentional.    The US Preventative Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to support universal screening for suicide risk, but this is not to discourage screening at-risk populations, such as people with or at high risk for OUD or opioid overdose. A recent commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine states that improved screening for suicide risk along with rapid access to treatment is critical to prevent opioid-related suicide deaths in patients with OUD. Ultimately, people with OUD should be targeted for prevention of both suicide and opioid overdose, recognizing that mental health conditions in this population will further increase risk. To that end, this ancillary study, which will help primary care clinicians (PCCs) both identify people at risk for OUD/opioid overdose and a subset at increased risk of suicide, is particularly timely and important. In addition to guiding PCCs through structured assessment of suicide risk and providing decision support for recognition and treatment of depression, our study’s potential to improve access to medications for OUD is also thought to reduce rates of intentional (and unintentional) overdose.",Suicide Prediction and Prevention for People at Risk for Opioid Use

"Improving the Identification and Management of Suicide Risk among Patients Using Prescription Opioids ABSTRACT The opioid epidemic in the US, coupled with emerging data on the association between opioid use and suicidal behavior, highlights the urgent need for research that identifies patients at greatest risk and provides strategies to mitigate this risk. However, the development of risk algorithms that provide clinical guidance for providers with patients using opioids who may have underlying mental disorders or comorbid diagnoses has been nonexistent. Recent work has demonstrated the compelling need for a better understanding of, and clinical decision support tools to address, suicide risk among prescription opioid drug users. The proposed study provides an opportunity to address gaps in both the identification and clinical management of suicide risk in patients using prescription opioids. We propose to use transfer learning approaches to identify the clinical and demographic characteristics associated with elevated risk of suicidal behavior among prescription opioid users; to develop clinical phenotypes of patients with higher risk of suicidal behavior associated with prescription opioids, and to incorporate these phenotypes in a clinical decision support platform that can be used for identification and intervention at the point of care; and to conduct a pilot study implementing and evaluating the impact of the clinical decision support platform in the existing clinical workflow in 3 diverse clinical settings. Our approach is specifically designed to address the incomplete picture of patient risk in existing models due to the fragmentation of clinical care across settings. We do this by developing algorithms that can statistically “borrow” information from more comprehensive patient datasets and apply it to more limited datasets in a particular healthcare setting. The proposed work will draw on comprehensive clinical data from a mature health information exchange containing more than 2.3 million patients across the spectrum of clinical care to develop a statistically robust method to measure suicide risk associated with prescription opioid use. The clinical decision support tool developed under this proposal will provide a generalizable platform that could be extended to other opioid related risks, e.g., OUD and overdose. The potential public health significance of this study is substantial. The fragmentation of the healthcare system, particularly in relation to patients' behavioral health needs, highlights the critical need to cultivate comprehensive, system-wide approaches to identifying and managing at patients using prescription opioids who are at risk of suicide. Narrative Suicide and prescription opioid use are two of the most serious public health problems facing the United States. The proposed project will demonstrate an innovative method for identifying patients using prescription opioids who are at risk of suicidal behavior.",Improving the Identification and Management of Suicide Risk among Patients Using Prescription Opioids,10155895,R01MH112148,"['Algorithms ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Methods ', ' Morphine ', ' Infumorph ', ' Kadian ', ' MS Contin ', ' MSir ', ' Morphia ', ' Oramorph ', ' Oramorph SR ', ' Roxanol ', ' Statex SR ', ' Overdose ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Time ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' chronic pain ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' suicidal ', ' milligram ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' clinical practice ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' prescription opioid ', ' urgent care ', ' Patient risk ', ' support tools ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid use ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Opiate user ', ' Opioid drug user ', ' PWUO ', ' patients who use opioids ', ' people who use opioids ', ' persons who use opioids ', ' opioid user ', ' data fusion ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R01,2020,853369,0.09850285788570966
"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of

"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes. This project aims to improve exposure therapy response for patients with social anxiety disorder by directly linking exposure therapy response to the neurobiology of extinction learning.",Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory,9904774,K23MH113708,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Animals ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Extinction (Psychology) ', ' Extinction ', ' behavioral extinction ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' skin conductance ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Loudness ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' learning extinction ', ' Funding ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' American ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' K23 Award ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Program ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' individualized medicine ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive marker ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' social anxiety ', ' Social Anxiety Disorder ', ' treatment of anxiety disorders ', ' anxious individuals ', ' anxious ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' improved outcome ', ' recruit ', ' patient specific response ', ' responsive patient ', ' patient response ', ' ']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,186408,0.09243850511789957
"Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction ABSTRACT In the next 60 minutes, at least 57 people in the United States (US) will attempt to kill themselves, and five will die. Over 80% of these individuals encountered a healthcare provider in the 12 months before his or her death, but their risk will have gone undetected or, if detected, poorly quantified and not sufficiently monitored longitudinally. The proposed research will address this deficit by building and validating the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale -- Expanded (CAT-SS EXPANDED), software that can screen for, quantify, and monitor suicide risk in a way far superior to existing instruments. It will enable at least three key Zero Suicide performance elements, including systematic, standardized frontline suicide risk screening and measurement (Identify), tracking and communicating risk across locations of care (Transitions), and monitoring changes in patient outcomes resulting from continuous quality improvement activities (Improve). In a paradigm shifting innovation, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will not only comprise the first multi-dimensional CAT of its kind, it will import suicide risk indicators that have already been validated by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) directly from a health system’s electronic health record (EHR). This SBIR Fast Track has two phases. Phase 1 will build the CAT-SS EXPANDED, starting with well-established preliminary work and using iterative user testing with 20 clinician-patient dyads to refine the features. Phase 2 will have two Aims. The first Aim will validate the CAT-SS EXPANDED against an independent research clinician’s suicide risk stratification and suicidal behavior 24 weeks after the index visit (n=700). The second Aim will complete two-way integration of the validated CAT-SS EXPANDED into UMass’ EHR production environment and will evaluate clinical usability and acceptability with a new sample of ~30 suicide-risk enriched patients. Innovation and Impact: While traditional suicide screening tools exist, they are very limited, a conclusion supported by systematic reviews, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, and the NIMH. Because of these limitations, strong, well-validated clinical decision support to guide appropriate levels of care do not exist, reinforcing non-standardized and inefficient workflow, such as a tendency to conservatively order unnecessary emergency psychiatric evaluations. The CAT-SS EXPANDED will address these well-known measurement limitations using cutting edge strategies embodied in multi-dimensional CAT and EHR-derived risk indicators, an unprecedented capability impossible to achieve with existing measures. While this study focuses on the ED as a starting point because of its well-known risk burden and emerging literature supporting the value of universal suicide risk screening combined with brief interventions, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will be specifically designed and later tested as the first approach to suicide risk monitoring suitable for enterprise deployment across settings and locations of care, which is transformational for suicide prevention and fundamental to the Zero Suicide model’s emphasis on holistic system change. NARRATIVE  Having a psychometrically valid suicide risk instrument that efficiently screens for risk, provides risk stratification, and can be used across settings and easily integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) has tremendous potential to enable the enterprise implementation of the Zero Suicide model across an entire healthcare system, regardless of location of care. Because the software we will create and validate, the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale – Expanded, blends computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and EHR suicide risk indicators previously validated using advanced analytic approaches by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network, it is markedly different from existing instruments, which focus on a specific setting or patient population, rely on obsolete administration and psychometric methods, contain only screening capability with no monitoring components, and are not EHR-integrated in such a way as to tap into the data stored in the EHRs. This SBIR Fast Track proposal is necessary to keep pace with the burgeoning adoption of electronic patient reported outcomes and EHRs across healthcare and is foundational to the next step of designing better suicide interventions.",Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction,9985286,R44MH118780,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Tests ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Standardization ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Schedule ', ' Blinded ', ' Caring ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' Equation ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' professor ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Intake ', ' Research Training ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' point of care ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' systematic review ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' suicide model ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' patient population ', ' secondary outcome ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' screening ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' data visualization ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Self-Direction ', ' substance misuse ', ' Risk stratification ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' clinical decision support ', ' risk prediction model ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NIMH,ADAPTIVE TESTING TECHNOLOGIES,R44,2020,97195,0.12740217908238702
"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9999949,R00ES027022,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cognition ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Monitoring ', ' Ecologic Monitoring ', ' Ecological Monitoring ', ' environmental testing ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' New York City ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rotation ', ' Schools ', ' Selection Bias ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Urban Population ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Distal ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Development Plans ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' experience ', ' pollutant ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' skills ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' 3rd grade ', ' third grade ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' exposed in utero ', ' fetal exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Cognitive ', ' Ontology ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epidemiological model ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' early life exposure ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' health data ', ' Data Science ', ' urban children ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Child Health ', ' random forest ', ' multiple data types ', ' adverse birth outcomes ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' big-data science ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2020,247463,0.13313316656714494
"Predicting suicide attempt in youth by integrating EHR, clinical, cognitive and imaging data Summary. Suicide in youths is a growing health concern, yet current clinical practice falls short of timely identifying youths at risk for suicide attempt (SA). The overarching aim of this research is to use data driven machine learning methods to facilitate primary prevention of youth SAs in primary care pediatric settings. Clinical guidelines recommend screening for depression, considered a proxy for suicide risk, from age 12 in pediatric setting. The proposed study aims at identification of variables (features) that can be collected by early adolescence, and contribute to prediction of SA in later adolescence. This study will leverage the effort that has been invested in previous projects: a study using electronic health records (EHR) to predict SAs and deaths in University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) hospitals; and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), that included comprehensive phenotyping of ~9,500 youths. These previous efforts will be integrated to develop and optimize SA prediction in youth from the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) network, from which we have data on ~40,000 who were screened for a history of SA between the years 2014-2018 (n~1500). First, in the CHOP dataset, we will generate predictive models based on UPMC data, test their predictive validity in CHOP youth population, and then develop, optimize, and cross validate these predictive models using CHOP EHR data as a training set (Aim 1). Second, in the PNC dataset, we will use multiple data types (demographic, behavioral, cognitive, imaging) to classify youths with suicide ideation (SI, n~750) and identify features (potentially modifiable) that are indicative of SI and may also point to potential mechanisms underlying youth SI (Aim 2). Lastly, in a subset of 936 youths (49 with SAs) with both CHOP EHR data and research PNC evaluation that was conducted at mean age 11 (T1), ~5 years before SA screening (T2), we will test the validity of models from Aims 1&2, and aim to identify data features that were collected at T1 and can improve/optimize/outperform the prediction of SAs that relies solely on EHR data (Aim 3). The proposed study relies on the expertise of a highly capable multidisciplinary team comprised of Dr. Barzilay (PI), child- adolescent psychiatrist experienced in suicide research and analysis of suicide related phenotypes in PNC data; Dr. Tsui (PI), an expert in machine learning who has developed predictive algorithms of SA and deaths using UPMC data; and collaborators critical for meeting study aims, Dr. Raquel Gur as the lead researcher who established the PNC, Dr. Ruben Gur who developed the PNC neurocognitive assessment tools, and Dr. Oquendo who will provide expertise in suicide prediction research. The team’s access and familiarity with CHOP EHR and PNC data resources, coupled with its interdisciplinary expertise, creates a unique opportunity to identify childhood features that can optimize later adolescent SA prediction. Expected findings can ultimately translate to real world clinical practice, be integrated in EHR, and help flag youths at risk for a SA in a pediatric setting, allowing timely identification and intervention, contributing to the mission of reducing suicide in youth. Project Narrative Suicide is the second leading cause of death in youth, and a major focus of pediatric and psychiatric research, yet teen suicide rates are on the rise. The proposed research aims to develop novel computational tools that will allow prediction of youth suicide attempts using the individual’s electronic medical record, and help identify which variables (that are currently not part of the medical record) need to be integrated in the medical record of a child in order to optimize such prediction. The findings of this project are expected to translate to clinical practice and help primary care providers timely identify youth at suicide risk and thus contribute to reducing youth suicide rates.","Predicting suicide attempt in youth by integrating EHR, clinical, cognitive and imaging data",10038009,R21MH123916,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', '

"The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence Project Summary Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are the most common types of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in the world. VBD epidemics have been increasing over recent decades, with tickborne diseases having doubled in the last decade in the United States. Despite the increase in public health burden, over 80% of vector-control organizations lack preventative capabilities. Understanding the interplay between the environment, vectors, pathogens, and humans that expedite disease spread remains a challenge. The overarching goal of this project is to identify the key environmental and human drivers that have led to the emergence of VBDs. Current models that predict tickborne disease risk have oversimplified the process by focusing only on the vector, i.e. risk of tick exposure. A human’s risk of infection is not only a function of entomological risk but also of factors inherent to the individual including behavior or characteristics that increase susceptibility to disease. This project proposes a novel approach to tickborne disease prediction by developing a comprehensive model that incorporate pathogen population dynamics and human factors to predict disease risk. This study will investigate several pathogens vectored by the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis): Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic anaplasmosis), and Babesia microti (babesiosis). The central hypothesis is that the prediction of tickborne disease risk can be improved by using sophisticated statistical methods to identify environmental drivers that impact pathogen population dynamics while incorporating human demographic characteristics. The hypothesis will be addressed in the following aims: (1) Determine the current and historical population dynamic patterns of pathogens vectored by I. scapularis to predict pathogen distribution; (2) Determine the association between human characteristics and tick-borne disease risk in order to develop an improved spatial disease risk model. This model will allow the identification and quantification of factors that are associated with the emergence of tickborne diseases in New York State, which is geographically advantageous because it is representative of much of the natural environment that ticks encounter in the northeastern US including rapid and recent changes in climate and landscapes. The results of this project will be used to develop a public disease warning system that will use contemporary and future climate forecasts to monitor tick populations and predict potential disease outbreaks for areas with vulnerable populations. With climate forecasts predicting an increase in 2-3°C in temperature by 2100, there is uncertainty in how diseases will shift and a warning system will allow preparation accordingly. At the completion of the proposed research project, the applicant will have acquired the following skillsets through intensive, interdisciplinary mentorship: big data analysis, advanced statistics including Bayesian and machine learning methods, spatial analyses, and risk analysis. This will enable the applicant to succeed as an independent investigator to address the challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases. Project Narrative Vector-borne diseases are the most common types of emerging infectious diseases in the world and constitute major threats to public health. My project uses advanced statistical methods to uncover how interactions between environmental factors affecting pathogen population dynamics and human demographic characteristics determine human risk for three tick-borne diseases: Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. The results of my project will be used to create a risk map to predict the spatial and temporal occurrence of tickborne diseases, which can inform public health strategies in order to mitigate disease burden.",The Environmental and Human Factors that Determine Ixodes scapularis-borne Diseases Incidence,10018461,F31AI133871,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Babesia microti ', ' Babesiosis ', ' Babesia infection ', ' Babesia parasite infection ', ' Piroplasmosis ', ' infected with Babesia ', ' Behavior ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi ', ' B burgdorferi ', ' B. burgdorferi ', ' Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto ', ' Lyme Disease Spirochete ', ' lyme spirochete ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Entomology ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' granulocyte ', ' Blood granulocytic cell ', ' Granular Leukocytes ', ' Granulocytic cell ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Lyme Disease ', ' Lyme Borreliosis ', ' Maps ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' New York ', ' geographic population ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Temperature ', ' Ticks ', ' Ixodida ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' tickborne infection ', ' Tick-Borne Infections ', ' tick-borne illness ', ' tickborne disease ', ' tickborne illness ', ' Tick-Borne Diseases ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' I scapularis ', ' I. scapularis ', ' Ixodes scapularis ', ' Ixodid ticks ', ' blacklegged tick ', ' Black-legged Tick ', ' A phagocytophila ', ' A phagocytophilum ', ' A. phagocytophila ', ' A. phagocytophilum ', ' Anaplasma phagocytophila ', ' Cytoecetes phagocytophila ', ' Ehrlichia equi ', ' Ehrlichia phagocytophila ', ' HGE Agent ', ' Anaplasma phagocytophilum ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Human Nature ', ' Human Characteristics ', ' Emerging Infectious Diseases ', ' Emerging Communicable Diseases ', ' model design ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Vector-borne disease ', ' Vector-borne infectious disease ', ' Vector-transmitted disease ', ' vector-borne illness ', ' vectorborne disease ', ' vectorborne illness ', ' vectorborne infectious disease ', ' Vector-transmitted infectious disease ', ' environmental change ', ' Ecological Change ', ' vector control ', ' vector ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' pathogen exposure ', ' anthropogenic ', ' anthropogenesis ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' cost effective ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' human disease ', ' vector transmission ', ' spatial temporal variation ', ' demographics ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' Epidemiologic trend ', ' Epidemiology trend ', ' Epidemiological trend ', ' Anaplasmosis ', ' decision tree learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' human pathogen ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' infection risk ', ' regression trees ', ' tickborne pathogen ', ' tick-borne pathogen ', ' tick bite ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,38185,0.06112347247170777
"Predicting Suicide Attempts in Youth with Child Protective Services Contact The applicant, Mr. Geoffrey Kahn, proposes to identify key, modifiable predictors of attempted suicide among children and youth who have had contact with Child Protective Services (CPS), and quantify the impact of hypothetical preventive interventions that could be implemented for these children. This research will be the foundation of the applicant’s doctoral dissertation, and will serve as one component of a comprehensive training plan to prepare the applicant for a career in independent research. Mr. Kahn will be mentored by a team of co-sponsors and consultants with expertise in suicide prevention, advanced statistical methods, child welfare research, and the CPS system. He will complete coursework in analysis of complex survey data and machine learning methods, participate in working groups on suicide prevention, machine learning, and causal inference at the sponsoring institution, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and present his findings to diverse audiences. The advanced training and focused mentoring that Mr. Kahn will receive through this Fellowship will position him to conduct future, independent research studies on the prevention of suicide, particularly suicide among youth.  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth aged 15-24 years in the US. Suicide rates have been increasing for nearly two decades, with that increase accelerating in recent years. Children who have had contact with Child Protective Services are at increased risk for numerous mental health problems, including suicidal ideation and attempts. The opioid epidemic is thought to be contributing to an increase in the already substantial number of children entering the CPS system. Finally, suicide has been remarkably difficult to predict, with recent meta-analyses showing that most currently identified risk factors do not predict future suicide attempts or deaths significantly better than chance, and predictive accuracy has not improved over the last 50 years of research. Suicide is likely caused by interaction among numerous risk factors, but most studies have examined only single risk factors. New machine learning (ML) methods have been shown to out-perform traditional regression in predictive models, and there are classes of ML algorithms that can identify complex interactions among large numbers of variables. The applicant proposes a multi-part analysis of suicide risk factors among youth with CPS contact. The proposed project will: 1) assess the role of CPS case outcome on access to specialized mental health care and subsequent suicide attempt; 2) use machine learning methods to develop and validate a predictive model for suicide attempts; and 3) apply causal inference methods to quantify the impact of hypothetical interventions on the key risk/protective factors identified in the study.  The proposed project is consistent with NIMH’s strategic priorities, as it will elucidate complex groups of risk factors which contribute to suicidal behavior and identify the most promising targets for intervention. Project Narrative  The proposed project will identify key predictors of suicide attempts among children and youth who have had contact with Child Protective Services (CPS). Machine learning algorithms will be used to evaluate large numbers of variables and find clusters of factors, rather than single risk factors, that predict suicide attempts in a longitudinal cohort of youth. Finally, causal inference methods will be used to quantify the potential impact of intervening on key risk factors which have been identified AND have been determined to be feasible targets for preventive intervention after consulting with experts from the CPS system.",Predicting Suicide Attempts in Youth with Child Protective Services Contact,10003830,F31MH120973,"['Affect ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Welfare ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' child well being ', ' child wellbeing ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foster Home Care ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Social Workers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Supervision ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Administrator ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' foster care ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' Consult ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' child protection services ', ' child protective service ', ' research study ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' neglect and abuse ', ' abuse neglect ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Institution ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' 18 years of age ', ' age 18 years ', ' eighteen year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' 18 year old ', ' stem ', ' service intervention ', ' reduce suicidality ', ' reduce suicide ', ' reducing suicidality ', ' reducing suicide ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' protective factors ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,0.1076395621426017
"Advancing Maryland's Statewide Suicide Data Warehouse to Improve Individual and Population-level Mortality Prediction and Prevention ❖ PROJECT SUMMARY In 2018, NIMH funded the development of the Maryland Suicide Data Warehouse (MSDW). The aim of developing MSDW was to link a diverse set of data sources and use various layers of risk factors to predict suicide death on a generalizable population. Currently, MSDW includes data on ~5+ million Maryland residents spanning from 2012 to 2017. MSDW contains hospital and emergency discharges, health information exchange (HIE) data, commercial insurance claims, medical examiner data, electronic health record (EHR) data from 5 select health systems, and place-based social determinants of health data covering various domains such as housing, employment, education, income and crime. This study will leverage the unique data types linked by MSDW to improve suicide death predictions among generalizable patient populations. Our proposed study will further expand the underlying data and develop cutting-edge use cases of MSDW. The study aims to achieve a number of outcomes: (1) Acquire refreshed data from all existing MSDW data sources; (2) Use the wide array of data sources stored in MSDW to advance the prediction of suicide mortality, while controlling for data quality and potential model bias; (3) Explore various uses cases of the MSDW such as unsupervised clustering of suicide mortality cases; and, (4) Collaborate with external investigators to validate the MSDW-derived predictive models of suicide death. ❖ PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Suicide is a major preventable public health challenge. Close to 48,000 people in the United States died by suicide in 2017 and rates have increased 33% since 1999.

"Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Suicide is among the leading causes of death worldwide and among United States Veterans in particular. Current methods of risk assessment are limited in their ability to accurately identify patients who are at the highest risk of suicide. The overarching goal of this proposal is to strengthen suicide prediction efforts by gaining a more granular understanding of the association between social determinants of health and suicide risk. Social determinants of health (SDH) refer to the conditions in which people are born, live, work, and age. A number of SDH are known risk factors for suicide. While SDH could be obtained from the structured EHR data, their scope is limited. A recent study has shown that EHR notes contain about 90 times more information about SDH than the structured data. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of EHR and new computational methdologies to explore associations between natural language processing extracted SDH and suicide ideation, attempt and death. This approach is critical to the development of next- generation suicide prevention tools.

"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and

"Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting ABSTRACT Significance: As recent national controversy over Joint Commission mandates proves, universal suicide risk screening in emergency departments (ED) will not achieve widespread adoption because confusion remains around which specific risk indicators to assess, and clinicians fear that such screening will lead to massive surges in psychiatric evaluations. To address these two implementation barriers, the proposed study will derive a clinical decision rule to support universal risk detection and optimize patient care workflow in adult patients. Investigators: The Project Team has extensive expertise in ED-based suicide risk screening and assessment (Boudreaux, Larkin), clinical decision rule design (Boudreaux, Stiell), predictive analytics (Wang, Liu, Simon), machine learning and informatics (Liu, Simon), industrial engineering (Johnson), and healthcare economics (Clements). A Clinical Advisory Panel ensures that the proposal is grounded in the practical realities of the ED. Innovation: The proposed study will be the first to apply industry standards for deriving decision rules to suicide risk and will directly inform the controversy regarding the relative strengths and weaknesses of universal versus targeted screening. We will pioneer new statistical innovations for rule derivation and will integrate simulation of potential workflow impact using industrial engineering modeling and economic analyses. Approach: We have already developed a pool of empirically supported, clinician-acceptable candidate suicide risk indicators. Data on these candidate indicators will be collected by trained research staff on 500 adult medical patients and 500 adult psychiatric patients from a large ED. Participants will undergo a comprehensive suicide risk assessment by a research clinical psychologist blinded to the indicators who will assign the participant to a criterion reference risk group: Negligible, Mild-Moderate, or High risk. Participants will be followed for 24 weeks after the visit to assess suicidal behavior, our secondary outcome. In Aim 1, we will derive a universal screening decision rule for “all comers,” as well as a variant to be used with patients presenting with a psychiatric chief complaint (targeted). In Aim 2, we will test whether a previously validated risk stratification algorithm using data from the electronic health record improves the performance of the decision rules. In Aim 3, we will model the potential operational impact of the rules through dynamic modeling of clinical workflow and economic costs and assessing clinician and patient acceptability in a new sample of 100 ED clinician-patient dyads. Environment: UMass has demonstrated its capability to support this study through several key preliminary studies, including the ED-SAFE studies, System of Safety, and other suicide-related studies set in the ED. Impact: By providing clear, evidence-based recommendations on universal screening and optimized workflow using standards accepted by emergency clinicians, this study will address two pivotal barriers to universal suicide risk screening, transforming the “right thing” into the “easy thing” so it becomes the “usual thing.” NARRATIVE Effective prevention of suicide among adult emergency department (ED) patients hinges on two indispensable components: effective identification of all patients who are at risk for suicidal behavior, and successful delivery of effective interventions to those with risk. Because many ED patients have hidden risk and do not present with psychiatric chief complaints, universal screening has been recommended by several prominent groups, such as the Joint Commission and the Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention; however, two trenchant barriers prevent such universal screening from being widely implemented, namely, (1) lack of clarity around the specific indicators to use for screening and (2) fear that screening all-comers will cause ED workflow to come to a grinding halt because of surges in psychiatric evaluations and boarding. The proposed study will address these two barriers by deriving the first clinical decision rule for use with all ED patients using rigorous standards and procedures and modelling its impact on workflow and costs, thereby revolutionizing the field's ability to actualize the first indispensable component of suicide prevention: effective, efficient identification and triaging of suicide risk, both hidden and obvious.",Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting,9851004,R01MH118220,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Consultations ', ' Economic Models ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' indexing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychologist ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Triage ', ' Measures ', ' Emergency Nursing ', ' ED Nursing ', ' ED nurse ', ' ER Nursing ', ' ER nurse ', ' Emergency Department nurse ', ' Emergency Room Nursing ', ' Emergency nurse ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' economic analysis ', ' economic evaluation ', ' Blinded ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Published Comment ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' In Situ ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' Informatics ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' healthcare economics ', ' health care economics ', ' economic cost ', ' Cervical Vertebrae ', ' Cervical spine ', ' Blunt Trauma ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Research Training ', ' Stratification ', ' Sum ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Screening Result ', ' Validation ', ' trend ', ' Derivation ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' electronic data ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' suicide patient ', ' suicidal patient ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' secondary outcome ', ' clinical practice ', ' common rule ', ' screening ', ' ED patient ', ' ER patient ', ' Emergency Room patient ', ' Emergency Department patient ', ' ED-based intervention ', ' Emergency Department-based Intervention ', ' ED Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' Industry Standard ', ' inferential statistics ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Self-Direction ', ' Risk stratification ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,831964,0.10017851386593336
"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia ABSTRACT: Administrative Supplements for NIMH Grants to Expand Suicide Research  Suicide is among the top leading causes of death in the US; individuals with schizophrenia (Sz) have a lifetime risk of more than tenfold that of the general population. Suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) are prevalent also in clinical risk states for schizophrenia, in teens and young adults at increased clinical high risk (CHR) for Sz and related psychotic disorders, based on attenuated psychotic symptoms (APS). In CHR cohorts, lifetime prevalence is ~77% for suicidal ideation and ~20% for suicidal behavior and attempts. Base rates for suicide by death after ascertainment is ~1% within a few years. Despite the clear public health problem of SIB in CHR teens and young adults, there is a clear gap in our understanding of their associated mechanisms and neural substrates, and their demographic, symptom and clinical correlates. It is important to gain a better understanding of SIB in CHR individuals in order to extend prevention efforts for CHR individuals beyond prevention of psychosis and poor functional outcome to include suicide prevention as well.  This proposal is an administrative supplement submitted in response to NOT-MH-19-026 Administrative Supplements for NIMH Grants to Expand Suicide Research, for the parent R01 of “Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia” (end 2021). It capitalizes on the parent R01's prospective cohort that includes data across multiple levels of analysis, including behavior (language, social cognition, symptoms) and circuits (brain structure and function), as well as data on SIB collected for purposes of safety, using the PhenX toolkit measure of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Therefore, this supplement does not entail the addition of any new measures. It is expected there will be data on 90 CHR, 25 Sz, and 25 healthy individuals by mid-2020 amenable for analysis (preliminary data now includes 30 CHR).  This supplement adds a new specific aim relevant to suicide risk, namely to identify linguistic/cognitive biomarkers, symptom/demographic correlates and neural substrates of C-SSRS SIB in CHR individuals using advanced analytic methods, including natural language processing, machine learning, penalized regression, and sparse modeling. The work proposed is within the scope of the parent R01 as it entails the application of similar advanced analytic methods to the same dataset, to understand mechanisms of key clinical features in a young at-risk cohort (parent R01: psychosis risk: supplement: suicide risk). It is hypothesized that SIB will be associated in CHR individuals with greater use of words with negative emotional content and greater self-focus in language (use of personal pronouns), social cognitive deficits, depression, motivational deficits, gray matter reduction and abnormal resting connectivity. Suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) is prevalent in schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, including during putative prodromal stages, in teens and young adults at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis; however, little is known about the mechanisms and neural substrates that underlie SIB in at-risk youths. This proposal for an administrative supplement capitalizes on a large prospective CHR cohort study that has data available across behavioral (language, social cognition, symptoms) and circuit-based (brain structure and function) levels, as well as safety data on SIB from a measure in the PhenX toolkit. It employs advanced analytic methods and automated language analysis to gain a better understanding of SIB in psychosis risk states, key for development of suicide prevention efforts in this risk group of young people.",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9941435,R01MH107558,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Emotions ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Grant ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Language Disorders ', ' Language disability ', ' language deficit ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Parents ', ' Phenotype ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Semantics ', ' Speech ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' ER Positive ', ' ER+ ', ' Estrogen receptor positive ', ' event related potential ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' Attenuated ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Severities ', ' Auditory ', ' Parietal ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Inferior ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' visual processing ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' deviancy ', ' deviant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' social cognition ', ' Symptoms ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' life-time risk ', ' lifetime risk ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Teenagers ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' neural dysfunction ', ' Neuronal Dysfunction ', ' suicide death ', ' suicide morbidity ', ' suicidal morbidity ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' language processing ', ' parent grant ', ' high risk ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' neural patterning ', ' natural language ', ' clinical risk ', ' psychotic symptoms ', ' prognostic ability ', ' prognostic power ', ' prognostic utility ', ' prognostic value ', ' prognostic tool ', ' language impairment ', ' connectome ', ' clinical outcome prediction ', ' predictor of clinical outcome ', ' predict clinical outcome ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' auditory processing ', ' recruit ', ' automated analysis ', ' advanced analytics ', ' ']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,150193,0.028729742692352157
"Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually. Despite ongoing efforts to reduce the burden of suicide and suicidal behavior, rates have remained relatively constant over the past half century. Attempts to predict suicidal behavior have relied almost exclusively on self-reporting of suicidal thoughts and intentions. This is problematic because of well-known reporting biases and the fact that many people at high risk are motivated to deny suicidal thoughts to avoid hospitalization. Even though the majority of all suicide decedents have contact with a healthcare professional in the month before their death, suicide risk is rarely detected in such cases. Efforts to identify risk factors have also been stymied by the fact that suicide is a low-base rate event so that very large samples are needed to test the complex combinations of factors that are likely to contribute to risk. The widespread adoption of longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) has created a powerful but still under-utilized resource for detecting and predicting important health outcomes. In prior work using machine learning methods to analyze structured EHR data, we have developed predictive models that detect up to 45% of first-episode suicidal behavior, on average 3 years in advance. Here we aim to systematically extend and improve our EHR prediction methods in a large healthcare system (N = 4.6 million patients) by incorporating 1) external public record datasets (LexisNexis SocioEconomic Health Attribute data) that include environmental, socioeconomic, and life event information; 2) natural language processing (NLP) to leverage unstructured EHR text, including text-based scores that capture RDoC domains; 3) a novel method of deriving temporal risk envelopes to capture the time-dependent effects of individual risk factors; and 4) clinical risk trajectories that incorporate ordered temporal sequences of risk factors. We will systematically compare the performance of each of these approaches to identify optimal strategies for enhancing risk surveillance and prediction in healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would represent a crucial step towards novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually, with 1.4 million attempting suicide annually. Unfortunately, efforts to identify those at high risk have had limited success. We have previously used machine learning methods to predict risk of suicidal behavior using the vast resources of data available in electronic health records. The proposed research will extend and improve this work by leveraging external datasets, medical record notes, and trajectories of risk over time to facilitate novel, clinically relevant, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior.",Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets,9930662,R01MH117599,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Calibration ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chronology ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Maps ', ' Markov Chains ', ' Markov Process ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Patients ', ' PF4 Gene ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' SCYB4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' suicide risk ', ' suicidal risk ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Legal ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' information resource ', ' knowledge resource ', ' knowledge resources ', ' Information Resources ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Text ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' suicide rate ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' markov model ', ' process reproducibility ', ' process repeatability ', ' Outcome ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' high risk ', ' electronic structure ', ' clinical risk ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' discrete time ', ' improved outcome ', ' data resource ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' risk prediction model ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' multiple data sets ', ' multiple datasets ', ' structured data ', ' feature extraction ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,504970,0.10587873153326578
"Using multimodal imaging and the RDoC framework to predict risk factors for suicide attempt Project Summary Suicide is one of the greatest challenges facing Society today. Although research to date has provided important insight into the risk factors for suicide, it has struggled to make a translational impact on preventing suicide. New research strategies are therefore vital. The RDoC framework offers a promising approach to researching suicide, by moving the focus away from mental illness as the primary predictor of suicide, towards an emphasis on transdiagnostic dimensions, novel predictors, and integration of multiple units of analysis. Identifying the neurobiology underlying the transdiagnostic risk factors for suicide is an important step in understanding the mechanisms that lead to suicide. The majority of neuroimaging research to date has been purely correlational in nature, and often fails to generalize outside of the study sample. Predictive modelling, on the other hand, uses cross-validation to increase generalizability, and allows for the prediction of behavior, which is likely to have greater real-world utility. In this proposal, we will use the RDoC framework, multimodal imaging and predictive modelling to identify the molecular and network-level underpinnings of risk factors for suicide in a large, transdiagnostic dataset. Specifically, we aim to use Connectome-based Predictive Modelling (CPM) to generate and validate predictive models of suicide risk factors (depression severity, impulsivity, executive dysfunction and sleep disturbances), transdiagnostically, based on existing functional connectivity data (aim 1). Further, convergent research implicates glutamate dysfunction in suicidality, and emerging evidence suggests a specific role for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in suicide and suicide-related behaviors. Subjects in the existing dataset also participated in PET imaging with and [18F]FPEB, a radioligand specific for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). We will investigate the association between mGluR5 and risk factors for suicide transdiagnostically (aim 2). Finally, we propose to integrate fMRI and PET data by using PET-weighted CPM to predict risk factors for suicide transdiagnostically (aim 3). Here, we will assess whether combining molecular and circuit-level units of analysis increases predictive performance and identifies novel predictive networks. In summary, we propose to use cutting-edge multimodal imaging, computational modelling and the RDoC framework in an innovative approach to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying risk factors for suicide across psychiatric disorders. Findings of the proposed study have the potential to inform risk models and identify novel molecular and network-level targets for preventative and treatment strategies that are critically needed to reduce the suicide rate. Project Narrative Suicide rates in the US are at their highest levels in over 3 decades. New research avenues need to be explored to elucidate the mechanisms that lead to suicide, and to identify novel targets for prevention and treatment strategies. In an innovative approach, we will combine the RDoC framework, MRI and PET imaging, and predictive modelling to provide novel insight into the neural mechanisms underlying risk factors for suicide in a transdiagnostic dataset including individuals with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder and healthy controls.",Using multimodal imaging and the RDoC framework
