"Genomic Reconstruction of Yeast Transcription Networks DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Organisms devote a significant fraction of their genomes to encoding regulatory information which specifies when and where different genes should be turned on or off. Such information is essential for understanding development, tissue specificity, and cellular response to the environment and has great importance for understanding the molecular basis of disease. The one dimensional regulatory programs encoded in DNA are executed by transcription factors which respond to different conditions and regulate gene expression combinatorially, leading to complex regulatory networks. The goal of the proposed research is to develop theoretical models and computational algorithms to decipher the regulatory programs and to reconstruct the transcription networks in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The following are the specific aims: 1) to systematically map the DNA recognition sites and target genes of transcription factors in the genome, 2) to identify environmental and genetic perturbations under which each transcription factor is activated or deactivated, 3) to systematically analyze combinatorial regulation by multiple transcription factors, 4) collaborate with two experimental labs to address specific problems of transcriptional regulation and combinatorial control, and 5) to build databases and online tools for the biological community to analyze gene expression data and transcriptional regulation. We will develop methods integrating information from the genome sequences for several yeast species and genome-wide functional data, and we will combine bioinformatics analysis with mechanistic models of gene regulation.

"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution. Finally, this project will be opportunistic in identifying and addressing unforseen statistical problems arising in human gene mapping studies.           ",Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping,7292731,R01HG003618,"['Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Biochemical Reaction ', ' Enzymatic Reaction ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Human Gene Mapping ', ' Human genetic mapping ', ' Human Gene Mapping DNA Sequencing ', ' Rate ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Finland ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Genome ', ' base ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Human Genome Project ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Numbers ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Normal Statistical Distribution ', ' Normal Distribution ', ' Gaussian Distribution ', ' Paper ', ' Genetic ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Nature ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Solutions ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' trait ', ' simulation ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Categories ', ' Disease regression ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' genetic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' user-friendly ', ' human disease ', ' ']",NHGRI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,297126,0.0781484895801471
"Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding regulatory networks controlling gene expression is one of the fundamental problems of modern biology. The proposed research focuses on the methods of locating regulatory elements in DNA. We have developed a new maximum likelihood method based on the physical DNA dependent binding probability of a transcription factor (TF) that correctly incorporates the protein concentration dependent saturation effect. The advantage of keeping the saturation effect is that the method automatically provides a score threshold for classifying candidate sites into binders and non-binders. Most conventional methods, based on the information score, merely provide a relative ordering of candidate sequences. The principled choice of a threshold is extremely useful for dealing with the highly variable sites typical of global regulatory factors. The simplest of our algorithms reduces to a one-class support vector machine. This classifier will be applied to detect large regulons in E. coli, as well as in phages, with special attention to targets of sigma factors. We also develop classifiers for regulatory targets that go beyond pure sequence analysis and combine it with information from additional sources, like microarray expression data or sequence similarity between phylogenetically closely related species. The proposed computational effort will be complemented by experiments verifying the predictions as well as providing in vitro and in vivo data needed to make predictions. Experimental efforts will involve a high throughput low stringency SELEX method applied to global transcriptional regulators from E. coli. It will also involve chromatin immunoprecipitation and beta- galactosidase assays performed in S. Cerevisiae that test the ability of bioinformatic algorithms to predict functionality of TF binding sites. A special feature of this proposal is the analysis of the effect of the rest of the promoter on the regulatory potential of a site. We apply the lessons learnt in simple organisms to the elucidation of distinctive specificity of different NFkB proteins involved in immunity, inflammation and cancer. Mutation, over-expression and amplification of genes encoding transcription factors play an important role in many diseases from diabetes to cancer. Understanding how a factor targets genes is crucial for discovering the pathways whose malfunction leads to the symptoms. This is an achievable goal, given the right way to analyze the plethora of genome-wide data available to us.           ",Locating Regulatory Elements in Genomes,7221303,R01HG003470,"['Data ', ' Detection ', ' Protein Overexpression ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vivo ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analysis ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Evolution ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Gene Amplification ', ' natural gene amplification ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Algorithms ', ' Site ', ' Regulon ', ' Immunity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Inflammation ', ' Learning ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Mating Types ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Play ', ' Probability ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Ribosomes ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' S.

"Genetic variation and regulatory networks:  Mechanisms and complexity The focus of the proposed research is to understand the effect of sequence variation on the function of molecular networks. We will develop computational algorithms that integrate genotype, gene expression and phenotype data to construct models that describe how sequence variation perturbs the regulatory network, alters signal processing and is manifested in cellular phenotypes. Our approach is based on Bayesian networks, a framework we pioneered for the reconstruction of molecular networks from high-throughput data. We recently applied this framework to develop the Geronemo algorithm which we applied to yeast and uncovered a novel relationship between the sequence specific RNA factor PUF3 and P-Bodies, as well as a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in MKT1 that modulates this relationship. Both novel findings were experimentally validated subsequent to their discovery. Our approach is based on the complementary duality between genetic sequence and functional genomics. A significant influence of genotype on phenotype is induced by fine tuned perturbations to the complex regulatory network that governs a cell's activity. Variation in the expression of a single gene is more tractable and can be used as an intermediary to help associate genetic factors to the more complex downstream changes in phenotype in a hierarchical fashion. Conversely, DNA sequence polymorphisms are effective perturb-agens which provide a rich source of variation to help uncover regulatory relations in the molecular network as well as direct their causality. We will develop our methods using a large collection of highly variable yeast strains, for which we have generated robust quantitative growth curves under numerous environmental conditions. The methodologies piloted in yeast will be extended to genotype and gene expression data derived from tumor samples to attempt to elucidate the multiple genetic factors that drive their proliferation. These tools will be made publicly available, including a friendly graphical user interface and visualization.

"Application of MAGNet Tools to Gene Regulatory Networks in Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Application of MAGNet Tools to Gene Regulatory Networks in Cancer Principal Investigator: Sander, Chris Project Summary / Abstract We propose to apply computational algorithms from the Columbia University National Center for Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet) to study gene regulatory networks in human cancer. The project will be led by the Computational Biology Center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and will build an intensive collaboration between computer scientists and clinical researchers. The aims of this project are to:  Make discoveries about gene regulation in soft tissue sarcoma and prostate cancer.  Strengthen the National Center's computational tools for the analysis of gene regulation and biological pathways, and  Develop better methods for predicting disease outcome in cancer patients. Specifically, advanced computational algorithms and software developed as part of this project will be used to predict gene regulators and their targets from mRNA and microRNA expression profiles. We propose to study three types of gene regulation in cancer samples: i) transcription of protein coding genes ii) transcription of microRNA genes and iii) translational regulation of protein coding genes by mature microRNAs. The predicted regulatory events will be compared with biological knowledge in pathway databases in order to discover novel regulatory events, detect biological processes characteristic of specific cancer subtypes and assess the accuracy of the prediction algorithms. Such detailed knowledge of gene regulation can improve the prediction of clinical outcomes and guide the choice of therapy for individual patients. Application of MAGNet Tools to Gene Regulatory Networks in Cancer Principal Investigator: Sander, Chris Project Narrative We propose to analyze molecular genetic data from cancer patients using advanced computational methods. The research supports the long-term goal of building genomic profiling tools for predicting disease outcome and response to therapy in individual cancer patients.          ",Application of MAGNet

"Analysis of mRNA Polyadenylation across Species and Tissues    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): mRNA polyadenylation is an essential step for the maturation of almost all eukaryotic mRNAs. Altered polyadenylation activity caused by genetic mutation has been implicated in a growing number of human diseases. Over half of the human genes contain multiple polyadenylation sites [poly(A) sites] supported by cDNA/EST sequences. The polyadenylation pattern in the 3'- most exon defines the 3' UnTranslated Region (UTR), which contains various cis regulatory elements for mRNA metabolism, such as microRNA (miRNA) target sites and AU-rich elements (AUEs). In addition, a large fraction of human genes have polyadenylation events in introns, leading to mRNA variants with different protein coding sequence and indicating dynamic interplay between polyadenylation and splicing. Regulation of gene expression by polyadenylation has been characterized only for a handful of model genes, and its mechanism is poorly understood on the systems level. The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which mRNA polyadenylation regulates gene expression in eukaryotic genomes. There are two specific aims in this project: 1) To accurately predict poly(A) sites across metazoan species using their corresponding cis elements; 2) To quantitatively model poly(A) site usage and selection across human and mouse tissues. We will combine computational and molecular biology techniques to address these issues. The results will improve gene annotation in metazoan species, uncover gene regulation events mediated by alternative polyadenylation, elucidate 3' UTR evolution, shed light on the mechanisms of polyadenylation, and provide valuable tools to examine human mutations and polymorphisms that affect poly(A) sites.

"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes.

"A Data Analysis Center for integration of fly and worm modENCODE datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances. By their smaller genome size, powerful genetics, and ease of experimentation, D. melanogaster and C. elegans can help guide the study of functional elements in the human genome, reveal new insights into global gene regulation and embryo development, and enable experimental studies of gene function and regulation which are not accessible in mammalian systems. This proposal aims to enhance the value of these datasets by creating a Data Analysis Center (DAC) to support, facilitate, and enhance integrative analyses of the modENCODE consortium in fly and worm, to achieve a high-resolution annotation of all their functional elements, and to reveal new insights into the biology and gene regulation of animal genomes including the human. We foresee four central roles for the DAC, and have organized our aims around them. Aim 1: We will provide common computational guidelines for data processing in fly and worm, a common computational infrastructure and pipeline for common analysis and statistical tasks. Aim 2: We will facilitate and carry out element-specific integrative analyses to identify diverse classes of functional elements based on combinations of relevant datasets coming from multiple groups. This includes (a) enhancers, promoters, insulators, and other regions of regulatory importance, (b) protein-coding and non-coding genes, (c) regulatory networks of transcription factor and microRNA targeting, and (d) sequence features predictive of diverse classes of functional elements. Aim 3: We will carry out exploratory data analyses across different data types to discover potentially novel correlations and insights relating diverse classes of elements. In particular we will apply dimensionality reduction techniques to coordinate-based genome-wide genomic and epigenomic datasets, we will apply clustering and bi-clustering methods to identify functionally related sets of genes and modules, and we will analyze structural and dynamic properties of discovered networks. Aim 4: We will carry out comparative analyses across the two model organisms, and also with yeast and human. We will provide an ortholog resource between the species, compare regulatory relationships and dynamics for orthologous cell lines and developmental points, and carry over biological knowledge across model organisms and human. To achieve these four aims, we will work closely with members of the consortium, the modENCODE Analysis Working Group (AWG), consisting of all Principal Investigators and analysis groups, and the Data Coordination Center (DCC), responsible for all data sharing within the consortium and with the larger worm and fly communities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances.

"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome, transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition, such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.           Project Narrative We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome, transcriptome, and phenome.

"Machine Learning Analysis of Genetic Modulators of Vaccine Immune Response Abstract Machine Learning Analysis of Genetic Modulators of Vaccine Immune Response. This proposal describes the development of a machine-learning strategy to identify interacting susceptibility loci in polygenic biological endpoints, with a focus on smallpox and anthrax vaccine-related adverse events (AEs) and variation in serologic antibody response. The appearance of AEs following smallpox vaccination stems from excess stimulation of inflammatory pathways and is likely affected by multiple, interacting genetic factors. Some of these gene-gene interactions may be epistatic, having no distinct marginal effect for any single variant. Analytical approaches are needed for testing association in genome-wide data to account for conditional dependencies between genetic variants while still accounting for co-occurring variants with high marginal effects. We have introduced a machine-learning feature selection and optimization method called Evaporative Cooling (EC), which is based on information theory and the statistical thermodynamics of cooling a system of interacting particles by evaporation. The objective of the EC learner is the identification of susceptibility or protective genes in genome-wide DNA sequence data. This novel filter method, which includes no assumptions regarding gene interaction architecture or interaction order, has been shown to identify a spectrum of disease susceptibility models, including marginal main effects and pure interaction effects. Characterizing the genetic basis of multifactorial phenotypes in genome-wide sequence data is also computationally challenging due to the presence of a large number of noise variants, or variants that are irrelevant to the phenotype. Thus, the EC algorithm evaporates (i.e., removes) noise variants, leaving behind a minimal collection of variants enriched for relevance to the given phenotype. We propose to advance this method to characterize and interpret singe-gene, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions all of which may modulate complex phenotypes such as vaccine-associated AEs and human immune response. This strategy will be developed with the aid of artificial data, simulated under a variety of conditions observed in real data, and the strategy will be tested on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and clinical data from volunteers from a NIAID/NIH-sponsored trial to evaluate the Aventis Pasteur Smallpox Vaccine and a Center for Disease Control sponsored trial to evaluate Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed. Susceptibility to common complex disorders is likely due to a combination of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions as well as single-gene associations. In this proposal, we will develop a new bioinformatics strategy for identifying networks of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence susceptibility to complex disorders from genome-wide data. The proposed strategy will be developed to identify networks associated with adverse events and the human immune response following smallpox and anthrax vaccination.",Machine Learning Analysis of Genetic Modulators of Vaccine Immune Response,7919847,R56AI080932,"['Decision Trees ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' genetic association ', ' Engineering ', ' Genetic Epistasis ', ' genetic epistases ', ' gene x gene interaction ', ' Interaction Deviation ', ' Epistatic Deviation ', ' Epistasis ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Gene Combinations ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Gases ', ' Affect ', ' Genes ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Left ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Serological ', ' Serologic ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Immunity ', ' Information Theory ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Learning ', ' Sample Size ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Noise ', ' Simulate ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Anthrax disease ', ' Anthrax ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Antibody Formation ', ' immunoglobulin biosynthesis ', ' antibody biosynthesis ', ' Antibody Response ', ' Antibody Production ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Research ', ' Anthrax Vaccines ', ' Smallpox ', ' variola major ', ' small pox ', ' Variola ', ' Smallpox Vaccine ', ' small pox vaccine ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Testing ', ' Thermodynamics ', ' Thermodynamic ', ' Vaccination ', ' Vaccines ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' evaporation ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene interaction ', ' particle ', ' novel ', ' Appearance ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' Measures ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' abstracting ', ' forest ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genetic variant ', ' Coupling ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' volunteer ', ' stem ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TULSA,R56,2009,346329,0.09668500413966492
"Analysis of mRNA Polyadenylation across Species and Tissues    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): mRNA polyadenylation is an essential step for the maturation of almost all eukaryotic mRNAs. Altered polyadenylation activity caused by genetic mutation has been implicated in a growing number of human diseases. Over half of the human genes contain multiple polyadenylation sites [poly(A) sites] supported by cDNA/EST sequences. The polyadenylation pattern in the 3'- most exon defines the 3' UnTranslated Region (UTR), which contains various cis regulatory elements for mRNA metabolism, such as microRNA (miRNA) target sites and AU-rich elements (AUEs). In addition, a large fraction of human genes have polyadenylation events in introns, leading to mRNA variants with different protein coding sequence and indicating dynamic interplay between polyadenylation and splicing.

We recently applied this framework to develop the Geronemo algorithm which we applied to yeast and uncovered a novel relationship between the sequence specific RNA factor PUF3 and P-Bodies, as well as a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in MKT1 that modulates this relationship. Both novel findings were experimentally validated subsequent to their discovery. Our approach is based on the complementary duality between genetic sequence and functional genomics. A significant influence of genotype on phenotype is induced by fine tuned perturbations to the complex regulatory network that governs a cell's activity. Variation in the expression of a single gene is more tractable and can be used as an intermediary to help associate genetic factors to the more complex downstream changes in phenotype in a hierarchical fashion. Conversely, DNA sequence polymorphisms are effective perturb-agens which provide a rich source of variation to help uncover regulatory relations in the molecular network as well as direct their causality. We will develop our methods using a large collection of highly variable yeast strains, for which we have generated robust quantitative growth curves under numerous environmental conditions. The methodologies piloted in yeast will be extended to genotype and gene expression data derived from tumor samples to attempt to elucidate the multiple genetic factors that drive their proliferation. These tools will be made publicly available, including a friendly graphical user interface and visualization.

"Prediction of influenza antigenic variants using a novel sparse multitask learnin    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza and influenza related complication lead to more than 200,000 hospitalizations and approximately 36,000 deaths in the United States each year, and vaccination is the primary option for reducing influenza effect. A large amount of global efforts has to be made each year to identify antigenic variants and decide whether new vaccine strains are needed. Current laboratory based antigenic characterization processes are labor intensive and time consuming, and it has been the bottleneck for generating an effective influenza vaccination program. A robust method without such a laboratory characterization is demanding for rapid identification of influenza antigenic variants. This project proposes to develop a novel sparse multitask learning method in predicting influenza antigenic variants solely based on the input of protein sequences, and further to apply this method in mapping antigenic drift pathway of A/H3N2 influenza viruses and studying antigenic drift patterns leading to influenza outbreaks. This method is based on the assumption that influenza antigenicity would be determined by certain features in hemagglutinin (HA) protein sequence and tertiary structure. This assumption was well evidenced that the viruses with conserved HAs generated cross-reactions in serological reactions and also provided cross- protection in both laboratory experiments and field practices. The proposed method is novel since it combines multitask learning and sparse learning. Therefore not only this project will develop significant technology for antigenic variant screen, but also new machine learning methods. This project will facilitate vaccine strain selection since the proposed method can potentially reduce and even eliminate serological assay, one of the most labor intensive procedures, in influenza surveillance. In addition, the antigenicity specific features and the drift patterns causing influenza outbreaks to be identified in this study will enhance our understanding about antigen-antibody interaction thus enhance our knowledge in influenza immunology and serology. Furthermore, the proposed method is potentially applicable in characterizing antigenic properties of other pathogens with significant antigenic variations, for example, rotavirus. The specific aims are the following: (1) Development of a novel sparse multitask learning method in generating antigenic distance matrix using hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) data; (2) Development of a quantitative method for predicting antigenic variants in silicon; (3) Application of this method in studying seasonal influenza antigenic drift pathway and antigenic drift patterns leading to influenza outbreaks. This nature of this study is to address a novel predictive method for measuring antigenic divergence between influenza viruses, which is critical in influenza vaccine strain selection. Thus, we are submitting this project to the broad challenge area (06) Enabling Technologies and fit for the Specific Challenge 06-GM-103: development of predictive method for molecular structure, recognition, and ligand interaction.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is to develop a novel computational method for influenza antigenic variant prediction, which is very useful in influenza vaccine strain selection.

"Analysis of mRNA Polyadenylation across Species and Tissues    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): mRNA polyadenylation is an essential step for the maturation of almost all eukaryotic mRNAs. Altered polyadenylation activity caused by genetic mutation has been implicated in a growing number of human diseases. Over half of the human genes contain multiple polyadenylation sites [poly(A) sites] supported by cDNA/EST sequences. The polyadenylation pattern in the 3'- most exon defines the 3' UnTranslated Region (UTR), which contains various cis regulatory elements for mRNA metabolism, such as microRNA (miRNA) target sites and AU-rich elements (AUEs). In addition, a large fraction of human genes have polyadenylation events in introns, leading to mRNA variants with different protein coding sequence and indicating dynamic interplay between polyadenylation and splicing. Regulation of gene expression by polyadenylation has been characterized only for a handful of model genes, and its mechanism is poorly understood on the systems level. The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which mRNA polyadenylation regulates gene expression in eukaryotic genomes. There are two specific aims in this project: 1) To accurately predict poly(A) sites across metazoan species using their corresponding cis elements; 2) To quantitatively model poly(A) site usage and selection across human and mouse tissues. We will combine computational and molecular biology techniques to address these issues. The results will improve gene annotation in metazoan species, uncover gene regulation events mediated by alternative polyadenylation, elucidate 3' UTR evolution, shed light on the mechanisms of polyadenylation, and provide valuable tools to examine human mutations and polymorphisms that affect poly(A) sites.

"Arabidopsis N-regulatory network dynamics: Integrating metabolome & transcriptome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research is to use a systems biology approach to collectively analyze and integrate time-dependent data from the transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome components of the N- regulatory network controlling N-assimilation in Arabidopsis. This integrative approach will allow us to dynamically model the flow of N-signal propagation through the N-regulatory network on a systems-wide level and identify the transcriptional cascade involved in this regulation. This goal will be achieved through four aims: 1. Creation of high-resolution dynamic transcriptome datasets to generate a time-dependent nitrogen regulatory network, by performing microarray analysis on Arabidopsis roots and shoots treated with nitrate over a time course. 2. Quantification of metabolite levels and metabolic flux in the N-assimilatory network in response to N-signal, using stable isotope labeled N15 over a time course. 3. Integration of transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome data to create a time-dependent dynamic network model for the control of N- uptake/assimilation, using a series of analytical techniques including lag correlation, linear regression, and machine learning (state space analysis). 4. Functional validation of regulatory network predictions by testing model generated hypotheses with T-DNA mutants and inducible expression systems. The overriding hypothesis being tested is that inorganic-N signals (nitrate) activate motifs involved in regulating nitrate uptake, reduction and assimilation into organic-N (Glu/Gln), used for biosynthetic reactions. The organic-N products (Glu/Gln) in turn activate motifs controlling Asn synthesized for N-storage, and repress ones controlling N- uptake/assimilation. The proposed research will allow me to identify the regulatory genes responding to these inorganic and organic N-signals that regulate genes in the N-uptake and assimilation pathways by integrating genome wide transcriptomic data with metabolomic data. The synthesis of these aims should allow for modeling, predicting and testing how perturbations of the ""system"" may be used to enhance N-use efficiency, which impacts energy-use (fertilizers/biofuels), nitrate contamination of the environment and human nutrition.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term goal of the systems approach described in this proposal is to model and predictively manipulate gene regulatory networks affecting uptake/assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids to improve nitrogen-use-efficiency. This would decrease energy consumption, reduce ground water contamination by nitrates (Health and Environment) and improve seed yield, with implications for human health (Nutrition) and biofuels (Energy). Moreover, the systems biology approach and the tools that will be developed in this project can be applied to any species for which genome data is available, which will enable researchers to model and manipulate a broad spectrum of regulatory circuits in biology with potential medical and pharmaceutical applications.           Project Narrative The long-term goal of the systems approach described in this proposal is to model and predictively manipulate gene regulatory networks affecting uptake/assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids to improve nitrogen-use-efficiency.

"Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which degeneration of language regions in the dominant hemisphere is associated with progressive deficits in speech and/or language function. The overall goals of this project are to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural changes underlying linguistic deficits in PPA, and to use this information to better discriminate patients with variants of PPA from each other and from normal aging.

"A Data Analysis Center for integration of fly and worm modENCODE datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances. By their smaller genome size, powerful genetics, and ease of experimentation, D. melanogaster and C. elegans can help guide the study of functional elements in the human genome, reveal new insights into global gene regulation and embryo development, and enable experimental studies of gene function and regulation which are not accessible in mammalian systems. This proposal aims to enhance the value of these datasets by creating a Data Analysis Center (DAC) to support, facilitate, and enhance integrative analyses of the modENCODE consortium in fly and worm, to achieve a high-resolution annotation of all their functional elements, and to reveal new insights into the biology and gene regulation of animal genomes including the human. We foresee four central roles for the DAC, and have organized our aims around them. Aim 1: We will provide common computational guidelines for data processing in fly and worm, a common computational infrastructure and pipeline for common analysis and statistical tasks. Aim 2: We will facilitate and carry out element-specific integrative analyses to identify diverse classes of functional elements based on combinations of relevant datasets coming from multiple groups. This includes (a) enhancers, promoters, insulators, and other regions of regulatory importance, (b) protein-coding and non-coding genes, (c) regulatory networks of transcription factor and microRNA targeting, and (d) sequence features predictive of diverse classes of functional elements. Aim 3: We will carry out exploratory data analyses across different data types to discover potentially novel correlations and insights relating diverse classes of elements. In particular we will apply dimensionality reduction techniques to coordinate-based genome-wide genomic and epigenomic datasets, we will apply clustering and bi-clustering methods to identify functionally related sets of genes and modules, and we will analyze structural and dynamic properties of discovered networks. Aim 4: We will carry out comparative analyses across the two model organisms, and also with yeast and human. We will provide an ortholog resource between the species, compare regulatory relationships and dynamics for orthologous cell lines and developmental points, and carry over biological knowledge across model organisms and human. To achieve these four aims, we will work closely with members of the consortium, the modENCODE Analysis Working Group (AWG), consisting of all Principal Investigators and analysis groups, and the Data Coordination Center (DCC), responsible for all data sharing within the consortium and with the larger worm and fly communities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances.

"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome, transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition, such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.          Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome.

"Genetics Variants in the Genome Predisposing to Aggressive PCa    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fortunately, most men diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) will not die from their disease, and some men diagnosed may not even require treatment for their cancers. However, on the other end of the spectrum, ~30,000 men annually die from PCa in the US alone. For these latter men, the concept of PCa as an indolent disease obviously does not apply. Understanding the molecular basis of aggressive PCa (aPCa) vs. indolent PCa (non-aPCa) is perhaps the most important basic, yet translational question in PCa biology. We hypothesize that multiple sequence variants in the genome confer risk to aPCa but not to non-aPCa. Taking advantage of the publicly available CGEMS genome wide association data, as well as the large and unique PCa patient population at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH), we propose a systematic genetic association study to confirm, fine map, and better characterize genetic risk variants for aPCa. We propose three specific aims: 1)Test the genetic variants implicated in the CGEMS study that distinguish aPCa from non-aPCa among ~3,000 aPCa and ~5,000 non-aPCa patients of European ancestry from the JHH, 2) Fine map the genomic regions for the SNPs implicated in Aim 1 among 3,000 aPCa and 5,000 non-aPCa patients of European ancestry from the JHH, and 3) Assess the association of the most significant SNPs found in Aim 2 with disease characteristics in all 8,000 patients, and with disease progression in a subset of patients that have follow-up data at JHH. In addition, we have two exploratory aims: 1) fine mapping of regions containing SNPs significant in European Americans in aPCa and non-aPCa in African Americans, and 2) testing for gene-gene interaction. Besides the obvious clues that the proposed research may provide in terms of etiologic mechanisms, this study may also lead to identification of new target genes and proteins for therapy and possible preventive strategies. Furthermore, the identification of multiple variants can lead to the development of a test panel that may improve prediction of aPCa risk.                                                 Project Narrative  Prostate cancer is a common cancer that varies widely in its aggressiveness.

"Novel Statistical Methods for Human Gene Mapping    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many common human diseases originate in part from the complicated effects of multiple genetic variants found throughout the genome. Given the enormous impact of such diseases on public health, it is imperative to map relevant genetic variants to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of such diseases, as well as improve screening techniques for disease prevention. To this end, successful human gene mapping of complex diseases requires the development and application of powerful statistical methods that fully utilize the resources of the Human Genome Project. This grant proposes a set of such statistical methods that either address novel problems or improve existing solutions to problems in human gene mapping studies. These proposed methods are applicable to a variety of genetic studies as they address topics in linkage, linkage disequilibrium, and high-dimensional genetic analyses of complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. The methods can be partitioned into the two general groups: mixed-modeling procedures and case-control likelihood procedures. The mixed-modeling procedures considered include a general variance-component (VC) mapping framework for continuous and discrete trait data and a modified VC mapping framework that allows for haplotypes. Also considered is a novel linear-mixed-model framework that identifies a large combination of genetic variants that influence a quantitative trait using support-vector- machine regression. The case-control likelihood procedures considered are extensions of the approach of Epstein and Satten (2003) for haplotype inference on disease. Extensions considered include allowing for covariates and haplotype-covariate interactions, and also categorical disease outcomes. The proposed statistical methods in this grant have the potential to increase the power to identify genetic variants that influence complex diseases and disease-related quantitative traits. This project will evaluate the performance of these methods using simulations based on the study design and data from an existing gene mapping study of type 2 diabetes. Also, this grant will implement the proposed statistical methods in user- friendly, efficient software for public distribution.

"Analysis of mRNA Polyadenylation across Species and Tissues    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): mRNA polyadenylation is an essential step for the maturation of almost all eukaryotic mRNAs. Altered polyadenylation activity caused by genetic mutation has been implicated in a growing number of human diseases. Over half of the human genes contain multiple polyadenylation sites [poly(A) sites] supported by cDNA/EST sequences. The polyadenylation pattern in the 3'- most exon defines the 3' UnTranslated Region (UTR), which contains various cis regulatory elements for mRNA metabolism, such as microRNA (miRNA) target sites and AU-rich elements (AUEs). In addition, a large fraction of human genes have polyadenylation events in introns, leading to mRNA variants with different protein coding sequence and indicating dynamic interplay between polyadenylation and splicing. Regulation of gene expression by polyadenylation has been characterized only for a handful of model genes, and its mechanism is poorly understood on the systems level. The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms by which mRNA polyadenylation regulates gene expression in eukaryotic genomes. There are two specific aims in this project: 1) To accurately predict poly(A) sites across metazoan species using their corresponding cis elements; 2) To quantitatively model poly(A) site usage and selection across human and mouse tissues. We will combine computational and molecular biology techniques to address these issues. The results will improve gene annotation in metazoan species, uncover gene regulation events mediated by alternative polyadenylation, elucidate 3' UTR evolution, shed light on the mechanisms of polyadenylation, and provide valuable tools to examine human mutations and polymorphisms that affect poly(A) sites.

"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the  outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and  interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but  also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations  we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view  of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to  disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.",Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu,8054816,R01GM087694,"['Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' biomarker ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' Syndrome ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Genome ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecuar profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Genotype ', ' Affect ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Molecular ', ' Gene Expression ', ' improved ', ' Maps ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Algorithms ', ' Cells ', ' Address ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Family ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Phenotype ', ' Testing ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Elements ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Clinical ', ' Detection ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Measures ', ' Population ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Complex ', ' novel ', ' Genes ', ' Work ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Outcome ', ' Research ', ' Methods ', ' base ', ' Time ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Techniques ', ' Structure ', ' Individual ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Technology ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' Lasso ', ' Plastics ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' grasp ', ' Grips ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Descriptor ', ' Admixture ', ' trait ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Haplotypes ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' DNA recombination (naturally occurring) ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Indium ', ' In element ', ' Transcript ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' Study Subject ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' data integration ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' genetic linkage analysis ', ' linkage analyses ', ' genetic linkage analyses ', ' family based linkage study ', ' Linkage Analysis ', ' Graph ', ' gene function ', ' phenome ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' ']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,513100,0.04280814151577329
"A Data Analysis Center for integration of fly and worm modENCODE datasets    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The aims of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and modENCODE (model organism ENCODE) projects are to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a catalog of functional elements in the human, worm, and fly genomes, which will serve as the basis for biomedical research advances. By their smaller genome size, powerful genetics, and ease of experimentation, D. melanogaster and C. elegans can help guide the study of functional elements in the human genome, reveal new insights into global gene regulation and embryo development, and enable experimental studies of gene function and regulation which are not accessible in mammalian systems. This proposal aims to enhance the value of these datasets by creating a Data Analysis Center (DAC) to support, facilitate, and enhance integrative analyses of the modENCODE consortium in fly and worm, to achieve a high-resolution annotation of all their functional elements, and to reveal new insights into the biology and gene regulation of animal genomes including the human. We foresee four central roles for the DAC, and have organized our aims around them. Aim 1: We will provide common computational guidelines for data processing in fly and worm, a common computational infrastructure and pipeline for common analysis and statistical tasks. Aim 2: We will facilitate and carry out element-specific integrative analyses to identify diverse classes of functional elements based on combinations of relevant datasets coming from multiple groups. This includes (a) enhancers, promoters, insulators, and other regions of regulatory importance, (b) protein-coding and non-coding genes, (c) regulatory networks of transcription factor and microRNA targeting, and (d) sequence features predictive of diverse classes of functional elements. Aim 3: We will carry out exploratory data analyses across different data types to discover potentially novel correlations and insights relating diverse classes of elements. In particular we will apply dimensionality reduction techniques to coordinate-based genome-wide genomic and epigenomic datasets, we will apply clustering and bi-clustering methods to identify functionally related sets of genes and modules, and we will analyze structural and dynamic properties of discovered networks. Aim 4: We will carry out comparative analyses across the two model organisms, and also with yeast and human. We will provide an ortholog resource between the species, compare regulatory relationships and dynamics for orthologous cell lines and developmental points, and carry over biological knowledge across model organisms and human. To achieve these four aims, we will work closely with members of the consortium, the modENCODE Analysis Working Group (AWG), consisting of all Principal Investigators and analysis groups, and the Data Coordination Center (DCC), responsible for all data sharing within the consortium and with the larger worm and fly communities.

"Arabidopsis N-regulatory network dynamics: Integrating metabolome & transcriptome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed research is to use a systems biology approach to collectively analyze and integrate time-dependent data from the transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome components of the N- regulatory network controlling N-assimilation in Arabidopsis. This integrative approach will allow us to dynamically model the flow of N-signal propagation through the N-regulatory network on a systems-wide level and identify the transcriptional cascade involved in this regulation. This goal will be achieved through four aims: 1. Creation of high-resolution dynamic transcriptome datasets to generate a time-dependent nitrogen regulatory network, by performing microarray analysis on Arabidopsis roots and shoots treated with nitrate over a time course. 2. Quantification of metabolite levels and metabolic flux in the N-assimilatory network in response to N-signal, using stable isotope labeled N15 over a time course. 3. Integration of transcriptome, metabolome, and fluxome data to create a time-dependent dynamic network model for the control of N- uptake/assimilation, using a series of analytical techniques including lag correlation, linear regression, and machine learning (state space analysis). 4. Functional validation of regulatory network predictions by testing model generated hypotheses with T-DNA mutants and inducible expression systems. The overriding hypothesis being tested is that inorganic-N signals (nitrate) activate motifs involved in regulating nitrate uptake, reduction and assimilation into organic-N (Glu/Gln), used for biosynthetic reactions. The organic-N products (Glu/Gln) in turn activate motifs controlling Asn synthesized for N-storage, and repress ones controlling N- uptake/assimilation. The proposed research will allow me to identify the regulatory genes responding to these inorganic and organic N-signals that regulate genes in the N-uptake and assimilation pathways by integrating genome wide transcriptomic data with metabolomic data.

"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism.

To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation.

"Genetics Variants in the Genome Predisposing to Aggressive PCa DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fortunately, most men diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) will not die from their disease, and some men diagnosed may not even require treatment for their cancers. However, on the other end of the spectrum, ~30,000 men annually die from PCa in the US alone. For these latter men, the concept of PCa as an indolent disease obviously does not apply. Understanding the molecular basis of aggressive PCa (aPCa) vs. indolent PCa (non-aPCa) is perhaps the most important basic, yet translational question in PCa biology. We hypothesize that multiple sequence variants in the genome confer risk to aPCa but not to non-aPCa. Taking advantage of the publicly available CGEMS genome wide association data, as well as the large and unique PCa patient population at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH), we propose a systematic genetic association study to confirm, fine map, and better characterize genetic risk variants for aPCa. We propose three specific aims: 1)Test the genetic variants implicated in the CGEMS study that distinguish aPCa from non-aPCa among ~3,000 aPCa and ~5,000 non-aPCa patients of European ancestry from the JHH, 2) Fine map the genomic regions for the SNPs implicated in Aim 1 among 3,000 aPCa and 5,000 non-aPCa patients of European ancestry from the JHH, and 3) Assess the association of the most significant SNPs found in Aim 2 with disease characteristics in all 8,000 patients, and with disease progression in a subset of patients that have follow-up data at JHH. In addition, we have two exploratory aims: 1) fine mapping of regions containing SNPs significant in European Americans in aPCa and non-aPCa in African Americans, and 2) testing for gene-gene interaction. Besides the obvious clues that the proposed research may provide in terms of etiologic mechanisms, this study may also lead to identification of new target genes and proteins for therapy and possible preventive strategies. Furthermore, the identification of multiple variants can lead to the development of a test panel that may improve prediction of aPCa risk. Project Narrative  Prostate cancer is a common cancer that varies widely in its aggressiveness. The ability to predict which men  are at risk for the development of aggressive prostate cancer is urgently needed. This proposal addresses the  possibility that genetic variants may differentiate risk for aggressive from non-aggressive prostate cancer and  the results can be used to predict men at higher risk for aggressive prostate cancer.",Genetics Variants in the Genome Predisposing to Aggressive PCa,8037735,R01CA133009,"['forest ', ' sharing data ', ' genetic association ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' 17q24.3

"Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in disease genomes or across population. The next great challenge is to elucidate the potential function of various genetic variants in biological an disease processes. An important type of functional variants consists of those that affect gene expression in cis. Indeed, cis-regulatory variants are involved in a broad range of diseases and they showed a consistently stronger influence on gene expression than trans-acting determinants. Alternative splicing is an essential mechanism via which cis-regulatory changes may occur. Previous studies estimated that 15- 60% of point mutations that result in human genetic diseases disrupt splicing, highlighting the importance of this regulatory step. In addition to the well-known splice site signals, splicing is closely regulated by many exonic or intronic cis elements, associated with trans-acting proteins. Disruption of these cis-regulatory elements can cause aberrant splicing. Yet this crucial regulatory aspect remains largely unexplored. We propose to combine computational, genomic and molecular approaches to study splicing changes due to genetic variations. The specific aims are: (1) To globally identify exons and genes that are under differential splicing regulation by the alternative alleles of genetic variant, via bioinformatic analysis of high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome profiles (RNA-Seq). (2) To identify causal genetic variants in splicing alteration using minigene-based experiments. (3) To develop an integrative model to predict causal genetic variants in splicing alteration, using machine learning approaches, RNA- Seq data and molecular validations. This project will elucidate functional cis-regulatory genetic variants in splicing and provide significant insight ino the involvement of genetic variations in human diseases. In addition, this work will generate valuable bioinformatic tools to make full use of the increasingly available RNA-Seq data in a wide variety of cell types for identification and prediction of disease-related genetic variants.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aberrant splicing can significantly alter gene expression and contribute to human diseases. The proposed research aims to gain a systematic understanding of the functional roles of genetic variations (e.g., mutations or polymorphisms) in the regulation of splicing. This work will provide mechanistic basis for how genetic variations may contribute to diseases, such that future interventions can target specific splicing events therapeutically.                      Aberrant splicing can significantly alter gene expression and contribute to human diseases.

The organic-N products (Glu/Gln) in turn activate motifs controlling Asn synthesized for N-storage, and repress ones controlling N- uptake/assimilation. The proposed research will allow me to identify the regulatory genes responding to these inorganic and organic N-signals that regulate genes in the N-uptake and assimilation pathways by integrating genome wide transcriptomic data with metabolomic data. The synthesis of these aims should allow for modeling, predicting and testing how perturbations of the ""system"" may be used to enhance N-use efficiency, which impacts energy-use (fertilizers/biofuels), nitrate contamination of the environment and human nutrition. Project Narrative  The long-term goal of the systems approach described in this proposal is to model and predictively manipulate gene regulatory networks affecting uptake/assimilation of inorganic nitrogen into amino acids to improve nitrogen-use-efficiency. This would decrease energy consumption, reduce ground water contamination by nitrates (Health and Environment) and improve seed yield, with implications for human health (Nutrition) and biofuels (Energy). Moreover, the systems biology approach and the tools that will be developed in this project can be applied to any species for which genome data is available, which will enable researchers to model and manipulate a broad spectrum of regulatory circuits in biology with potential medical and pharmaceutical applications.",Arabidopsis N-regulatory network dynamics: Integrating metabolome & transcriptome,8309335,F32GM095273,"['Affect ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Biology ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Environment ', ' Enzymes ', ' Fertilizers ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Q.

"Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How cell-type specific gene expression programs are established and maintained is a fundamental question in molecular biology. In mammalian cells, hundreds of sequence-specific transcription factors have been catalogued, and they bind the regulatory regions of their target genes in cell-type specific and combinatorial occupancy patterns. Moreover, the developmental programs that generate different cell lineages are accompanied by complex chromatin remodeling. Increasing evidence suggests that the regulatory regions of cell-type specific genes may often be established and sometimes ""poised"" by chromatin marks at earlier stages in development. However, the detailed characterization of gene regulatory regions-including their initial establishment in earlier progenitor cells, the dynamics of their chromatin state, and the combinatorial control of gene transcriptional output by multiple transcription factors-has only been studied for a handful of developmentally important genes.  The goal of this project is to develop new integrative computational methods that exploit massive next- generation sequencing data sets to fundamentally advance our understanding of cell-type specific transcriptional programs. We will develop integrative computational analysis methods for (1) learning the sequence and chromatin determinants of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq; (2) mapping the landscape of chromatin accessibility of all regulatory regions in the human and mouse genomes using DNase-seq across all available cell types, dissecting the poising of their chromatin state in earlier progenitor cells, and extracting the sequence code governing their gain and loss in differentiation; and (3) modeling cell-type specific gene expression programs as a function of chromatin state, transcription factor binding, and regulatory sequence analysis. We will couple our computational methods development with targeted experimental validation, including both locus-specific and genome-wide assays. Understanding gene regulation is fundamental to the study of normal cellular processes as well as disease.

"Linking disease-associated variants to transcriptional regulation using ENCODE     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 3000 loci associated with common disease, the mechanism by which variation at these loci are pathogenic remains unclear. The ENCODE project provides a unique resource of extensive functional genomic data that can be used to close this knowledge gap. The overall objective of this application is to develop computational methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with GWAS data to predict simultaneously the relevant tissue type and functionally important variants for a given disease. A secondary objective is to validate these approaches through the analysis of data on cancer and autoimmune disease. The central hypothesis is that loci identified through GWAS tag functional SNPs that cause disease by altering transcription factor binding sites, thereby dysregulating genes in the relevant tissue typ (e.g. pre-neoplastic tissue for cancer and immune cells for autoimmune disease). The rationale that underlies this research is that the ENCODE data represents a rich resource for understanding GWAS results and that the methods to be developed here will enable similar analysis on other diseases. The research team is well prepared to undertake the proposed research because of their combined expertise in the conduct and analysis of GWAS, functional and bioinformatics follow-up of GWAS hits, and machine learning approaches to understanding genome-scale data including transcription factor binding. The central hypothesis will be tested through these aims: 1) Determine if ENCODE data generated in the appropriate tissue type can be used to find putative functional transcriptional regulatory variants at disease-associated loci. This will be achieved by asking if lymphoma risk SNPs tend to alter transcription factor binding sites and associate with expression of nearby genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines. 2) Using ENCODE data, identify the cell types and tissue(s) important for a given disease. Relevant cell types will be identified by determining those cell types in which genes are more likely to be expressed near disease risk loci in the ENCODE data. 3) Identify putative functional SNPs in GWAS using ENCODE when complete functional genomic data is not available for the appropriate tissue type. To extend these analyses beyond the few cell types extensively studied in ENCODE, DNase hypersensitivity data from the relevant tissue will be linked with ChIP-Seq transcription factor binding data from other tissues to allow identification of variants that alter transcription factor binding. This research is significant because it will provide new insight into the biology of cancer and autoimmune disease. More importantly, it will provide the tools necessary to use the ENCODE data to link disease risk loci with functional variants and potential mechanistic explanations.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Over the past five years, numerous genetic changes associated with common disease have been identified.

"Methods for high-resolution analysis of genetic effects on gene expression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Summary Gene expression is a fundamental function of any cell. It is the main mechanism by which information is transmitted from the nucleus to the rest of the cell and eventually to other cells and the body of the organism. Genetic variation in components of the transcriptional machinery and signals that regulate gene function generates variation in transcriptional response and consequently variation in phenotypes. It has become apparent that many of the common genetic signals associated with disease are found away from the DNA sequence that encodes for protein sequence and is likely to be functioning in regulating gene expression. In this project we propose to develop methodologies that will explore the consequences of genetic variation in gene expression. There are three main goals of this project. First we will explore and develop methodologies to mine information from experiments that perform deep sequencing of the human transcriptome. The new sequencing technologies are providing us with unprecedented resolution into the transcriptome but are also raising challenges in the computational and biological models to use to interpret such large amounts of data. Secondly, we will use high-resolution genetic data to develop and use methodologies to dissect the fine structure of genetic variants that affect regulation of gene expression. Finally, we will implement and test models to infer the higher-order interactions of genome function so as to dig deeply into the biological consequences of genetic variants and how the signal is transmitted from the DNA sequence to higher levels of cell and body function. Our goals is to develop methodologies that will significantly improve our insight to the variability in human populations and assist in interpreting predisposition to genetic diseases.

"Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia  Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which degeneration of language regions in the dominant hemisphere is associated with progressive deficits in speech and/or language function. The overall goals of this project are to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural changes underlying linguistic deficits in PPA, and to use this information to better discriminate patients with variants of PPA from each other and from normal aging. Recent studies have identified three clinical variants of PPA: progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Each variant is associated with characteristic linguistic features, distinct patterns of brain atrophy, and different likelihoods of particular underlying pathogenic processes, making correct differential diagnosis highly relevant. We will recruit 48 patients with PPA (16 of each variant) and 24 normal controls over a three year period, and acquire fMRI data along with structural MRI, linguistic and cognitive measures. The fMRI paradigm consists of a syntactic processing task with seven conditions parametrically varying in syntactic complexity. The research will address two specific aims. The first is to identify the relationships between volume loss, changes in functional MRI activation, and linguistic deficits, in the different PPA variants. The second aim is to improve differential diagnosis of PPA variants using machine learning algorithms incorporating both structural and functional imaging measures.  PPA is a devastating disorder that prevents individuals from communicating and functioning in society. The knowledge gained in this study will increase our understanding of the neural basis of language processing and its breakdown in PPA, and will contribute to earlier, more accurate differential diagnosis of PPA variants, enabling emerging therapies to be targeted to likely underlying etiologies.",Functional neuroimaging of language processing in primary progressive aphasia,8247172,R03DC010878,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Logasthenia ', ' Logamnesia ', ' Logagnosia ', ' Aphasias ', ' Anepia ', ' Alogia ', ' Aphasia ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' frontal cortex ', ' frontal lobe ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' Speech ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Syndrome ', ' Taxes ', ' temporal lobe/cortex ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Functional Aphasias ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' Individual ', ' Agrammatism ', ' Funding ', ' Mesulam Syndrome ', ' Primary Progressive Aphasia ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' frontotemporal lobar dementia ', ' Frontotemporal Dementia ', ' Progressive Aphasias ', ' Semantic Dementias ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Inferior ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Funding Source ', ' Funding Agency ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' language processing ', ' lexical ', ' neuropsychological ', ' normal aging ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R03,2012,121968,0.017932559228635504
"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the  outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and  interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but  also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations  we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view  of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to  disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.",Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu,8251157,R01GM087694,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cells ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Haplotypes ', ' In element ', ' Indium ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plastics ', ' Recombination ', ' DNA recombination (naturally occurring) ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Lasso ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Individual ', ' Descriptor ', ' gene function ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Study Subject ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' linkage analyses ', ' genetic linkage analyses ', ' family based linkage study ', ' Linkage Analysis ', ' genetic linkage analysis ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Genomics ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecuar profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Transcript ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' data integration ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' phenome ', ' ']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,477069,0.04280814151577329
"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2. The Working Groups formed in Aim 1 will establish criteria and oversee curators vetting variants. We will develop and optimize disease- and gene-specific machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid classification of variants based on data provided by genetic testing services via ClinVar. We will integrate population-genetic data inferred from at least 25 reference populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and other large endeavors into our machine learning approaches so as to infer the global relevance of CRVs discovered here.

"Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How cell-type specific gene expression programs are established and maintained is a fundamental question in molecular biology. In mammalian cells, hundreds of sequence-specific transcription factors have been catalogued, and they bind the regulatory regions of their target genes in cell-type specific and combinatorial occupancy patterns. Moreover, the developmental programs that generate different cell lineages are accompanied by complex chromatin remodeling. Increasing evidence suggests that the regulatory regions of cell-type specific genes may often be established and sometimes ""poised"" by chromatin marks at earlier stages in development. However, the detailed characterization of gene regulatory regions-including their initial establishment in earlier progenitor cells, the dynamics of their chromatin state, and the combinatorial control of gene transcriptional output by multiple transcription factors-has only been studied for a handful of developmentally important genes.  The goal of this project is to develop new integrative computational methods that exploit massive next- generation sequencing data sets to fundamentally advance our understanding of cell-type specific transcriptional programs. We will develop integrative computational analysis methods for (1) learning the sequence and chromatin determinants of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq; (2) mapping the landscape of chromatin accessibility of all regulatory regions in the human and mouse genomes using DNase-seq across all available cell types, dissecting the poising of their chromatin state in earlier progenitor cells, and extracting the sequence code governing their gain and loss in differentiation; and (3) modeling cell-type specific gene expression programs as a function of chromatin state, transcription factor binding, and regulatory sequence analysis. We will couple our computational methods development with targeted experimental validation, including both locus-specific and genome-wide assays. Understanding gene regulation is fundamental to the study of normal cellular processes as well as disease. In this project, we develop computational methods to exploit multiple sources of large-scale genomics data enabled by next-generation sequencing technology in order to provide new tools for studying gene regulation in mammalian cells.",Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs,8463019,R01HG006798,"['Algorithms ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cataloging ', ' Cell Extracts ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' DNase ', ' DNA Nucleases ', ' Deoxyribonucleases ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Goals ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' Histones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Protein Methylation ', ' Methylation ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Reading ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions, Nucleic Acid (Genetics) ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stem cells ', ' Technology ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' hydrosulfite ', ' hydrogen sulfite ', ' bisulfite ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Lasso ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Training ', ' Hematopoietic ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' preference ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' Genomics ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' histone modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Chromatin Remodeling Complex ', ' Chromatin Remodeling Factor ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecuar profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' computational analysis ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' epigenomics ', ' data modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' transcriptomics ', ' combinatorial ', ' sequence learning ', ' mouse genome ', ' multi-task ', ' multitask ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' Chip sequencing ', ' Chip seq ', ' RNA-seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' ']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2013,493524,0.03589198676193234
"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases.

"Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in disease genomes or across population. The next great challenge is to elucidate the potential function of various genetic variants in biological an disease processes. An important type of functional variants consists of those that affect gene expression in cis. Indeed, cis-regulatory variants are involved in a broad range of diseases and they showed a consistently stronger influence on gene expression than trans-acting determinants. Alternative splicing is an essential mechanism via which cis-regulatory changes may occur. Previous studies estimated that 15- 60% of point mutations that result in human genetic diseases disrupt splicing, highlighting the importance of this regulatory step. In addition to the well-known splice site signals, splicing is closely regulated by many exonic or intronic cis elements, associated with trans-acting proteins. Disruption of these cis-regulatory elements can cause aberrant splicing. Yet this crucial regulatory aspect remains largely unexplored. We propose to combine computational, genomic and molecular approaches to study splicing changes due to genetic variations. The specific aims are: (1) To globally identify exons and genes that are under differential splicing regulation by the alternative alleles of genetic variant, via bioinformatic analysis of high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome profiles (RNA-Seq). (2) To identify causal genetic variants in splicing alteration using minigene-based experiments. (3) To develop an integrative model to predict causal genetic variants in splicing alteration, using machine learning approaches, RNA- Seq data and molecular validations. This project will elucidate functional cis-regulatory genetic variants in splicing and provide significant insight ino the involvement of genetic variations in human diseases. In addition, this work will generate valuable bioinformatic tools to make full use of the increasingly available RNA-Seq data in a wide variety of cell types for identification and prediction of disease-related genetic variants.          Aberrant splicing can significantly alter gene expression and contribute to human diseases. The proposed research aims to gain a systematic understanding of the functional roles of genetic variations (e.g., mutations or polymorphisms) in the regulation of splicing. This work will provide mechanistic basis for how genetic variations may contribute to diseases, such that future interventions can target specific splicing events therapeutically.

"Linking disease-associated variants to transcriptional regulation using ENCODE     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 3000 loci associated with common disease, the mechanism by which variation at these loci are pathogenic remains unclear. The ENCODE project provides a unique resource of extensive functional genomic data that can be used to close this knowledge gap. The overall objective of this application is to develop computational methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with GWAS data to predict simultaneously the relevant tissue type and functionally important variants for a given disease. A secondary objective is to validate these approaches through the analysis of data on cancer and autoimmune disease. The central hypothesis is that loci identified through GWAS tag functional SNPs that cause disease by altering transcription factor binding sites, thereby dysregulating genes in the relevant tissue typ (e.g. pre-neoplastic tissue for cancer and immune cells for autoimmune disease). The rationale that underlies this research is that the ENCODE data represents a rich resource for understanding GWAS results and that the methods to be developed here will enable similar analysis on other diseases. The research team is well prepared to undertake the proposed research because of their combined expertise in the conduct and analysis of GWAS, functional and bioinformatics follow-up of GWAS hits, and machine learning approaches to understanding genome-scale data including transcription factor binding. The central hypothesis will be tested through these aims: 1) Determine if ENCODE data generated in the appropriate tissue type can be used to find putative functional transcriptional regulatory variants at disease-associated loci. This will be achieved by asking if lymphoma risk SNPs tend to alter transcription factor binding sites and associate with expression of nearby genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines. 2) Using ENCODE data, identify the cell types and tissue(s) important for a given disease. Relevant cell types will be identified by determining those cell types in which genes are more likely to be expressed near disease risk loci in the ENCODE data. 3) Identify putative functional SNPs in GWAS using ENCODE when complete functional genomic data is not available for the appropriate tissue type. To extend these analyses beyond the few cell types extensively studied in ENCODE, DNase hypersensitivity data from the relevant tissue will be linked with ChIP-Seq transcription factor binding data from other tissues to allow identification of variants that alter transcription factor binding. This research is significant because it will provide new insight into the biology of cancer and autoimmune disease. More importantly, it will provide the tools necessary to use the ENCODE data to link disease risk loci with functional variants and potential mechanistic explanations.           Over the past five years, numerous genetic changes associated with common disease have been identified. The next step to use this information to improve human health is to determine how these changes alter cellular function. Here, methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with these genetic studies are proposed to enable investigators to generate hypotheses regarding the function of these genetic changes.

Regulatory elements are much more difficult to identify than genes and likely account for more variation among individuals than actual coding differences in genes. Identifying and studying elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, will lead to new therapeutic strategies as the complex regulatory networks are revealed. Up to now the characterization and validation of truly functional regulatory elements has been a low throughput endeavor as each regulatory site is cloned into a reporter assay and tested. This proposal produces a novel method that performs one of the most common validation assays, transient transfections, in a high-throughput manner by combining it with an innovative sorting and sequencing system. This system, which has been shown to be practical and feasible, will allow for rapid and thorough identification of the method of action of regulatory elements throughout the human genome.  The candidate's background in both computer science and molecular biology ranging from undergraduate to graduate school and post-doctoral work provides a complete background that should allow for implementation and extension of the described experiment in the post-doctoral environment. The nature of the science and the data produced should allow continuation and extension of the work as a new faculty member. Stanford and the Snyder lab provide an outstanding environment for a strong program allowing development of the candidate and preparation for transition to a long-term independent research career. As part of this program, the candidate will combine a mentoring committee with continuing education via available online courses.  The end result of both phases of the program will be scientific results that can be extended into useful and important medically and scientifically relevant areas as they relate to regulation of expression in humans. The innovative methods described will allow the candidate to pursue various lines of endeavor well past the end of this funding program. In turn the candidate will be positioned at the end of the program to function as an independent principle investigator and valuable collaborator.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to extend current assays demonstrating function of genomic regions into an equivalent genome-wide assay. Identification of the effect of these regions on gene expression will lead to a better understanding of the complex regulatory 'code' dictating our cellular processes.

"Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The whole genome sequencing of large cohorts of individuals is quickly becoming a common tool for researchers to investigate the genetic basis of many disease phenotypes. The primary goals are to discover the underlying genetic variation that cause or contribute to these diseases as well as to correctly identify these variants in a diagnostic setting. These differences typicall consist of single base changes (SNPs), but can also encompass larger, more complex chromosomal rearrangements in the form of structural variation (SV) which are much more difficult to detect even with modern sequencing technologies. A number of approaches have been published that have studied this problem, but even the largest scale endeavors have only focused on deletion events and reported a sensitivity of <70%. Complex chromosomal rearrangements are even less well studied. Thus, it is paramount that accurate methods are developed which can detect all types of SVs at high specificity from sequence data. This proposal aims to improve the overall ability of researchers to identify and analyze genetic variation from whole genome sequences. An important, and often overlooked, aspect of SV discovery is the fact that typical paired-end, read depth, and split read approaches will identify different sets of non-overlapping variants at varying degrees of accuracy. In Aim 1, we will develop a unified SV discovery algorithm that can incorporate all of these different sources of information in a probabilistic fashion. Such a method would be useful for research, in particular with the identification of rare variants, as well as clinical applications which require a great del of accuracy and have thus far been limited to older karyotyping and microarray approaches. This would identify the majority of structural variants, however there are many regions in genomic sequences which are complex in nature, defined as consisting of multiple neighboring or overlapping chromosomal rearrangements that are challenging to resolve with typical SV detection approaches. In Aim 2, we propose methods to resolve these complex regions and assess their frequency and impact. Furthermore, a crucial step in medical genetics is the comparison of identified genetic mutations to databases of known pathogenic and benign variants. This is currently problematic with SVs, as they have often been originally reported with varying degrees of breakpoint resolution that can hamper the correct assignment of the variant. This issue is compounded further in more complex regions with multiple breakpoints, for which simplistic comparison methods do not work well. In Aim 3, we will develop and implement a system that describes and utilizes variant profiles to identify whether an individual's sequence data contains a variant of interest. Overall, this project will advance our understanding of the human genome as well as provide tools for use in the general research and clinical communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The rearrangement of chromosomal material in the form of structural variation is directly responsible for many disease phenotypes, however our ability to detect and resolve these events from whole genome sequence data is currently limited. We propose a number of strategies for improving the detection and analysis of structural genomic variation between individuals and resolving their underlying structure and function. These approaches will have direct application to the clinical diagnosis of such events and the future of personalized genomics.            ",Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences,8528145,R01HG007068,"['Algorithms ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Communities ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Karyotyping Genetics ', ' Karyotyping ', ' Karyotype determination procedure ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Seeds ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' structural genomics ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Rearrangement ', ' DNA Sequence Rearrangement ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Chromosomal Rearrangement ', ' disease phenotype ', ' genetic variant ', ' virtual ', ' markov model ', ' Population ', ' direct application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2013,382699,0.16691120511238977
"Mechanisms underlying complex trait human disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now an explosion of new genome scale data relating genetic variation within the human population to phenotype, and particularly to common disease. Microarray technology has identified 100s of loci where the presence of particular variants is associated with altered risk of many common diseases; complete sequencing of individual exomes in cancer samples has discovered many somatic mutations in a variety of genes; and sequencing of 1000 human genomes has provided an almost complete inventory of common population variants. Further, these data are only the first in an ever-increasing flood, as even faster and cheaper sequencing technologies come on line. The results hold promise for major advances in treatment and diagnosis of common human diseases. Extracting the expected benefits is not straightforward, and will necessitate acquiring detailed knowledge of the mechanisms linking genetic variation to disease. This project focuses on one aspect of this challenge - using the new genomic data to identify new therapeutic opportunities. We will investigate those principles underlying complex trait disease that are particularly relevant to tha goal. We introduce a three stage mechanistic framework, relating genomic variation to the function of impacted gene products, the impact of these altered functions on pathways, processes and subsystems; and finally the consequences for complex trait disease phenotypes. We will develop computational methods to address key questions concerning three major aspects of the framework (1) How large are the changes in protein function brought about by the genomic variants underlying complex trait disease? What role do different classes of genomic and protein level mechanism, such as expression, non-synonymous changes and splicing, play in these variants? (2) How complete is the set genes with strong influence on the disease phenotypes discovered by current technologies, and how can missing genes be imputed from the genomic and network data? (3) What is the distribution of coupling between the activity of genes involved in disease mechanism and disease phenotypes? The results will deepen understanding of these aspects of complex disease, and provide a basis for identifying potential new drug targets from GWAS and other genomic studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies are now providing extensive information on human genetic variation associated with increased risk of a wide range of common human disease, such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers. These data hold the promise for the development of new therapies, and realizing those benefits requires the acquisition of complementary knowledge of the mechanisms that link genetic variation to disease risk.

"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.

"Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex sensory and signaling pathways ultimately converge on the DNA in the form of complexes of interacting regulatory RNAs and proteins that bind specific gene-proximal and distal regulatory elements to active and repress genes resulting in the establishment and maintenance of cell-type specific transcriptional responses. These regulatory elements have static and dynamic components - the former encoded in the genomic sequence itself as combinations of transcription factor binding site sequence motifs and the latter a consequence of locus and cell-type specific chromatin accessibility and epigenomic modifications as well as the dynamic linking of distal regulatory elements to target genes. In addition, transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback and control of the levels of regulatory proteins and RNAs also play a key role in dynamic cell-type specific gene regulation. One of the central challenges in modern genomics is to learn these rules by which the genome and epigenome encode regulatory information. How does a single genome sequence encode the information for exquisitely precise, and yet highly distinctive programs of gene regulation for different cell types, and at different time points? What are the key sequence determinants, and grammatical rules that determine the function of any given DNA sequence under any particular set of conditions? In this project we seek to use public data from The Roadmap Epigenomics project and The ENCODE project to make progress on these questions. We propose to build methods for interpreting shared and distinctive regulatory features, including especially transcription factor binding, across related cell types. In parallel, we will implement novel methods for identifying high-resolution, context-specific dynamic regulatory elements, decipher their underlying regulatory sequence grammars and learn predictive, integrative models of transcriptional regulation to decipher the effects of heterogeneous regulatory components on lineage-specific gene expression dynamics and provide regulatory annotations for large collections of curated and disease-associated gene sets.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop powerful statistical methods to study cell-type specific gene regulation, and apply these to publicly available data from The Roadmap Epigenomics Project, The ENCODE Project and several publicly available gene expression compendia.

"Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical genetic testing has become standard-of-care for many diseases including hundreds of inherited conditions. However, interpreting genetic test results is often confounded by the discovery of 'variants of unknown significance' (VUS) for which there is insufficient data or inadequate predictive tools to establish whether or not a particular variant predisposes to a disease. This problem is particularly vexing for genetic disorders with strong allelic heterogeneity and a preponderance of 'private' mutations such as the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), which predisposes young adults and children to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias. With the anticipated incorporation of personal exome or genome data into routine clinical care, interpreting VUS will become an even greater challenge especially when variants in genes associated with human disorders are incidentally discovered. Unfortunately, there are no reliable methods to predict a priori whether a given variant predisposes an individual to a particular disorder or whether the change is merely a benign rare variant. We propose to develop a novel paradigm for distinguishing disease-causing mutations from benign variants in LQTS as a model for other inherited arrhythmia syndromes and channelopathies. We will focus on variants in KCNQ1, the most commonly mutated gene in LQTS. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a holistic predictive model that relates experimentally determined protein structure and dynamics to function and disease is highly accurate even for novel variants. Our ultimate objectives are to develop a data-trained, web-accessible algorithm that classifies VUS discovered in KCNQ1 based on reliable predictions of the structure and dynamics of the affected protein, and to achieve prediction accuracy to levels needed to inform medical decisions. The medical importance of correctly classifying KCNQ1 variants provides strong justification for having a dedicated and highly-tailored gene-specific prediction model. The ability to distinguish deleterious from neutral variants would help avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in carriers of benign alleles, and save the lives of those with true mutations. We propose to collect extensive electrophysiological, biochemical and structural data on a large set of KCNQ1 variants discovered in LQTS subjects as well as several suspected benign or neutral variants (Aims 1-2), then use these data to iteratively train and validate a machine learning based algorithm that can differentiate benign from deleterious KCNQ1 alleles among a set of new VUS (Aim 3). Our proposal is innovative in the use of a multidisciplinary approach to functionally and structurally annotate genomic variant data for a medically important gene at an unprecedented scale, and then to use these experimental findings to train/test a novel computational system to achieve clinical-grade predictions. Targeting KCNQ1 will also validate an approach for parallel work that can be utilized to predict the medical significance of variants in closely related potassium channels associated with heritable epilepsy (KCNQ2, KCNQ3) or deafness (KCNQ4).          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a cause of sudden cardiac death in children and young adults. We propose a multidisciplinary experimental approach including electrophysiology, biochemistry and structural biology deployed on a large scale to generate information on at least 110 genetic variants in the main gene responsible for LQTS (KCNQ1), which encodes a potassium channel required for normal electrical activity in the heart. Our final product will be a data-trained computational strategy that will outperform existing methods for accurately predicting the functional consequences of novel KCNQ1 genetic variants, enhance the value of genetic testing in LQTS and provide for more informed medical decisions.                ",Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome,8786636,R01HL122010,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' arrhythmic agent ', ' antiarrhythmic agent ', ' Antiarrhythmic Drugs ', ' Antiarrhythmia Drugs ', ' Antiarrhythmia Agents ', ' Anti-Arrhythmics ', ' Anti-Arrhythmia Drugs ', ' Anti-Arrhythmia Agents ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biochemistry ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Deafness ', ' Sudden Death ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Long QT Syndrome ', ' Methods ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Potassium Ion Channels ', ' K channel ', ' Potassium Channel ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Death, Sudden, Cardiac ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Stimulators, Electrical, Cardiac, Shock ', ' Electric Shock Cardiac Stimulators ', ' Defibrillators ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' cardiac rhythm ', ' heart rhythm ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' structural biology ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Protein Trafficking ', ' protein transport ', ' trafficking ', ' Structure ', ' genetic testing ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Cell surface ', ' proband ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' genome sequencing ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' First Degree Relative ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Molecular ', ' Cardiac ', ' protein function ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Implant ', ' web-accessible ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2014,1308724,0.15683172488267214
"GWAS TO GENE FUNCTION: NOS1AP AND OTHER QT INTERVAL GENES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the electrographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait that impacts the risks of long QT syndrome and sudden cardiac death, have identified 68 independent variants at 35 loci, explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance. Nevertheless, the identity, function and mechanisms of action of the underlying DNA sequence variants and genes remain unknown, and are major impediments for understanding the molecular structure and functional architecture of this complex phenotype. We hypothesize that the majority of functional trait variants are polymorphic, non-coding and perturb transcription of a specific gene by altering the functions of their cis-regulatory elements. We propose a research paradigm for systematically identifying these non-coding trait variants, the regulatory functions they disrupt and the specific genes whose functions are altered at each quantitative trait locus. We will utilize integrative statisticl genetic, computational, molecular genetics and cellular approaches for elucidating the underlying mechanisms, using QT interval as a model 'system'. Our specific aims are: (1) to perform high- resolution mapping of GWAS signals to identify all polymorphic (>1%) and rare variants at loci that modulate the QT-interval; (2) to conduct in silico and in vitro analysis to predict and prioritize all cardiac regulatory (enhancer, silencer, insulator) elements and their cognate DNA-binding proteins; and, (3) to identify trait variants, genes and their mechanisms of genetic action. The overall goals are to improve the molecular genetic and mechanistic understanding of multifactorial traits for applications to other complex phenotypes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The electrocardiographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait for arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, has 68 predominantly non-coding variants at 35 loci explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance upon meta-analyses in >76,000 individuals of European and >11,000 individuals of African ancestry: nevertheless, the molecular details remain unknown.

"Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in disease genomes or across population. The next great challenge is to elucidate the potential function of various genetic variants in biological an disease processes. An important type of functional variants consists of those that affect gene expression in cis. Indeed, cis-regulatory variants are involved in a broad range of diseases and they showed a consistently stronger influence on gene expression than trans-acting determinants. Alternative splicing is an essential mechanism via which cis-regulatory changes may occur. Previous studies estimated that 15- 60% of point mutations that result in human genetic diseases disrupt splicing, highlighting the importance of this regulatory step. In addition to the well-known splice site signals, splicing is closely regulated by many exonic or intronic cis elements, associated with trans-acting proteins. Disruption of these cis-regulatory elements can cause aberrant splicing. Yet this crucial regulatory aspect remains largely unexplored. We propose to combine computational, genomic and molecular approaches to study splicing changes due to genetic variations. The specific aims are: (1) To globally identify exons and genes that are under differential splicing regulation by the alternative alleles of genetic variant, via bioinformatic analysis of high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome profiles (RNA-Seq). (2) To identify causal genetic variants in splicing alteration using minigene-based experiments. (3) To develop an integrative model to predict causal genetic variants in splicing alteration, using machine learning approaches, RNA- Seq data and molecular validations. This project will elucidate functional cis-regulatory genetic variants in splicing and provide significant insight ino the involvement of genetic variations in human diseases. In addition, this work will generate valuable bioinformatic tools to make full use of the increasingly available RNA-Seq data in a wide variety of cell types for identification and prediction of disease-related genetic variants.          Aberrant splicing can significantly alter gene expression and contribute to human diseases. The proposed research aims to gain a systematic understanding of the functional roles of genetic variations (e.g., mutations or polymorphisms) in the regulation of splicing. This work will provide mechanistic basis for how genetic variations may contribute to diseases, such that future interventions can target specific splicing events therapeutically.

"Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements Understanding of regulatory elements in the human genome is a key step in our ability to understand complex biological and disease systems. Regulatory elements are much more difficult to identify than genes and likely account for more variation among individuals than actual coding differences in genes. Identifying and studying elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, will lead to new therapeutic strategies as the complex regulatory networks are revealed. Up to now the characterization and validation of truly functional regulatory elements has been a low throughput endeavor as each regulatory site is cloned into a reporter assay and tested. This proposal produces a novel method that performs one of the most common validation assays, transient transfections, in a high-throughput manner by combining it with an innovative sorting and sequencing system. This system, which has been shown to be practical and feasible, will allow for rapid and thorough identification of the method of action of regulatory elements throughout the human genome.  The candidate's background in both computer science and molecular biology ranging from undergraduate to graduate school and post-doctoral work provides a complete background that should allow for implementation and extension of the described experiment in the post-doctoral environment. The nature of the science and the data produced should allow continuation and extension of the work as a new faculty member. Stanford and the Snyder lab provide an outstanding environment for a strong program allowing development of the candidate and preparation for transition to a long-term independent research career. As part of this program, the candidate will combine a mentoring committee with continuing education via available online courses.  The end result of both phases of the program will be scientific results that can be extended into useful and important medically and scientifically relevant areas as they relate to regulation of expression in humans. The innovative methods described will allow the candidate to pursue various lines of endeavor well past the end of this funding program. In turn the candidate will be positioned at the end of the program to function as an independent principle investigator and valuable collaborator. This project seeks to extend current assays demonstrating function of genomic regions into an equivalent genome-wide assay. Identification of the effect of these regions on gene expression will lead to a better understanding of the complex regulatory `code' dictating our cellular processes.

"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New evidence suggests that a previously-unknown form of cellular and metabolic regulation exits. This proposal seeks to investigate the functional importance of this regulatory mechanism and the role played by a group of enzymes that are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan.

"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2. The Working Groups formed in Aim 1 will establish criteria and oversee curators vetting variants. We will develop and optimize disease- and gene-specific machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid classification of variants based on data provided by genetic testing services via ClinVar. We will integrate population-genetic data inferred from at least 25 reference populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and other large endeavors into our machine learning approaches so as to infer the global relevance of CRVs discovered here.

"Mechanisms underlying complex trait human disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now an explosion of new genome scale data relating genetic variation within the human population to phenotype, and particularly to common disease. Microarray technology has identified 100s of loci where the presence of particular variants is associated with altered risk of many common diseases; complete sequencing of individual exomes in cancer samples has discovered many somatic mutations in a variety of genes; and sequencing of 1000 human genomes has provided an almost complete inventory of common population variants. Further, these data are only the first in an ever-increasing flood, as even faster and cheaper sequencing technologies come on line. The results hold promise for major advances in treatment and diagnosis of common human diseases. Extracting the expected benefits is not straightforward, and will necessitate acquiring detailed knowledge of the mechanisms linking genetic variation to disease. This project focuses on one aspect of this challenge - using the new genomic data to identify new therapeutic opportunities. We will investigate those principles underlying complex trait disease that are particularly relevant to tha goal. We introduce a three stage mechanistic framework, relating genomic variation to the function of impacted gene products, the impact of these altered functions on pathways, processes and subsystems; and finally the consequences for complex trait disease phenotypes. We will develop computational methods to address key questions concerning three major aspects of the framework (1) How large are the changes in protein function brought about by the genomic variants underlying complex trait disease? What role do different classes of genomic and protein level mechanism, such as expression, non-synonymous changes and splicing, play in these variants? (2) How complete is the set genes with strong influence on the disease phenotypes discovered by current technologies, and how can missing genes be imputed from the genomic and network data? (3) What is the distribution of coupling between the activity of genes involved in disease mechanism and disease phenotypes? The results will deepen understanding of these aspects of complex disease, and provide a basis for identifying potential new drug targets from GWAS and other genomic studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies are now providing extensive information on human genetic variation associated with increased risk of a wide range of common human disease, such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers.

"Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The whole genome sequencing of large cohorts of individuals is quickly becoming a common tool for researchers to investigate the genetic basis of many disease phenotypes. The primary goals are to discover the underlying genetic variation that cause or contribute to these diseases as well as to correctly identify these variants in a diagnostic setting. These differences typicall consist of single base changes (SNPs), but can also encompass larger, more complex chromosomal rearrangements in the form of structural variation (SV) which are much more difficult to detect even with modern sequencing technologies. A number of approaches have been published that have studied this problem, but even the largest scale endeavors have only focused on deletion events and reported a sensitivity of <70%. Complex chromosomal rearrangements are even less well studied. Thus, it is paramount that accurate methods are developed which can detect all types of SVs at high specificity from sequence data. This proposal aims to improve the overall ability of researchers to identify and analyze genetic variation from whole genome sequences. An important, and often overlooked, aspect of SV discovery is the fact that typical paired-end, read depth, and split read approaches will identify different sets of non-overlapping variants at varying degrees of accuracy. In Aim 1, we will develop a unified SV discovery algorithm that can incorporate all of these different sources of information in a probabilistic fashion. Such a method would be useful for research, in particular with the identification of rare variants, as well as clinical applications which require a great del of accuracy and have thus far been limited to older karyotyping and microarray approaches. This would identify the majority of structural variants, however there are many regions in genomic sequences which are complex in nature, defined as consisting of multiple neighboring or overlapping chromosomal rearrangements that are challenging to resolve with typical SV detection approaches. In Aim 2, we propose methods to resolve these complex regions and assess their frequency and impact. Furthermore, a crucial step in medical genetics is the comparison of identified genetic mutations to databases of known pathogenic and benign variants. This is currently problematic with SVs, as they have often been originally reported with varying degrees of breakpoint resolution that can hamper the correct assignment of the variant. This issue is compounded further in more complex regions with multiple breakpoints, for which simplistic comparison methods do not work well. In Aim 3, we will develop and implement a system that describes and utilizes variant profiles to identify whether an individual's sequence data contains a variant of interest. Overall, this project will advance our understanding of the human genome as well as provide tools for use in the general research and clinical communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The rearrangement of chromosomal material in the form of structural variation is directly responsible for many disease phenotypes, however our ability to detect and resolve these events from whole genome sequence data is currently limited. We propose a number of strategies for improving the detection and analysis of structural genomic variation between individuals and resolving their underlying structure and function. These approaches will have direct application to the clinical diagnosis of such events and the future of personalized genomics.

"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation.

"Integrative analysis tools to dissect cell-type specific transcriptional programs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How cell-type specific gene expression programs are established and maintained is a fundamental question in molecular biology. In mammalian cells, hundreds of sequence-specific transcription factors have been catalogued, and they bind the regulatory regions of their target genes in cell-type specific and combinatorial occupancy patterns. Moreover, the developmental programs that generate different cell lineages are accompanied by complex chromatin remodeling. Increasing evidence suggests that the regulatory regions of cell-type specific genes may often be established and sometimes ""poised"" by chromatin marks at earlier stages in development. However, the detailed characterization of gene regulatory regions-including their initial establishment in earlier progenitor cells, the dynamics of their chromatin state, and the combinatorial control of gene transcriptional output by multiple transcription factors-has only been studied for a handful of developmentally important genes.  The goal of this project is to develop new integrative computational methods that exploit massive next- generation sequencing data sets to fundamentally advance our understanding of cell-type specific transcriptional programs. We will develop integrative computational analysis methods for (1) learning the sequence and chromatin determinants of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq; (2) mapping the landscape of chromatin accessibility of all regulatory regions in the human and mouse genomes using DNase-seq across all available cell types, dissecting the poising of their chromatin state in earlier progenitor cells, and extracting the sequence code governing their gain and loss in differentiation; and (3) modeling cell-type specific gene expression programs as a function of chromatin state, transcription factor binding, and regulatory sequence analysis. We will couple our computational methods development with targeted experimental validation, including both locus-specific and genome-wide assays. Understanding gene regulation is fundamental to the study of normal cellular processes as well as disease.

"Linking disease-associated variants to transcriptional regulation using ENCODE     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 3000 loci associated with common disease, the mechanism by which variation at these loci are pathogenic remains unclear. The ENCODE project provides a unique resource of extensive functional genomic data that can be used to close this knowledge gap. The overall objective of this application is to develop computational methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with GWAS data to predict simultaneously the relevant tissue type and functionally important variants for a given disease. A secondary objective is to validate these approaches through the analysis of data on cancer and autoimmune disease. The central hypothesis is that loci identified through GWAS tag functional SNPs that cause disease by altering transcription factor binding sites, thereby dysregulating genes in the relevant tissue typ (e.g. pre-neoplastic tissue for cancer and immune cells for autoimmune disease). The rationale that underlies this research is that the ENCODE data represents a rich resource for understanding GWAS results and that the methods to be developed here will enable similar analysis on other diseases. The research team is well prepared to undertake the proposed research because of their combined expertise in the conduct and analysis of GWAS, functional and bioinformatics follow-up of GWAS hits, and machine learning approaches to understanding genome-scale data including transcription factor binding. The central hypothesis will be tested through these aims: 1) Determine if ENCODE data generated in the appropriate tissue type can be used to find putative functional transcriptional regulatory variants at disease-associated loci. This will be achieved by asking if lymphoma risk SNPs tend to alter transcription factor binding sites and associate with expression of nearby genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines. 2) Using ENCODE data, identify the cell types and tissue(s) important for a given disease. Relevant cell types will be identified by determining those cell types in which genes are more likely to be expressed near disease risk loci in the ENCODE data. 3) Identify putative functional SNPs in GWAS using ENCODE when complete functional genomic data is not available for the appropriate tissue type. To extend these analyses beyond the few cell types extensively studied in ENCODE, DNase hypersensitivity data from the relevant tissue will be linked with ChIP-Seq transcription factor binding data from other tissues to allow identification of variants that alter transcription factor binding. This research is significant because it will provide new insight into the biology of cancer and autoimmune disease. More importantly, it will provide the tools necessary to use the ENCODE data to link disease risk loci with functional variants and potential mechanistic explanations.           Over the past five years, numerous genetic changes associated with common disease have been identified. The next step to use this information to improve human health is to determine how these changes alter cellular function. Here, methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with these genetic studies are proposed to enable investigators to generate hypotheses regarding the function of these genetic changes.

"Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many complex disease syndromes consist of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical phenotypes. Differences between these syndromes involve the complex interplay of a large number of genomic variations that perturb the function of disease-related genes in the context of a regulatory network, rather than individually. Thus unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic, pleiotropic, and plastic interactions of elements and modules within and between the genome (G), transcriptome (T), and phenome (P). Most conventional methods focus on associations between every individual marker genotype and every single phenotype; they have limited statistical power and overlook the complex omit structures. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of structured associations between the ""-omes"". Rather than testing each SNP separately for association and then applying a correction by multiple hypothesis test, a structured association analysis identifies associations between groups of entities each with its own sophisticated structure that can not be ignored, such as blocks of SNPs with high LD, modules of genes in the same pathway, and clusters of phenotypes belong to a system of clinical descriptors of a disease. We will develop a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient machine learning platform and software to address the methodological challenges involved with unraveling the interplay between disease-relevant elements in the G, T, and P omes. Our technical innovations include novel statistical models and algorithms for haplotype inference, recombination hotspot detection, gene network and phenotype network inference, admixture association mapping, and most importantly, a family of new structured regression techniques such as the graph-regularized regression, graph- guided fused lasso and extensions, that perform functional approximations to the association functions among structural elements in the G, T, and P omes, and have provable guarantee on consistency and sparsistency. We envisage our proposed research will open a new paradigm for association studies of complex diseases, which facilitates: 1) Intra- and inter-omic integration of data for association mapping and disease gene/pathway discovery, 2) Thorough explorations of the internal structures within different omic data, so that cryptic associations that are not possibly detectable in unstructured analysis due to their weak statistical power can be now inferred. 3) Joint statistical inference of mechanisms and pathways of how variations in DNA lead to variations in complex traits flows through molecular networks, and inference of condition-specific state of gene function in the molecular networks, and 4) Development of faster and automated computational algorithm with greater scalability and robustness to large-scale inter-omic analysis, and more convenient software package and user interface. All the software tools will be made available for free to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of structured association mapping between disease-relevant elements in the genome,  transcriptome, and phenome. Since many complex diseases involve composite phenotypes that are the  outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular network underlying gene regulatory resulted from complex and  interdependent genome variations, structured association analysis at multi-omic level is not only needed, but  also necessary, but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations  we propose. Characterizing such interactions can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view  of complex diseases, which may lead to the identification of genes underlying disease processes; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to  disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers for multivariate clinical phenotypes.",Genome-Transcription-Phenome-Wide Association: a new paradigm for association stu,8656359,R01GM087694,"['Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cells ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Haplotypes ', ' In element ', ' Indium ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plastics ', ' Recombination ', ' DNA recombination (naturally occurring) ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Lasso ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Individual ', ' Descriptor ', ' gene function ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Study Subject ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' linkage analyses ', ' genetic linkage analyses ', ' family based linkage study ', ' Linkage Analysis ', ' genetic linkage analysis ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Genomics ', ' disease control ', ' disorder control ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Transcript ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' data integration ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' phenome ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' Statistics Algorithm ', ' Statistical Algorithm ', ' ']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,492794,0.04280814151577329
"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important.

"Statistical and computational analysis in whole genome sequencing studies.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will investigate several issues arising from the statistical and computational analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) based genomics studies. In the area of data management in WGS studies, we address the rapidly increasing cost associated with the transfer and storage of the massive files for the sequence reads and their associated quality scores. We will develop data compression methods to achieve a further compression of several folds beyond current standards, with minimal incurred errors. In the area of secondary analysis, we will develop new statistical learning methods to improve variant quality score recalibration and to filter out unreliable calls. This will improve te reliability of the key information provided by the WGS data, which are the variants calls indicating the locations where the genome differs from the reference and the nature of the differences. We will study methods for case-control studies based on WGS. In particular, we will develop statistical models to enable the integrating of information from multiple types of variants to obtain more powerful tests of association. We will apply the methods developed in this aim to the analysis of WGS data from a study on abdominal aortic aneurysm. Finally, we will address selected new questions associated with population scale WGS projects. Several national programs have recently been initiated to generate WGS data for hundreds of thousands of individuals with longitudinal medical records. The availability of this comprehensive data on a population scale will open up a rich frontier for genome medicine and will pose many new challenges for statistical analysis. We will formulate some of these new challenges and develop the statistical methods needed to meet these challenges.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research in this project concerns the design and implementation of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of data from whole genome sequencing studies.

"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important.

"Mechanisms underlying complex trait human disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now an explosion of new genome scale data relating genetic variation within the human population to phenotype, and particularly to common disease. Microarray technology has identified 100s of loci where the presence of particular variants is associated with altered risk of many common diseases; complete sequencing of individual exomes in cancer samples has discovered many somatic mutations in a variety of genes; and sequencing of 1000 human genomes has provided an almost complete inventory of common population variants. Further, these data are only the first in an ever-increasing flood, as even faster and cheaper sequencing technologies come on line. The results hold promise for major advances in treatment and diagnosis of common human diseases. Extracting the expected benefits is not straightforward, and will necessitate acquiring detailed knowledge of the mechanisms linking genetic variation to disease. This project focuses on one aspect of this challenge - using the new genomic data to identify new therapeutic opportunities. We will investigate those principles underlying complex trait disease that are particularly relevant to tha goal. We introduce a three stage mechanistic framework, relating genomic variation to the function of impacted gene products, the impact of these altered functions on pathways, processes and subsystems; and finally the consequences for complex trait disease phenotypes. We will develop computational methods to address key questions concerning three major aspects of the framework (1) How large are the changes in protein function brought about by the genomic variants underlying complex trait disease? What role do different classes of genomic and protein level mechanism, such as expression, non-synonymous changes and splicing, play in these variants? (2) How complete is the set genes with strong influence on the disease phenotypes discovered by current technologies, and how can missing genes be imputed from the genomic and network data? (3) What is the distribution of coupling between the activity of genes involved in disease mechanism and disease phenotypes? The results will deepen understanding of these aspects of complex disease, and provide a basis for identifying potential new drug targets from GWAS and other genomic studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies are now providing extensive information on human genetic variation associated with increased risk of a wide range of common human disease, such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers. These data hold the promise for the development of new therapies, and realizing those benefits requires the acquisition of complementary knowledge of the mechanisms that link genetic variation to disease risk.

"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2. The Working Groups formed in Aim 1 will establish criteria and oversee curators vetting variants. We will develop and optimize disease- and gene-specific machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid classification of variants based on data provided by genetic testing services via ClinVar.

"Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements Understanding of regulatory elements in the human genome is a key step in our ability to understand complex biological and disease systems. Regulatory elements are much more difficult to identify than genes and likely account for more variation among individuals than actual coding differences in genes. Identifying and studying elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, will lead to new therapeutic strategies as the complex regulatory networks are revealed. Up to now the characterization and validation of truly functional regulatory elements has been a low throughput endeavor as each regulatory site is cloned into a reporter assay and tested. This proposal produces a novel method that performs one of the most common validation assays, transient transfections, in a high-throughput manner by combining it with an innovative sorting and sequencing system. This system, which has been shown to be practical and feasible, will allow for rapid and thorough identification of the method of action of regulatory elements throughout the human genome.  The candidate's background in both computer science and molecular biology ranging from undergraduate to graduate school and post-doctoral work provides a complete background that should allow for implementation and extension of the described experiment in the post-doctoral environment. The nature of the science and the data produced should allow continuation and extension of the work as a new faculty member. Stanford and the Snyder lab provide an outstanding environment for a strong program allowing development of the candidate and preparation for transition to a long-term independent research career. As part of this program, the candidate will combine a mentoring committee with continuing education via available online courses.  The end result of both phases of the program will be scientific results that can be extended into useful and important medically and scientifically relevant areas as they relate to regulation of expression in humans. The innovative methods described will allow the candidate to pursue various lines of endeavor well past the end of this funding program. In turn the candidate will be positioned at the end of the program to function as an independent principle investigator and valuable collaborator. This project seeks to extend current assays demonstrating function of genomic regions into an equivalent genome-wide assay. Identification of the effect of these regions on gene expression will lead to a better understanding of the complex regulatory `code' dictating our cellular processes.

"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2. The Working Groups formed in Aim 1 will establish criteria and oversee curators vetting variants. We will develop and optimize disease- and gene-specific machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid classification of variants based on data provided by genetic testing services via ClinVar. We will integrate population-genetic data inferred from at least 25 reference populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and other large endeavors into our machine learning approaches so as to infer the global relevance of CRVs discovered here. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to create a unified, public, and freely available database of genetic alterations relevant to clinical care. Our ultimate goal is to empower clinicians, genetic counselors, and patients to make informed decisions based on DNA testing.

"Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex sensory and signaling pathways ultimately converge on the DNA in the form of complexes of interacting regulatory RNAs and proteins that bind specific gene-proximal and distal regulatory elements to active and repress genes resulting in the establishment and maintenance of cell-type specific transcriptional responses. These regulatory elements have static and dynamic components - the former encoded in the genomic sequence itself as combinations of transcription factor binding site sequence motifs and the latter a consequence of locus and cell-type specific chromatin accessibility and epigenomic modifications as well as the dynamic linking of distal regulatory elements to target genes. In addition, transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback and control of the levels of regulatory proteins and RNAs also play a key role in dynamic cell-type specific gene regulation. One of the central challenges in modern genomics is to learn these rules by which the genome and epigenome encode regulatory information. How does a single genome sequence encode the information for exquisitely precise, and yet highly distinctive programs of gene regulation for different cell types, and at different time points? What are the key sequence determinants, and grammatical rules that determine the function of any given DNA sequence under any particular set of conditions? In this project we seek to use public data from The Roadmap Epigenomics project and The ENCODE project to make progress on these questions. We propose to build methods for interpreting shared and distinctive regulatory features, including especially transcription factor binding, across related cell types. In parallel, we will implement novel methods for identifying high-resolution, context-specific dynamic regulatory elements, decipher their underlying regulatory sequence grammars and learn predictive, integrative models of transcriptional regulation to decipher the effects of heterogeneous regulatory components on lineage-specific gene expression dynamics and provide regulatory annotations for large collections of curated and disease-associated gene sets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop powerful statistical methods to study cell-type specific gene regulation, and apply these to publicly available data from The Roadmap Epigenomics Project, The ENCODE Project and several publicly available gene expression compendia. We propose new methods for joint inference of regulatory elements across diverse cell types, deciphering lineage-specific regulatory sequence grammars encoded in these elements and learning integrative transcriptional regulation programs.

"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.

"Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical genetic testing has become standard-of-care for many diseases including hundreds of inherited conditions. However, interpreting genetic test results is often confounded by the discovery of 'variants of unknown significance' (VUS) for which there is insufficient data or inadequate predictive tools to establish whether or not a particular variant predisposes to a disease. This problem is particularly vexing for genetic disorders with strong allelic heterogeneity and a preponderance of 'private' mutations such as the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), which predisposes young adults and children to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias. With the anticipated incorporation of personal exome or genome data into routine clinical care, interpreting VUS will become an even greater challenge especially when variants in genes associated with human disorders are incidentally discovered. Unfortunately, there are no reliable methods to predict a priori whether a given variant predisposes an individual to a particular disorder or whether the change is merely a benign rare variant. We propose to develop a novel paradigm for distinguishing disease-causing mutations from benign variants in LQTS as a model for other inherited arrhythmia syndromes and channelopathies. We will focus on variants in KCNQ1, the most commonly mutated gene in LQTS. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a holistic predictive model that relates experimentally determined protein structure and dynamics to function and disease is highly accurate even for novel variants. Our ultimate objectives are to develop a data-trained, web-accessible algorithm that classifies VUS discovered in KCNQ1 based on reliable predictions of the structure and dynamics of the affected protein, and to achieve prediction accuracy to levels needed to inform medical decisions. The medical importance of correctly classifying KCNQ1 variants provides strong justification for having a dedicated and highly-tailored gene-specific prediction model. The ability to distinguish deleterious from neutral variants would help avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in carriers of benign alleles, and save the lives of those with true mutations. We propose to collect extensive electrophysiological, biochemical and structural data on a large set of KCNQ1 variants discovered in LQTS subjects as well as several suspected benign or neutral variants (Aims 1-2), then use these data to iteratively train and validate a machine learning based algorithm that can differentiate benign from deleterious KCNQ1 alleles among a set of new VUS (Aim 3). Our proposal is innovative in the use of a multidisciplinary approach to functionally and structurally annotate genomic variant data for a medically important gene at an unprecedented scale, and then to use these experimental findings to train/test a novel computational system to achieve clinical-grade predictions. Targeting KCNQ1 will also validate an approach for parallel work that can be utilized to predict the medical significance of variants in closely related potassium channels associated with heritable epilepsy (KCNQ2, KCNQ3) or deafness (KCNQ4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a cause of sudden cardiac death in children and young adults. We propose a multidisciplinary experimental approach including electrophysiology, biochemistry and structural biology deployed on a large scale to generate information on at least 110 genetic variants in the main gene responsible for LQTS (KCNQ1), which encodes a potassium channel required for normal electrical activity in the heart. Our final product will be a data-trained computational strategy that will outperform existing methods for accurately predicting the functional consequences of novel KCNQ1 genetic variants, enhance the value of genetic testing in LQTS and provide for more informed medical decisions.",Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome,8892240,R01HL122010,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' arrhythmic agent ', ' antiarrhythmic agent ', ' Antiarrhythmic Drugs ', ' Antiarrhythmia Drugs ', ' Antiarrhythmia Agents ', ' Anti-Arrhythmics ', ' Anti-Arrhythmia Drugs ', ' Anti-Arrhythmia Agents ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biochemistry ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Deafness ', ' Sudden Death ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Genes ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Long QT Syndrome ', ' Methods ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Potassium Ion Channels ', ' K channel ', ' Potassium Channel ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Death, Sudden, Cardiac ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Stimulators, Electrical, Cardiac, Shock ', ' Electric Shock Cardiac Stimulators ', ' Defibrillators ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' cardiac rhythm ', ' heart rhythm ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' structural biology ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Protein Trafficking ', ' protein transport ', ' trafficking ', ' Structure ', ' genetic testing ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Cell surface ', ' proband ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' genome sequencing ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' First Degree Relative ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Molecular ', ' Cardiac ', ' protein function ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Implant ', ' web-accessible ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,1254784,0.15683172488267214
"HIV-1 Tat genetic variation impacts NeuroAIDS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 has demonstrated the ability to cause adverse neurological complications. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in improved survival, reduced viral loads, increased CD4 T- cell counts, reduced opportunistic infections, and has resulted in a decrease in the most severe form of HIV- associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), HIV-associated dementia (HAD). However, the overall prevalence of all forms of HAND has increased, potentially because HIV-1-infected individuals are living longer with persistent infection. In addition to activating an antiviral immne response within the CNS, the production of HIV-1 proteins leads to neurotoxicity through direct and indirect mechanisms. Of particular interest is the HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat, which in addition to driving viral transcription also functions as an extracellular neurotoxic protein, activator of astrocytes and microglial cells, and impacts the structure and function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Tat is released by infected monocytes, microglial cells, and astrocytes in addition to infected lymphocytes. Tat can be continually produced by HIV-1-infected cells located in the CNS despite the widespread use of HAART, demonstrating that neurologic vulnerability to this protein persists in the HAART era. In addition, mRNA levels for Tat are elevated in brain extracts from individuals with HAD. HIV-1 also displays extensive sequence variation with the quasispecies shaped by many host-specific and comorbidity pressures, while simultaneously maintaining functions that are critical to replication and infectivity as well as pathogenesis. Studies with respect to subtype B Tat genetic variation and HAND have demonstrated (i) Tat sequences from patients in the absence or presence of HAD showed clustering of sequences with respect to neurological impairment as well as tissue of origin, (ii) nonsynonymous versus synonymous mutation rates among brain-derived Tat sequences from patients with HAND were significantly greater than those isolated from patients without neurological disease, and (iii) variation at positions 74 and 100 were correlated to Tat sequences isolated from brain-derived sequences. Importantly, HIV-1 Tat derived from HAD patients has been associated with greater neuronal death. Together, these reports suggest that genetic diversity of HIV-1 Tat likely contributes to the establishment and severity of HAND. Given this, the hypothesis of this application is that patient-derived genetic variants of the HIV- protein Tat are specifically linked with neurologic impairment. To explore this hypothesis, the Specific Aims are to: (1) identify and characterize polymorphisms in HIV-1 Tat from patients with defined degrees of neurocognitive impairment; (2) examine the structural impact of HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms in protein-protein molecular models; and (3) examine the functional impact of the Tat polymorphisms on the BBB and cells of the CNS. These studies will contribute to defining how HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms affect the function of the CNS and the development of HAND and provide information useful in development of diagnostic assays of HAND and potential preventative and treatment strategies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed research is to identify and characterize genetic variation in the HIV-1 regulatory protein Tat with respect to alteration in it functional impact on cells of the CNS as well as the blood- brain barrier (BBB). This will be accomplished by examining amino acid changes within peripherally-derived and CNS-derived Tat proteins from neurologically impaired and unimpaired HIV-1-infected patients to define how HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms affect the development of HIV-associated neurologic disorders (HAND) and provide information useful in development of diagnostic assays of HAND and potential therapeutic strategies and vaccines.                ",HIV-1 Tat genetic variation impacts NeuroAIDS,8924295,R01NS089435,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ',

"GWAS TO GENE FUNCTION: NOS1AP AND OTHER QT INTERVAL GENES DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the electrographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait that impacts the risks of long QT syndrome and sudden cardiac death, have identified 68 independent variants at 35 loci, explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance. Nevertheless, the identity, function and mechanisms of action of the underlying DNA sequence variants and genes remain unknown, and are major impediments for understanding the molecular structure and functional architecture of this complex phenotype. We hypothesize that the majority of functional trait variants are polymorphic, non-coding and perturb transcription of a specific gene by altering the functions of their cis-regulatory elements. We propose a research paradigm for systematically identifying these non-coding trait variants, the regulatory functions they disrupt and the specific genes whose functions are altered at each quantitative trait locus. We will utilize integrative statisticl genetic, computational, molecular genetics and cellular approaches for elucidating the underlying mechanisms, using QT interval as a model 'system'. Our specific aims are: (1) to perform high- resolution mapping of GWAS signals to identify all polymorphic (>1%) and rare variants at loci that modulate the QT-interval; (2) to conduct in silico and in vitro analysis to predict and prioritize all cardiac regulatory (enhancer, silencer, insulator) elements and their cognate DNA-binding proteins; and, (3) to identify trait variants, genes and their mechanisms of genetic action. The overall goals are to improve the molecular genetic and mechanistic understanding of multifactorial traits for applications to other complex phenotypes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The electrocardiographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait for arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, has 68 predominantly non-coding variants at 35 loci explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance upon meta-analyses in >76,000 individuals of European and >11,000 individuals of African ancestry: nevertheless, the molecular details remain unknown. We propose a program of research for systematically identifying the functional non-coding quantitative trait variants, the regulatory function they disrupt and the specific gene whose functions are altered, at each locus. We utilize integrative statistical genetic, computational, molecular genetics and cellular approaches for understanding the underlying genetic mechanisms in this model trait with the overall goal to

"An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease result from platelet thrombus formation at the site of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. Numerous studies have shown enhanced platelet reactivity, and increased platelet count and volume are risk factors for CHD events and fatality, and a recent NHLBI Working Group concluded that variation in platelet reactivity is a major determinant of ischemic events, like MI or stroke. Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous common genetic variants associated with the risk of CHD and platelet function parameters, but most of the positive ""hits"" are not causative of the phenotype. To understand the cellular mechanisms by which these variants affect platelet function it is imperative to know the repertoire of mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs expressed in the cell of interest. Our team has been a leader in the field of platelet transcriptomics as well as functional assessment of variants in platelet genes. We have profiled mRNAs and miRNAs from 183 subjects using multiple platforms and have also performed platelet RNA-seq on 14 different subjects. This information provides a critical ability to filter, prioritize and obtain variant functional insights for evaluating GWAS SNPs associated with MI, stroke and platelet parameters. We have identified 142 mRNAs and 9 miRNAs that are expressed in platelets and linked to these GWAS hits. The goals of this proposal are to identify, assay, and validate functional variation previously tagged in GWASs of platelet-mediated ischemic arterial disease and of platelet phenotypes. Aim 1 will identify GWAS-linked mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs that are functional in platelets. Candidate RNAs will be refined by association with platelet function, eQTLs and QTLs using our previously generated platelet RNA data. We will develop a supervised machine-learning, statistical pattern matching algorithm to prioritize likely platelet-functional genes. Gene-level assays in which we knock down mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA in our human megakaryocyte culture system, followed by assays for integrin activation and quantification of platelet number and volume will be used to confirm platelet functionality. Aim 2 will identify functionally divergent SNPs and haplotypes. We will impute missing SNPs and perform fine-mapping to the phenotypes of interest. Variants will be prioritized by association strength, annotation data, and predicted function using publically available resources and our own platelet eQTL data. Non-coding candidates will be tested by reporter gene assay and non-synonymous variants will be tested using functional assays in cell lines in which the endogenous gene has been silenced. We will validate our findings with a replication analysis in which we use an independent cohort dataset to quantify the association of the tested variants with the original GWAS phenotype.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Platelet-mediated arterial thrombosis in the coronary or cerebrovascular circulation is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in the U.S. Numerous DNA variations have been associated with these disorders, but the causal genes are unknown. This research will test whether genes near these DNA variations - and candidate variations themselves - alter platelet function or number to understand better the molecular mechanisms causing heart attacks and strokes.            ",An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke,8985084,R01HL128234,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' platelet disorder ', ' platelet disease ', ' Thrombocytopathy ', ' Blood Platelet Disorders ', ' thrombocyte/platelet ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Platelets Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', "" Hayem's elementary corpuscle "", "" Deetjeen's body "", "" Bizzozero's corpuscle/cell "", ' Blood Platelets ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cells ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral vasculature ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Coronary Circulation ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' vulnerable plaque ', ' atherosclerotic plaque ', ' atherosclerotic lesions ', ' atherosclerosis plaque ', ' Atheromatous plaque ', ' Atheromatous degeneration ', ' Atheromatous ', ' Atheroma ', ' Arterial Fatty Streaks ', ' Arterial Fatty Streak ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Integrins Extracellular Matrix ', ' Integrins ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Introns ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' Megalokaryocyte ', ' Blood megakaryocyte ', ' Megakaryocytes ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2. The Working Groups formed in Aim 1 will establish criteria and oversee curators vetting variants. We will develop and optimize disease- and gene-specific machine learning algorithms to facilitate rapid classification of variants based on data provided by genetic testing services via ClinVar. We will integrate population-genetic data inferred from at least 25 reference populations from the 1000 Genomes Project and other large endeavors into our machine learning approaches so as to infer the global relevance of CRVs discovered here.

"Super-enhancer structure defines a signature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to decipher the genetic basis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with the chromatin modification information in human immune system. Accumulating evidence suggests that IBD results from an inappropriate inflammatory response to intestinal microbes in a genetically susceptible host. Among complex diseases, GWAS methods have been successful in IBD, identifying hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci. However, the majority of these disease-associated DNA variants fall into the gene-desert part of the genome, complicating their functional evaluation. There is now overwhelming evidence that the noncoding disease-associated DNA variants disrupt the action of key regulatory elements in relevant cell types. Since genomic coordinates of active regulatory elements can be charted using unique chromatin features, genome-wide profiling of chromatin modifications in relevant cell types can be used to pinpoint to DNA variants disrupting active regulatory elements.  Two recent studies discovered a novel kind of enhancers that occurs within exceptionally large genomic domains. These regions were initially dubbed as 'super-enhancers'. Super-enhancer domains occur at key identity genes in a variety of cell types. Strikingly, these enhancer domains are more sensitive to perturbation such as loss of transcription factors than typical shorter enhancers.  Because of the fragility of super-enhancers to perturbation, I postulate that super-enhancer domains of relevant immune cells harbor IBD-associated DNA variants. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 of this proposal, I will characterize super-enhancer structures of the human immune system. I will first develop an unsupervised machine learning technique to chart super-enhancer structures from histone acetylation (H3K27Ac) data in diverse immune cells. Using this technique, I will next delineate cell type- specific enhancer domains in the immune cells and investigate the relationship among cells types with respect to their super-enhancer structures. In Aim 2 of this proposal, I will investigate the enrichment of IBD-associated DNA variants within the super-enhancers of the most relevant immune cells. I then link these variants to genes and pathways that they regulate and are affected in disease utilizing gene expression and long-range chromatin interaction datasets. Completion of these aims, along with training opportunities associated with this proposal will establish the necessary foundation for my career as an independent investigator.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two common forms of (IBD), affect over 2.5 million people in North America and Europe. GWAS methods have identified hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci in IBD. Yet, the functional effects of mos IBD-implicated variants remain largely unexplained. The finding that nearly 90% of these sites occur outside of protein-coding sequences suggests that many associated variants may instead have a role in gene regulation. Cell context is a key determinant of gene regulation but where IBD genetic variants are functional is largely unknown. This proposal seeks to utilize the chromatin structure of human immune cells to discover the cell context for IBD-associated variants. The identification of the pathogenic cell types as well as the molecular pathways that contribute to the disease will contribute greatly to our ability to treat patients.              ",Super-enhancer structure defines a signature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),8749475,K22AI112570,"['Affect ', ' Inflammatory Arthritis ', ' Atrophic Arthritis ', ' Rheumatoid Arthritis ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-Cells ', ' B blood cells ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Cataloging ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Ulcerated Colitis ', ' Ulcerative Colitis ', ' regional enteritis ', ' eleocolitis ', ' Granulomatous Enteritis ', "" Crohn's disorder "", ' Crohn disease ', "" Crohn's disease "", ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' genetic enhancer element ', ' Enhancer Elements ', ' Enhancer Elements (Genetics) ', ' Europe ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' Non-Specific Immunity ', ' Native Immunity ', ' Innate Immunity ', ' Natural Immunity ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Intestines ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' monocyte ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' North America ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Enhancers ', ' T3 molecule ', ' T3 Complex ', ' T3 Antigens ', ' OKT3 antigen ', ' CD3 molecule ', ' CD3 Complex ', ' CD3 ', ' CD3 Antigens ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Epithelial ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Catalogs ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' cohort ', ' gene desert ', ' Junk DNA ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Histone Acetylation ', ' NCAM1 ', ' NCAM ', ' CD56 ', ' NCAM1 gene ', ' LYT3 ', ' CD8B1 ', ' CD8B ', ' CD8 ', ' CD8B1 gene ', ' CD14 ', ' CD14 gene ', ' CD19 ', ' CD19 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Molecular ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' NHGRI ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' commensal bacteria ', ' commensal microbes ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' markov model ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' Microbe ', ' human disease ', ' public health relevance ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' adaptive immunity ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K22,2015,161200,0.12119257381397887
"Inferring the effects of genetic variants on gene expression and splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to facilitate the interpretation of genetic variants identified in clinical whole- genome and whole-exome sequencing studies through the development of computational methods to predict functional effects of individual variants. Genome-scale sequencing technologies are increasingly enabling studies of genetic variation in large numbers of individuals; however, interpreting the clinical significance of the hundreds of thousands of genetic variants identified in these studies remains a critical challenge. Gene expression regulation is one mechanism by which variants can result in disease or other clinically-significant phenotypes. This mechanism is likely to be particularly important for disease-causing variants that do not directly affect protein structure by altering an amino acid sequence. The methods developed here will enable researchers to predict whether genetic variants are likely to have a regulatory effect on gene expression. The first stage of the project is to build computational models to predict such regulatory effects using a random forest machine learning approach. These models will be trained to recognize regulatory variation using a set of variants that have been shown to be involved in expression regulation in a recent study of gene expression across hundreds of individuals. Separate algorithms will be developed to predict two different types of regulatory effects: changes in the total amount of RNA produced from a particular gene (expression level variation) and changes in the specific form of RNA produced from a particular gene (splicing or isoform ratio variation). The second stage of the project is to evaluate the performance of these models on gene expression datasets from a separate human population and from different tissues within the human body, to explore their generalizability and to determine to what extent the characteristics of regulatory variants are conserved across tissues and populations. The final stage of the project is to use genetic variants in publicly-available databases that are known to be pathogenic to characterize how well these models perform at predicting clinical significance. This stage will test the hypothesis that variants that regulate gene expression are more likely to be clinically significant than variants that do not regulate expression. This project will impact public health by providing useful tools to improve prediction of the clinical significance of genetic variants identified in genome- scale sequencing studies.

"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.

"Statistical and computational analysis in whole genome sequencing studies. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will investigate several issues arising from the statistical and computational analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) based genomics studies. In the area of data management in WGS studies, we address the rapidly increasing cost associated with the transfer and storage of the massive files for the sequence reads and their associated quality scores. We will develop data compression methods to achieve a further compression of several folds beyond current standards, with minimal incurred errors. In the area of secondary analysis, we will develop new statistical learning methods to improve variant quality score recalibration and to filter out unreliable calls. This will improve te reliability of the key information provided by the WGS data, which are the variants calls indicating the locations where the genome differs from the reference and the nature of the differences. We will study methods for case-control studies based on WGS. In particular, we will develop statistical models to enable the integrating of information from multiple types of variants to obtain more powerful tests of association. We will apply the methods developed in this aim to the analysis of WGS data from a study on abdominal aortic aneurysm. Finally, we will address selected new questions associated with population scale WGS projects. Several national programs have recently been initiated to generate WGS data for hundreds of thousands of individuals with longitudinal medical records. The availability of this comprehensive data on a population scale will open up a rich frontier for genome medicine and will pose many new challenges for statistical analysis. We will formulate some of these new challenges and develop the statistical methods needed to meet these challenges. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research in this project concerns the design and implementation of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of data from whole genome sequencing studies.

"Integrative interpretation of the organismal consequences of non-coding variation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our capacity to sequence human genomes has exceeded our ability to interpret genetic variation, particularly in non-coding regions. To address this challenge, we recently developed a novel framework, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD), for estimating the deleteriousness of any genetic variant. CADD defines an objective, data-rich, and quantitative integration of many genomic annotations into a single measure of variant effect at the organismal level. The goals of this R01 proposal are to further develop the CADD framework, to apply it in the context of ongoing genetic studies of both rare and common human diseases, and to experimentally evaluate its predictions. In Specific Aim 1, we will substantially modify CADD in both straightforward and creative ways, with the goal of dramatically improving CADD's ability to annotate non- coding variants, not only to estimate their organismal effects but also to provide insights into molecular mechanisms. In Specific Aim 2, we will apply CADD to a variety of ongoing whole genome sequencing studies of human disease, especially those in which non-coding variants are either known or suspected to be causal. As part of this effort, we will develop new statistical frameworks that directly incorporat CADD into traditional genome-wide discovery approaches. In Specific Aim 3, we will perform a combination of high-throughput (massively parallel reporter assays), medium-throughput (CRISPR/Cas9), and low-throughput (in vivo mouse transgenics) experimental assays for systematic and targeted assessment of CADD predictions. This proposal includes both computational and experimental innovations, and builds on established collaborative relationships between investigators with complementary strengths. The completion of our aims will yield novel methods, data, and resources with which to annotate whole genome sequences, broadly enabling the field to more effectively identify and mechanistically understand non-coding genetic variants that are causally relevant to human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As we enter an era of personalized medicine, a deep understanding of human genomes will be increasingly important to public health, contributing to the unraveling of the genetic basis of human disease, as well as serving an increasing role in clinical diagnostics. However, our limited understanding of the functional consequences of most genetic variants, especially those that do not alter protein sequence, represents a major obstacle. This proposal seeks to dramatically improve our ability to identify and interpret ""non-coding"" variants that causally contribute to human disease. A recently developed computational approach will be substantially improved and evaluated in a variety of genetic studies, and its predictions will be experimentally validated. This project will provide much needed methods and resources to address the looming analytical challenges associated with individual whole genome sequencing in both biomedical research and patient care.                ",Integrative interpretation of the organismal consequences of non-coding variation,8792292,R01CA197139,"['Algorithms ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' pedigree structure ', ' Pedigree ', ' genetic pedigree ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Translating ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' trait ', ' UTRs ', ' Untranslated Regions ', ' Structure ', ' Human Biology ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Protein Sequencing Molecular Biology ', ' Protein Sequencing ', ' Protein Sequence Determinations ', ' Amino Acid Sequence Determinations ', ' Peptide Sequence Determination ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' RNA Binding ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vivo ', ' Molecular ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' disease phenotype ', ' Complex Genetic Trait ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' insertion/deletion ', ' insertion-deletion mutation ', ' insertion-deletion ', ' insertion/deletion mutation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' human disease ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' public health relevance ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' candidate identification ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' exome sequencing ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized medicine ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,666593,0.1444537482503179
"Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although investments in genomic studies of mental disorders enabled the discovery of thousands of robustly associated variants with these complex diseases, the translation of these discoveries into actionable targets has been hampered by the lack of a mechanistic understanding on how genome variation relates to phenotype. Moreover, it has been widely shown that a substantial portion of the genetic control of complex traits, including mental disorders, is exerted through the regulation of gene expression. However, effective methods to fully harness this mechanism are lagging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel gene-based test -PrediXcan- that directly tests this regulatory mechanism and substantially improves power relative to single variant tests and other gene-based tests. PrediXcan is inherently mechanistic and provides directionality, highlighting its potential utility in identifying novel targets for therapy. The method consists of predicting the whole genome effect on expression traits and correlating this effect with disease risk to identify novel disease genes. In addition, we propose novel approaches to investigate the context-specificity of expression traits (Orthogonal Tissue Decomposition) and to quantify the collective effect of the regulated transcriptome on phenotypes of interest (Regulability). Regulability is similar to the concept of chip heritability (total variability explained collectivey by genotyped variants). First, we will develop cross-tissue, tissue-specific (for over 30 different human tissue types), and brain-region specific expression traits. We will use statistical machine learning methods to develop whole genome prediction models for these traits and extend this work to other molecular phenotypes. All models will be stored in open access databases. Next, we will apply the PrediXcan method to 7 mental disorder phenotypes. More specifically, we will compute genetically predicted levels of gene expression traits and correlate them with disease risk to identify genes involved in disease pathways. We will also quantify the collective effect of the predicted transcriptome (regulability) on mental disorder risk across multiple tissues. Finally we will extend PrediXcan method and develop a method to infer the results of PrediXcan using summary statistics data as opposed to individual level data. This will extend the applicability of the approach to all summary results generated by meta-analysis consortia and increase the power to discover novel genes given the larger sample sizes. The research we propose is driven by an extensive set of preliminary studies, and promises substantial deliverables in both new methods of analysis and public access results databases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large investments in genome studies have been made to understand the consequences of genetic variation on human traits. These have yielded many genetic variants reproducibly associated with disease but the underlying biology is still unclear. We propose a novel computational method that links mechanistically the genetic variability to disease risk and apply it to a range of mental disorder studies to provide more biological insights and enable discovery of potential targets for drug development.            ","Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect",8945859,R01MH107666,"['senile dementia of the

"ANALYSIS OF COMBINATORIAL CIS-REGULATION IN SYNTHETIC AND GENOMIC PROMOTER ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.            ",ANALYSIS OF COMBINATORIAL CIS-REGULATION IN SYNTHETIC AND GENOMIC PROMOTER,8888066,R01GM092910,"['Affect ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Elements ', ' Explosion ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' RNA Polymerases ', ' EC 2.7.7.6 ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases ', ' DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase ', ' Specificity ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stem cells ', ' Testing ', ' Thermodynamic ', ' Thermodynamics ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Measures ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Funding ', ' Reporter ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' empowered ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' cell engineering ', ' cellular engineering ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Chromosome Positioning ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Collection ', ' To specify ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' combinatorial ', ' public health relevance ', ' gDNA ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' ']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,397299,0.03373204738570703
"F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-to-patient variability in response to drugs creates a significant challenge for the safe and effective treatment of many human diseases. Pharmacogenomics seeks to address this challenge by linking drug response to patient genotypes at important loci, termed pharmacogenes, in order to better customize patient treatments. Genetic variation in pharmacogenes is extensive. For example, amongst 12 CYP genes, 10% of people carry at least one rare, potentially deleterious variant. Unfortunately, only a small number of variants have been unambiguously linked to alterations in drug response. Clearly, new approaches are needed to annotate the consequences of the huge pool of variants of unknown significance, including those already identified by existing large-scale sequencing programs, and those that will be discovered as clinical sequencing becomes routine. In this proposal, we seek to address this problem directly and at a scale never before possible by taking advantage of new technologies in sequencing and functional analysis. Our resource, termed F-CAP (Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes) will test all possible substitutions at all amino acid residues in some of the most clinically important pharmacogenes and disseminate these data to the medical and research communities. In order to accomplish this, we will use deep mutational scanning, a method we have developed that allows parallelized, and quantitative measurements to be performed on libraries of genetic variants. In Aim 1 we will create these libraries, starting with five of the most important CPIC level A or B priority genes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, TPMT and VKORC1), and test the stability and enzymatic activity of each variant en masse using a pooled selection strategy. In Aim 2, we will integrate these data to create an impact score. This impact score provides a numerical value for a variant's functional effects that is amenable to easy integration into prescribing guidelines being developed by the pharmacogenomics community. Aim 3 will validate this score for a subset of variants that span the impact score spectrum using therapeutically relevant substrates for each pharmacogene. Finally, Aim 4 describes a key component of this resource: the dissemination of our findings to the entire pharmacogenomics community through partnership with CPIC and PharmGKB. In addition, we will make available our raw and processed data via a custom web resource that will also be developed in Aim 4. This resource will provide a series of fully annotated datasets describing the functional consequences of every possible single mutation in a series of key pharmacogenes, thereby greatly advancing the field of personalized medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pharmacogenomics seeks to identify genetic sources of inter-individual variability in drug response, with the goal of personalizing drug selection and dose to improve patient outcomes. A key barrier to using pharmacogenomic information is lack of clarity about the functional impact of variants, which hampers the provision of clear, unambiguous guidance to health care providers.

"Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The whole genome sequencing of large cohorts of individuals is quickly becoming a common tool for researchers to investigate the genetic basis of many disease phenotypes. The primary goals are to discover the underlying genetic variation that cause or contribute to these diseases as well as to correctly identify these variants in a diagnostic setting. These differences typicall consist of single base changes (SNPs), but can also encompass larger, more complex chromosomal rearrangements in the form of structural variation (SV) which are much more difficult to detect even with modern sequencing technologies. A number of approaches have been published that have studied this problem, but even the largest scale endeavors have only focused on deletion events and reported a sensitivity of <70%. Complex chromosomal rearrangements are even less well studied. Thus, it is paramount that accurate methods are developed which can detect all types of SVs at high specificity from sequence data. This proposal aims to improve the overall ability of researchers to identify and analyze genetic variation from whole genome sequences. An important, and often overlooked, aspect of SV discovery is the fact that typical paired-end, read depth, and split read approaches will identify different sets of non-overlapping variants at varying degrees of accuracy. In Aim 1, we will develop a unified SV discovery algorithm that can incorporate all of these different sources of information in a probabilistic fashion. Such a method would be useful for research, in particular with the identification of rare variants, as well as clinical applications which require a great del of accuracy and have thus far been limited to older karyotyping and microarray approaches. This would identify the majority of structural variants, however there are many regions in genomic sequences which are complex in nature, defined as consisting of multiple neighboring or overlapping chromosomal rearrangements that are challenging to resolve with typical SV detection approaches. In Aim 2, we propose methods to resolve these complex regions and assess their frequency and impact. Furthermore, a crucial step in medical genetics is the comparison of identified genetic mutations to databases of known pathogenic and benign variants. This is currently problematic with SVs, as they have often been originally reported with varying degrees of breakpoint resolution that can hamper the correct assignment of the variant. This issue is compounded further in more complex regions with multiple breakpoints, for which simplistic comparison methods do not work well. In Aim 3, we will develop and implement a system that describes and utilizes variant profiles to identify whether an individual's sequence data contains a variant of interest. Overall, this project will advance our understanding of the human genome as well as provide tools for use in the general research and clinical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The rearrangement of chromosomal material in the form of structural variation is directly responsible for many disease phenotypes, however our ability to detect and resolve these events from whole genome sequence data is currently limited. We propose a number of strategies for improving the detection and analysis of structural genomic variation between individuals and resolving their underlying structure and function.

"High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will develop the first validated predictive model of how transcription factors dynamically determine genome-wide chromatin accessibility that is generalizable across biological systems. We will accomplish this goal with three specific aims. We will develop novel Genome Syntax to Regulation (GSR) models that accurately learn a genomic regulatory vocabulary and predict how phrases in this vocabulary control chromatin accessibility (Aim 1). As part of this aim we will identify transcription factor binding motifs tha are in the discovered regulatory vocabulary. We will validate and refine the causality of these models by testing whether they accurately predict the chromatin accessibility of thousands of synthetic DNA ""phrases"" that have been engineered into specific genomic locations and measured in the context of transcription factor gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. The phrases will be designed to elucidate both the factors and grammar that control chromatin opening in several distinct cellular states (Aim 2). We will use our predictive models to assign importance scores to individual genome bases and to predict how selected factors alter chromatin accessibility genome wide (Aim 3). We will test the ability of our importance scores to identify regulatory SNPs in the context of human genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, and we will validate model predictions of changes in whole genome chromatin accessibility in response to ectopic factor expression. Through computational modeling of the effect of such ectopic factor expression, we will develop a predictive understanding of how transcription factors alter chromatin state, laying the groundwork for a novel regenerative medicine paradigm of predictive cellular programming.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Access to the information in our genomes is regulated by a cell much like doors in a building can regulate access to rooms that contain instructions.

"Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genetic code not only determines protein amino acid residue sequence but also defines the 'splicing code' of cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements that control pre-mRNA splicing. Single nucleotide variant (SNV) changes at key regions in pre-mRNA may disrupt splicing resulting in disease [1, 2]. Understanding which SNVs cause aberrant splicing and which are benign is important for understanding disease pathogenesis. SNVs at consensus splice sites, at exon-intron junctions, are known to cause aberrant splicing and contribute to at least 10% of inherited diseases [2]. However, SNVs outside consensus splice sites can still disrupt splicing [3]. Current, bioinformatics tools limit analysis to SNVs at or near consensus splice sites and lack the ability to generalize to SNVs beyond the consensus splice site [4-7]. In this application, I propose to substantially improve the ability to interpret the consequences of mutations on pre-mRNA splicing. This goal will be achieved by: 1) developing novel features, useful in predicting the impact of variation on cis- splicing regulation; 2) training a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses the novel features to predict the impact of SNVs; 3) sharing the algorithm in a publically available software package; and 4) comparing algorithm predictions to the relationships between SNVs and splicing patterns derived from matched DNA- and RNA-sequencing studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic sequences not only encode the amino acids of proteins but also regulate many critical biological functions, including pre-mRNA splicing.

"Predicting causal non-coding variants in a founder population Enter the text here that is the new abstract information for your application. This section must be no longer than 30 lines of text. In order to characterize the molecular and cellular causes of human disease, it will be essential to unravel the functional impact of genetic variation. However, we are currently unable to predict the impact of the majority of genetic variants that lie in non-coding regions of the genome, where indeed most complex disease-associated variants are found. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that a significant fraction of the non-coding genome is likely to be functional, often playing a role in gene regulation. Therefore, our limited understanding of non- coding variation is a critical hurdle to characterizing the genetic basis of disease. The goal of this project is to develop methods for interpreting non-coding genetic variation: to provide a robust and extensible Bayesian method for predicting causal variants from full genomes, to identify and validate a large set of functional non- coding variants using CRISPR technology, and to predict disease-relevant traits likely to be affected by each variant. Our project will leverage the increasing availability of cohorts such as UK10K, GTEx, CARTaGENE and SardiNIA, with genome sequence and transcriptome data available from thousands of individuals, along with extensive phenotyping for hundreds of traits. We will combine advanced statistical modeling with experimental validation based on genome engineering to identify causal non-coding variants affecting biomedical traits in the cohort, along with predicting functional mechanisms through which these variants ultimately perturb the cell. In Aim 1, we develop computational methods for predicting causal non-coding variation from full genomes, incorporating multiple informative genomic features into a Bayesian approach. We will optimize and apply these methods on genome and transcriptome data available for well-studied and broadly-accessible cohorts to identify a large set of variants predicted to causally affect gene expression. Based on these predictions, in Aim 2, we connect putative causal variants with the diverse set of disease- relevant traits measured in the cohort, using network inference to capture the cascade from genetic variation to gene expression to disease. We will develop methods to integrate across variants, using the models in Aim 1, to identify the common causal mechanisms related to each trait. In Aim 3, we validate the causal impact of non-coding variants predicted to affect high-level traits. We will use genome editing through CRISPR to introduce individual genetic variants into cell lines and use qPCR to validate the predicted effects on gene expression. Finally, a major goal throughout this proposal will be to provide the research community with convenient computational tools for the prediction of causal non-coding variants from individual genomes, updated on an ongoing basis to integrate the most recent genomic annotations and public data in order to provide the best possible accuracy in predicting causal variants and the traits they are likely to affect. Our project will greatly advance our understanding of non-coding genetic variation, the specific mechanisms affected by causal variants, and the downstream consequences to the cell and individual health. 2. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Understanding the impact of variation in the entire genome, beyond the well-studied protein-coding regions, is essential to understanding the relationship between genetics and human health.

"""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation to predict Innate Immune Responses     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The expression of genes involves a sequence of enzymatic events, such as transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA decay, and translation, that are subject to gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of protein-nucleic acid interactions. It is well appreciated that the control of transcription via regulatory networks that regulate enhancer and promoter activities are not the sole determinant of what gene products result, but that exon skipping is pervasive and post-transcriptional mechanisms such as mRNA splicing and decay determine the kinetics of mRNA induction and abundance. Indeed, in our preliminary studies of the macrophage response to pathogens, we find that a majority of induced gene expression events result in mRNAs that deviate substantially from those predicted by the genome-browser, and that mRNA decay is controlled by both protein- nucleic acid and miRNA regulatory networks. The proposed Center for the ""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop a predictive model for which mRNA isoforms are expressed and at what level given a given promoter activity and transcription initiation rate. We will develop generally applicable tools in conjunction with or in depth and quantitative experimental analysis of the macrophage response to pathogen-associated endotoxin, which results in the dramatic up regulation of more than 1000 genes. Strikingly, our preliminary data identified more than 900 exon skipping events in addition to numerous cases of alternative 5' or 3' splice site use, emphasizing the essential contribution of post-initiation events. Further, these splice patterns are dependent on the macrophage subtype-specific chromatin landscape and are altered by inducible splice factors in primed or tolerated states. Thus we will leverage the well-described macrophage biology and associated experimental model systems, to examine the role of gene structure and sequence (Aim 1), the role of chromatin modifications (Aim 2), and of trans-acting splicing factors (Aim 3) in determining the identity of mature mRNAs and their associated synthesis rates, before adding the stimulus-responsive regulatory networks that confer mRNA half-life control and thus determine the abundance of each mRNA isoform (Aim 4).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed Center for the Ribonomics of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop gene regulatory network (GRN) models that predict which of many alternative mRNA isoforms are actually expressed and at what level.

"Linking disease-associated variants to transcriptional regulation using ENCODE DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 3000 loci associated with common disease, the mechanism by which variation at these loci are pathogenic remains unclear. The ENCODE project provides a unique resource of extensive functional genomic data that can be used to close this knowledge gap. The overall objective of this application is to develop computational methods to integrate data from the ENCODE project with GWAS data to predict simultaneously the relevant tissue type and functionally important variants for a given disease. A secondary objective is to validate these approaches through the analysis of data on cancer and autoimmune disease. The central hypothesis is that loci identified through GWAS tag functional SNPs that cause disease by altering transcription factor binding sites, thereby dysregulating genes in the relevant tissue typ (e.g. pre-neoplastic tissue for cancer and immune cells for autoimmune disease). The rationale that underlies this research is that the ENCODE data represents a rich resource for understanding GWAS results and that the methods to be developed here will enable similar analysis on other diseases. The research team is well prepared to undertake the proposed research because of their combined expertise in the conduct and analysis of GWAS, functional and bioinformatics follow-up of GWAS hits, and machine learning approaches to understanding genome-scale data including transcription factor binding. The central hypothesis will be tested through these aims: 1) Determine if ENCODE data generated in the appropriate tissue type can be used to find putative functional transcriptional regulatory variants at disease-associated loci. This will be achieved by asking if lymphoma risk SNPs tend to alter transcription factor binding sites and associate with expression of nearby genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines. 2) Using ENCODE data, identify the cell types and tissue(s) important for a given disease. Relevant cell types will be identified by determining those cell types in which genes are more likely to be expressed near disease risk loci in the ENCODE data. 3) Identify putative functional SNPs in GWAS using ENCODE when complete functional genomic data is not available for the appropriate tissue type. To extend these analyses beyond the few cell types extensively studied in ENCODE, DNase hypersensitivity data from the relevant tissue will be linked with ChIP-Seq transcription factor binding data from other tissues to allow identification of variants that alter transcription factor binding. This research is significant because it will provide new insight into the biology of cancer and autoimmune disease. More importantly, it will provide the tools necessary to use the ENCODE data to link disease risk loci with functional variants and potential mechanistic explanations.

"EMERGE PHASE III CLINICAL CENTER AT PARTNERS HEALTHCARE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eMERGE III Clinical Center proposal from Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank, clinical data in the electronic medical records (EMR) for >4 million participants from the largest integrated health care provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise and state-of-the-art genetic analysis. We propose three aims. (1) Aim 1. Discovery. We will test the hypothesis that common and rare variants from a custom chip including 50,000 loss of function (LoF) alleles will be associated with cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric and immune-mediated phenotypes derived from the EMR. We are currently genotyping 25,000 Partners HealthCare Biobank subjects with a custom chip that includes LoF alleles from 63,000 exomes that we have analyzed. (2) Aim 2. Penetrance and Pleiotropy. We will test the hypothesis that sequencing a set of established genes or loci will allow us to discover additional variation, and define penetrance and pleiotropy using EMR phenotypes. Rare variants in genes selected by the eMERGE network will be studied for penetrance and pleiotropic outcomes by PheWAS and chart review. In addition, we are poised to perform recall-by-genotype studies because all Biobank participants have provided consent for such callback. (3) Aim 3. Implementation. We will test the hypothesis that physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based upon voluntary return of actionable variants to provide safe and cost-effective benefits to patients. We will screen our entire Biobank population of 25,000 individuals for pathogenic variants in the LDLR gene, the leading genetic cause of premature coronary artery disease, and conduct an exploratory trial in disclosing this information. Biobank participants with pathogenic variants in LDLR will be offered enrollment into a randomized trial, in which their finding will be CLIA-confirmed, and in one arm, this result will be communicated to their physicians through the EMR. Over one year, we will collect the following outcomes through participant surveys and EMR queries: physician visits, laboratory testing, changes in medication prescriptions, LDL levels, medical costs and the number of family members screened and treated as a result of the intervention. We will collaborate with the entire eMERGE III Network to incorporate what we learn from this pilot trial into large-scale implementation protocols for the genes selected by the Network for sequencing. Finally, we will participate in all Network activities to enhance the movement of genetics into clinical practice.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The discovery and clinical use of genetic variants associated with both rare Mendelian and more common complex diseases promises to dramatically change the practice of medicine. Our eMERGE III project will leverage a large Biobank and a rich electronic medical record to define the phenotypic impact of mutations emerging from sequencing and then return results on selected

"Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects have generated a collection of 3000+ epigenomics datasets, including histone modification, DNA methylation, gene expression, and DNaseI hypersensitivity profiled across 190 cell and tissue types. In order to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health, novel computational analyses are needed. To address this challenge, we will develop new methods for epigenomic analysis, building on our extensive experience interpreting epigenomic information, and our preliminary studies building chromatin states, activity clusters, and regulatory motif maps for the Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE datasets. In Aim 1, we will characterize epigenomic differences and changes during lineage differentiation by developing new tools for systematic comparison of groups of epigenomes that directly exploit the complexity of epigenomic datasets; we will also develop methods for clustering epigenomes into developmental lineages based on automatically-learned diverse epigenomic features that distinguish them; and methods that learn the unidirectional epigenomic changes that pluripotent cells undergo during lineage commitment to gain more insights into differentiation and automatically learn to classify lineages and differentiation trajectories. In Am 2, we will seek to characterize higher-order chromatin architecture and chromatin conformation to enable systematic interpretation of cis-regulatory modules: we will develop a novel statistical approach for enhancer-enhancer and enhancer-gene linking to reveal interacting regions and their target genes based on their coordinated activity patterns across cell and tissue types; we will train a supervised learning method for predicting both constitutive and tissue-specific chromatin conformation information based on chromatin state information, individual chromatin marks, genomic distance, activity, regulatory motif information, and DNA sequence; and we will use these higher-order interaction maps to predict gene expression levels based on the combined action of multiple regulatory regions and to define the cis-regulatory architecture of each gene in the human genome. The resulting resources will be invaluable for studies of gene regulation, by revealing the set of regulatory elements that are linked to each gene, and for the interpretation of genetic studies, by revealing the set of regulatory elements which jointly act to regulate each target gene and the potential target genes of non-coding variants associated with human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have generated a collection of 4000+ epigenomics datasets across 200+ cell and tissue types, which can be invaluable to the scientific community, but novel computational analyses are needed to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health. To address this need, we propose to systematically study epigenomic differences between cell types, lineages, and stages of differentiation, and to learn models predicting the higher-order chromatin structures across cell/tissue types, within each cell/tissue, and the chromatin architectures that they define. By systematically interpreting epigenomic annotations in the context of their cellular differentiation and their higher-order chromatin structures, the resultin resource will greatly increase their impact on human health by enabling disease studies to understand the mechanistic relationship between non-coding variants and their target genes, and the specific differentiation stages in which they act.                ",Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets,8847548,R01GM113708,"['Algorithms ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Health ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions, Nucleic Acid (Genetics) ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Enhancers ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' experience ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' ward ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Higher Order Structure ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Folding ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Structure ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Collection ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' comparison group ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' human disease ', ' comparative ', ' public health relevance ', ' epigenome ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' ']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2015,283300,0.08421345851064095
"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the 'early' detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to is development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to fine- map already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this two- stage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 ""convenience controls"" from the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the 'early' subclinical phenotypes identified through the use o VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1. Lastly, for the second part of Aim 3, we will investigate the potential function of KC variants by testing their ability to influence gene structure, expression and function in corneal cell models, including iPS cells derived from corneal keratocytes developed by our research team. The results of these studies will help advance our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to KC and may result in novel treatment options to slow the progression of the disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving methods for the 'early' detection of keratoconus will help patients avoid complications of LASIK surgery, allow us to identify genetic variants that contribute to its development, and design therapies to retard its progression.            ",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,8817912,R01EY009052,"['Affect ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cells ', ' corneal ', ' Cornea ', ' corneal transplant ', ' corneal keratoplasty ', ' Corneal Transplantation ', ' Corneal Grafting ', ' Cornea Transplantation ', ' Keratoplasty ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discriminant Analyses ', ' Discriminant Analysis ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' eye disorder ', ' Eye diseases ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Grant ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' indexing ', ' Keratoconus ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Lasers ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' tomography ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Family member ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Surface ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' In Situ ', ' Techniques ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' reverse transcriptase PCR ', ' RTPCR ', ' RT-PCR ', ' Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Videokeratography ', ' Videokeratographies ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' protein expression ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' therapy design/development ', ' genetic association ', ' Data ', ' Gene Structure/Organization ', ' Gene Organization ', ' Gene Structure ', ' Molecular ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' protein function ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' manage cholesterol ', ' cholesterol management ', ' cholesterol control ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' genomewide linkage ', ' genome-wide linkage ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,661520,0.05619287049946457
"Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in disease genomes or across population. The next great challenge is to elucidate the potential function of various genetic variants in biological an disease processes. An important type of functional variants consists of those that affect gene expression in cis. Indeed, cis-regulatory variants are involved in a broad range of diseases and they showed a consistently stronger influence on gene expression than trans-acting determinants. Alternative splicing is an essential mechanism via which cis-regulatory changes may occur. Previous studies estimated that 15- 60% of point mutations that result in human genetic diseases disrupt splicing, highlighting the importance of this regulatory step. In addition to the well-known splice site signals, splicing is closely regulated by many exonic or intronic cis elements, associated with trans-acting proteins. Disruption of these cis-regulatory elements can cause aberrant splicing. Yet this crucial regulatory aspect remains largely unexplored. We propose to combine computational, genomic and molecular approaches to study splicing changes due to genetic variations. The specific aims are: (1) To globally identify exons and genes that are under differential splicing regulation by the alternative alleles of genetic variant, via bioinformatic analysis of high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome profiles (RNA-Seq). (2) To identify causal genetic variants in splicing alteration using minigene-based experiments. (3) To develop an integrative model to predict causal genetic variants in splicing alteration, using machine learning approaches, RNA- Seq data and molecular validations. This project will elucidate functional cis-regulatory genetic variants in splicing and provide significant insight ino the involvement of genetic variations in human diseases. In addition, this work will generate valuable bioinformatic tools to make full use of the increasingly available RNA-Seq data in a wide variety of cell types for identification and prediction of disease-related genetic variants. Aberrant splicing can significantly alter gene expression and contribute to human diseases. The proposed research aims to gain a systematic understanding of the functional roles of genetic variations (e.g., mutations or polymorphisms) in the regulation of splicing. This work will provide mechanistic basis for how genetic variations may contribute to diseases, such that future interventions can target specific splicing events therapeutically.",Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation,8822892,R01HG006264,"['Affect ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Cataloging ', ' Cells ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Exons ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Housing ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Introns ', ' Methods ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' trans acting factor (genetic) ', ' Transactivators ', ' Trans-Acting Factors ', ' Trans-Activators ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Point Mutation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Catalogs ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' RNA analysis ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Tissue-Specific Splicing ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' human disease ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA-seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2015,300300,0.1954682787138009
"HIV-1 Tat genetic variation impacts NeuroAIDS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 has demonstrated the ability to cause adverse neurological complications. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in improved survival, reduced viral loads, increased CD4 T- cell counts, reduced opportunistic infections, and has resulted in a decrease in the most severe form of HIV- associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), HIV-associated dementia (HAD). However, the overall prevalence of all forms of HAND has increased, potentially because HIV-1-infected individuals are living longer with persistent infection. In addition to activating an antiviral immne response within the CNS, the production of HIV-1 proteins leads to neurotoxicity through direct and indirect mechanisms. Of particular interest is the HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat, which in addition to driving viral transcription also functions as an extracellular neurotoxic protein, activator of astrocytes and microglial cells, and impacts the structure and function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Tat is released by infected monocytes, microglial cells, and astrocytes in addition to infected lymphocytes. Tat can be continually produced by HIV-1-infected cells located in the CNS despite the widespread use of HAART, demonstrating that neurologic vulnerability to this protein persists in the HAART era. In addition, mRNA levels for Tat are elevated in brain extracts from individuals with HAD. HIV-1 also displays extensive sequence variation with the quasispecies shaped by many host-specific and comorbidity pressures, while simultaneously maintaining functions that are critical to replication and infectivity as well as pathogenesis. Studies with respect to subtype B Tat genetic variation and HAND have demonstrated (i) Tat sequences from patients in the absence or presence of HAD showed clustering of sequences with respect to neurological impairment as well as tissue of origin, (ii) nonsynonymous versus synonymous mutation rates among brain-derived Tat sequences from patients with HAND were significantly greater than those isolated from patients without neurological disease, and (iii) variation at positions 74 and 100 were correlated to Tat sequences isolated from brain-derived sequences. Importantly, HIV-1 Tat derived from HAD patients has been associated with greater neuronal death. Together, these reports suggest that genetic diversity of HIV-1 Tat likely contributes to the establishment and severity of HAND. Given this, the hypothesis of this application is that patient-derived genetic variants of the HIV- protein Tat are specifically linked with neurologic impairment. To explore this hypothesis, the Specific Aims are to: (1) identify and characterize polymorphisms in HIV-1 Tat from patients with defined degrees of neurocognitive impairment; (2) examine the structural impact of HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms in protein-protein molecular models; and (3) examine the functional impact of the Tat polymorphisms on the BBB and cells of the CNS. These studies will contribute to defining how HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms affect the function of the CNS and the development of HAND and provide information useful in development of diagnostic assays of HAND and potential preventative and treatment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed research is to identify and characterize genetic variation in the HIV-1 regulatory protein Tat with respect to alteration in it functional impact on cells of the CNS as well as the blood- brain barrier (BBB). This will be accomplished by examining amino acid changes within peripherally-derived and CNS-derived Tat proteins from neurologically impaired and unimpaired HIV-1-infected patients to define how HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms affect the development of HIV-associated neurologic disorders (HAND) and provide information useful in development of diagnostic assays of HAND and potential therapeutic strategies and vaccines.",HIV-1 Tat genetic variation impacts NeuroAIDS,8996738,R01NS089435,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune

"Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects have generated a collection of 3000+ epigenomics datasets, including histone modification, DNA methylation, gene expression, and DNaseI hypersensitivity profiled across 190 cell and tissue types. In order to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health, novel computational analyses are needed. To address this challenge, we will develop new methods for epigenomic analysis, building on our extensive experience interpreting epigenomic information, and our preliminary studies building chromatin states, activity clusters, and regulatory motif maps for the Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE datasets. In Aim 1, we will characterize epigenomic differences and changes during lineage differentiation by developing new tools for systematic comparison of groups of epigenomes that directly exploit the complexity of epigenomic datasets; we will also develop methods for clustering epigenomes into developmental lineages based on automatically-learned diverse epigenomic features that distinguish them; and methods that learn the unidirectional epigenomic changes that pluripotent cells undergo during lineage commitment to gain more insights into differentiation and automatically learn to classify lineages and differentiation trajectories. In Am 2, we will seek to characterize higher-order chromatin architecture and chromatin conformation to enable systematic interpretation of cis-regulatory modules: we will develop a novel statistical approach for enhancer-enhancer and enhancer-gene linking to reveal interacting regions and their target genes based on their coordinated activity patterns across cell and tissue types; we will train a supervised learning method for predicting both constitutive and tissue-specific chromatin conformation information based on chromatin state information, individual chromatin marks, genomic distance, activity, regulatory motif information, and DNA sequence; and we will use these higher-order interaction maps to predict gene expression levels based on the combined action of multiple regulatory regions and to define the cis-regulatory architecture of each gene in the human genome. The resulting resources will be invaluable for studies of gene regulation, by revealing the set of regulatory elements that are linked to each gene, and for the interpretation of genetic studies, by revealing the set of regulatory elements which jointly act to regulate each target gene and the potential target genes of non-coding variants associated with human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have generated a collection of 4000+ epigenomics datasets across 200+ cell and tissue types, which can be invaluable to the scientific community, but novel computational analyses are needed to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health. To address this need, we propose to systematically study epigenomic differences between cell types, lineages, and stages of differentiation, and to learn models predicting the higher-order chromatin structures across cell/tissue types, within each cell/tissue, and the chromatin architectures that they define. By systematically interpreting epigenomic annotations in the context of their cellular differentiation and their higher-order chromatin structures, the resultin resource will greatly increase their impact on human health by enabling disease studies to understand the mechanistic relationship between non-coding variants and their target genes, and the specific differentiation stages in which they act.",Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets,9038385,R01GM113708,"['Algorithms ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Health ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Enhancers ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' experience ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' ward ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Higher Order Structure ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Folding ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Structure ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Collection ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' comparison group ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' human disease ', ' comparative ', ' epigenome ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' Genetic study ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2016,284106,0.08421345851064095
"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important. We propose detailed characterization of cell-type appropriate genome-wide regulatory sequence catalogs, isolating labeled dopaminergic neurons ex vivo at multiple time points (Aim 1). We will functionally validate the catalogs and define the sequence motifs that specify their function, developing computational classifiers to identify human DA enhancers, and assaying the functional impact of disease-associated variants therein (Aim 2). We will determine the relationship between distal-acting regulatory sequences and their cognate genes using cutting edge chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based strategies to reveal enhancers- promoter interactions. Then we will determine the consequences of deleting selected enhancers using contemporary genome editing strategies (Aim 3). This proposal takes crucial next steps towards a neuronal regulatory lexicon that can inform our observation of disease-associated variation in non-coding, putative regulatory sequence space. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We wish to better understand how the regulatory instructions are encoded in DNA sequence, telling critical genes when and where to be switched on/off. We will focus on neurons that are lost in disorders like Parkinson's disease, prioritizing the study o genes implicated in related disorders. Our work will provide new insight into the identity, composition and biological requirement for these gene switches, informing our understanding of mutations that contribute to common genetic

"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases. Here, we gather data from multiple cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and develop a novel statistical framework for integrative analysis of data across individuals, cell types, and time points. Our approach provides a transformative approach for understanding gene regulation and the effects of genetic variation on individual health.  ",Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation,9157021,R01GM120167,"['Affect ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ectoderm ', ' Elements ', ' Endoderm ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Germ Layers ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human Genetics ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Mesoderm ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' training transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Individual ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' Genetic ', ' Staging ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Supporting Cell ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Outcome ', ' transcriptomics ', ' human disease ', ' pluripotency ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' human genomics ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' genomic data ', ' ']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,404036,0.13203592420148638
"Discovery of pathogenic germline variants in pediatric cancers using genomics. Project Summary/Abstract Genomic alterations drive cancer development in pediatric and adult patients, but pediatric cancers display a relative scarcity of somatic variants. This observation coupled with the earlier age of onset in familial cancer syndromes suggests that germline variants contribute to the development of many pediatric cancers. Many known pathogenic germline variants exhibit biological features such as loss of heterozygosity and rarity within the general population; certain germline cancer-causing variants also cause cancer when acquired somatically. Identifying pathogenic germline variants from whole exome sequence (WES) data would clarify the pathogenesis of pediatric cancers, and might support improved treatments for cancer subtypes with poor prognosis such as relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), high-grade glioma (glioma), and ependymoma. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the role of germline variants in pediatric cancer development using genomic data. The objective of this application is to develop a computational biology tool that identifies pathogenic germline variants from WES data, and to apply this tool to analyze germline variants in relapse ALL, glioma, and ependymoma. This application's central hypothesis is that pathogenic germline variants have biological and cohort-specific features that distinguish them from benign variants, such that a machine learning pipeline trained on these features can predict pathogenic germline variants. Aim 1 will call germline variants in WES data from 1) pediatric patients with known cancer-causing germline variants and 2) control patients without cancer; patients in data set 1) are randomly divided into a training and test set. A bioinformatics pipeline will call variants, add annotation, and filter out low quality variants. Aim 2 will use the training set to train and optimize a machine-learning algorithm to predict high confidence germline driver variants. Aim 3 will apply the final pipeline to validation sets of pediatric relapsed ALL, glioma, and ependymoma samples. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that predicts pathogenicity of germline variants using a pediatric cancer cohort, enabling improved understanding of the contribution of germline variants to multiple pediatric cancers. Project Narrative Improved understanding how certain germline DNA variants (those DNA changes that are inherited or occur early in development) promote cancer might lead to better treatments for pediatric cancers. However, identifying which germline variants cause cancer is challenging without genetic information from family members. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational tool that learns from germline variants known to cause cancer and then predicts cancer-causing variants from pediatric cancer patient DNA sequences in the absence of family information; these predicted variants will undergo computational and experimental testing, and may clarify how pediatric cancers like relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, glioma, and ependymoma develop.",Discovery of pathogenic germline variants in pediatric cancers using genomics.,9195404,F31CA210607,"['abstracting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Control Groups ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' WHO Grade II Ependymal Tumor ', ' WHO Grade II Ependymal Neoplasm ', ' Ependymoma ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Glioma ', ' Goals ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' acute lymphomatic leukemia ', ' acute lymphogenous leukemia ', ' acute lymphatic leukemia ', ' Precursor Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphoid Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' ALL -

"Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Over the past 10 years human genetics studies made unprecedented numbers of discoveries relating genome variation to common diseases. While it is unquestionably true that we have learned substantially from the discoveries made to date, we must also acknowledge that with respect to the identification and characterization of the genome variation affecting risk of common human diseases - those accounting for the overwhelming majority of public health care expenditures - our discoveries have not generated nearly the knowledge of disease etiology that we would have expected given the sheer number of these discoveries. The combination of these observations coupled with the dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing is driving the case for moving to whole genome sequencing studies for common disease. We have focused our application on three critical challenges for methods development and analysis of whole genome sequence data. While there has been substantial progress in methods development for analysis of exome sequencing, with gene-based tests that are relatively robust to the direction of effects of rare coding variants as well as the proportionof the gene's rare variants contributing to phenotype, it is clear that methods integrating the analysis of common and rare variation as well as functional genomics data will be essential for appropriate analysis of whole genome sequence data. Thus, we propose in Specific Aim 1 to develop novel methods, software and analysis pipelines for integrated analysis of common and rare variants for the analysis of whole genome sequence on 50,000- 100,000 individuals for any given common disease, and in Specific Aim 2 to develop and apply novel approaches for prioritizing results from these large-scale sequencing studies using BioVU, the 200,000 member biobank at Vanderbilt that is associated with 30 years of high quality electronic health records, and in Specific Aim 3 to develop queriable results databases and a comprehensive web portal to serve results of our studies on the sequence data for both the internal sequencing community and for the broader scientific community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies are being carried out to understand the genetic architecture of human complex diseases. It remains challenging to decipher the genetic mechanisms of disease etiology. In this application we aim to develop a suite of statistical and computational methods to identify genes and variants associated with complex disease and use BioVU, a DNA BioBank linked to electronic health records, to validate and investigate genetic architecture of multiple complex diseases.            ","Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases",9132585,U01HG009086,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Communities ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Genetic ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' pleiotropism ', ' success ', ' expectation ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' gene testing ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' functional genomics ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Data ', ' Large-Scale Sequencing ', ' Validation ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' NHGRI ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' disease phenotype ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' cost ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Coupled ', ' human disease ', ' public health relevance ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' exome sequencing ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' Genetic study ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' human genomics ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' genomic data ', ' ']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,854333,0.08926021278842002
"An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease result from platelet thrombus formation at the site of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. Numerous studies have shown enhanced platelet reactivity, and increased platelet count and volume are risk factors for CHD events and fatality, and a recent NHLBI Working Group concluded that variation in platelet reactivity is a major determinant of ischemic events, like MI or stroke. Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous common genetic variants associated with the risk of CHD and platelet function parameters, but most of the positive ""hits"" are not causative of the phenotype. To understand the cellular mechanisms by which these variants affect platelet function it is imperative to know the repertoire of mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs expressed in the cell of interest. Our team has been a leader in the field of platelet transcriptomics as well as functional assessment of variants in platelet genes. We have profiled mRNAs and miRNAs from 183 subjects using multiple platforms and have also performed platelet RNA-seq on 14 different subjects. This information provides a critical ability to filter, prioritize and obtain variant functional insights for evaluating GWAS SNPs associated with MI, stroke and platelet parameters. We have identified 142 mRNAs and 9 miRNAs that are expressed in platelets and linked to these GWAS hits. The goals of this proposal are to identify, assay, and validate functional variation previously tagged in GWASs of platelet-mediated ischemic arterial disease and of platelet phenotypes. Aim 1 will identify GWAS-linked mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs that are functional in platelets. Candidate RNAs will be refined by association with platelet function, eQTLs and QTLs using our previously generated platelet RNA data. We will develop a supervised machine-learning, statistical pattern matching algorithm to prioritize likely platelet-functional genes. Gene-level assays in which we knock down mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA in our human megakaryocyte culture system, followed by assays for integrin activation and quantification of platelet number and volume will be used to confirm platelet functionality. Aim 2 will identify functionally divergent SNPs and haplotypes. We will impute missing SNPs and perform fine-mapping to the phenotypes of interest. Variants will be prioritized by association strength, annotation data, and predicted function using publically available resources and our own platelet eQTL data. Non-coding candidates will be tested by reporter gene assay and non-synonymous variants will be tested using functional assays in cell lines in which the endogenous gene has been silenced. We will validate our findings with a replication analysis in which we use an independent cohort dataset to quantify the association of the tested variants with the original GWAS phenotype. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Platelet-mediated arterial thrombosis in the coronary or cerebrovascular circulation is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in the U.S. Numerous DNA variations have been associated with these disorders, but the causal genes are unknown. This research will test whether genes near these DNA variations - and candidate variations themselves - alter platelet function or number to understand better the molecular mechanisms causing heart attacks and strokes.",An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke,9115225,R01HL128234,"['cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Thrombosis ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Enhancers ', ' Mediating ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Thrombus ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' cohort ', ' UTRs ', ' Untranslated Regions ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Sentinel ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' HPCA1 ', ' CD34 ', ' CD34 gene ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Rupture ', ' Coupled ', ' transcriptomics ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' screening ', ' transcriptome ', ' inter-individual variation ', ' interindividual variation ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' platelet disorder ', ' platelet disease ', ' Thrombocytopathy ', ' Blood Platelet Disorders ', ' thrombocyte/platelet ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Platelets Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', "" Hayem's elementary corpuscle "", "" Deetjeen's body "", "" Bizzozero's corpuscle/cell "", ' Blood Platelets ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' brain blood flow ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Coronary Circulation ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' vulnerable plaque ', ' atherosclerotic plaque ', ' atherosclerotic lesions ', ' atherosclerosis plaque ', ' Atheromatous plaque ', ' Atheromatous degeneration ', ' Atheromatous ', ' Atheroma ', ' Arterial Fatty Streaks ', ' Arterial Fatty Streak ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Integrins Extracellular Matrix ', ' Integrins ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Introns ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' Megalokaryocyte ', ' Blood megakaryocyte ', ' Megakaryocytes ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recognized as an extremely common disorder that results in excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of automobile crashes. It is also an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiovascular events, increased cancer rates and cancer mortality, and accelerates the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. OSA is a systemic disorder and the cyclical intermittent hypoxia that occurs during sleep affects every organ system. OSA is heritable, with first degree relatives of individuals with OSA having a two-fold increased risk of the disorder. Although this has been known for over two decades, there are very limited data on gene variants conferring risk or protection for OSA. This is likely the result of underpowered studies and GENETIC HETEROGENEITY. There are multiple pathways to OSA. Obesity is a major risk factor, as are craniofacial dimensions. The relative risk of these different risk factors varies by ethnic group. There are also neuronal mechanisms and other physiological risk factors. This proposal seeks to directly address the issue of genetic heterogeneity using a very large sample of patients and state-of- the-art analysis techniques. Towards this end, we have assembled by far the largest sample of well characterized and genotyped patients with OSA. This is the result of collaboration with key sites in the eMERGE Network [Geisinger, Vanderbilt, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern], Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania. We propose to carry out a robust genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using an electronic health record (EHR) derived case definition and quantitative trait analysis of OSA severity. We will use novel machine learning approaches to specifically address genetic heterogeneity. The GWAS approach will be complimented by a PheWAS strategy as another approach to identifying common variants and related clinical phenotypes. Specifically, we will look for variants that associate with OSA and other clinical diagnoses in the EHR. It is likely that gene variants for OSA will have pleiotropic effects. Gene variants identified from GWAS and/or PheWAS will be further assessed. First, we will use available whole exome sequencing data to see if there are relevant rare variants in these genes, as well as to perform exploratory discovery analyses to look for novel rare variation. The functional role of the genes identified will be studied by functional network analysis. Finally, we will assess associations with quantitative data on intermediate traits identified by high throughput craniofacial and intra-oral photography. These data are currently available within the Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium (SAGIC). Future directions will assess the function of the genes identified in model systems and the clinical utility of utilizing variants as part of risk stratification for OSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with multiple adverse consequences. It is known that OSA has a genetic basis, but to date no convincing gene variants have been identified. This study uses state of the art approaches to identifying relevant genes based on a very large sample of patients with OSA obtained from multiple institutions in the United States. It is by far the largest study ever proposed for identifying genes for this common sleep disorder.",Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea,9177170,R01HL134015,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automobiles ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Bladder ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Learning ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methodology ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' mortality ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Phenotype ', ' Photography ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sleep ', ' sleep-related breathing disorder ', ' Sleep-Disordered Breathing ', ' Sleep Hypopnea ', ' Sleep Apnea ', ' Sleep Apnea Syndromes ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' soft tissue ', ' Individual ', ' Oxygen Deficiency ', ' Hypoxic ', ' Hypoxia ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Genetic Heterogeneity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' Syndrome, Sleep Apnea, Obstructive ', ' Obstructive Sleep Apnea ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neuro-degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' pleiotropism ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Excessive daytime somnolence ', ' Excessive Daytime Sleepiness ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' sleep problem ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Genomics ', ' Institution ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Collection ', ' 1st degree relative ', ' First Degree Relative ', ' Process ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Population ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' gene discovery ', ' discover genes ', ' high risk ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' phenome ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' exome sequencing ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' precision medicine ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' genotyped patients ', ' genomic data ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,740775,0.057001652686760766

"Predicting causal non-coding variants in a founder population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In order to characterize the molecular and cellular causes of human disease, it will be essential to unravel the functional impact of genetic variation. However, we are currently unable to predict the impact of the majority genetic variants that lie in non-coding regions of the genome, where indeed most complex disease-associated variants are found. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that a significant fraction of the non-coding genome is likely to be functional, often playing a role in gene regulation. Therefore, our limited understanding of non- coding variation is a critical hurdle to characterizing the genetic basis of disease. The goal of this project is to develop methods for interpreting non-coding genetic variation: to provide a robust and extensible Bayesian method for predicting causal variants from full genomes, to identify and validate a large set of functional non- coding variants using CRISPR technology, and to predict disease-relevant traits likely to be affected by each variant. Our project will leverage a unique cohort from a founder population in Sardinia, with genome sequence and/or transcriptome data available from 3000 individuals, along with extensive phenotyping for hundreds of traits. We will combine advanced statistical modeling with experimental validation based on genome engineering to identify causal non-coding variants affecting biomedical traits in the cohort, along with predicting functional mechanisms through which these variants ultimately perturb the cell. In Aim 1, we develop computational methods for predicting causal non-coding variation from full genomes, incorporating informative genomic features including epigenetic data, sequence motifs, and conservation information into a Bayesian approach jointly modeling multiple transcriptomic signals. We will optimize and apply these methods on genome and transcriptome data available for the Sardinia cohort to identify a large set of variants predicted to causally affect gene expression. Based on these predictions, in Aim 2, we connect putative causal variants with the diverse set of disease-relevant traits measured in the cohort, using network inference to capture the cascade from genetic variation to gene expression to disease. We will develop methods to integrate across variants, using the models in Aim 1, to identify the common causal mechanisms related to each trait. In Aim 3, we validate the causal impact of non-coding variants predicted to affect high-level traits. We will us genome editing through CRISPR to introduce individual genetic variants into cell lines and use qPCR to validate the predicted effects on gene expression. Finally, a major goal throughout this proposal will be to provide the research community with convenient computational tools for the prediction of causal non-coding variants from individual genomes, updated on an ongoing basis to integrate the most recent genomic annotations and public data in order to provide the best possible accuracy in predicting causal variants and the traits they are likely to affect. Our projet will greatly advance our understanding of non-coding genetic variation, the specific mechanisms affected by causal variants, and the downstream consequences to the cell and individual health.

"GWAS TO GENE FUNCTION: NOS1AP AND OTHER QT INTERVAL GENES DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the electrographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait that impacts the risks of long QT syndrome and sudden cardiac death, have identified 68 independent variants at 35 loci, explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance. Nevertheless, the identity, function and mechanisms of action of the underlying DNA sequence variants and genes remain unknown, and are major impediments for understanding the molecular structure and functional architecture of this complex phenotype. We hypothesize that the majority of functional trait variants are polymorphic, non-coding and perturb transcription of a specific gene by altering the functions of their cis-regulatory elements. We propose a research paradigm for systematically identifying these non-coding trait variants, the regulatory functions they disrupt and the specific genes whose functions are altered at each quantitative trait locus. We will utilize integrative statisticl genetic, computational, molecular genetics and cellular approaches for elucidating the underlying mechanisms, using QT interval as a model 'system'. Our specific aims are: (1) to perform high- resolution mapping of GWAS signals to identify all polymorphic (>1%) and rare variants at loci that modulate the QT-interval; (2) to conduct in silico and in vitro analysis to predict and prioritize all cardiac regulatory (enhancer, silencer, insulator) elements and their cognate DNA-binding proteins; and, (3) to identify trait variants, genes and their mechanisms of genetic action.

"Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genetic code not only determines protein amino acid residue sequence but also defines the 'splicing code' of cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements that control pre-mRNA splicing. Single nucleotide variant (SNV) changes at key regions in pre-mRNA may disrupt splicing resulting in disease [1, 2]. Understanding which SNVs cause aberrant splicing and which are benign is important for understanding disease pathogenesis. SNVs at consensus splice sites, at exon-intron junctions, are known to cause aberrant splicing and contribute to at least 10% of inherited diseases [2]. However, SNVs outside consensus splice sites can still disrupt splicing [3]. Current, bioinformatics tools limit analysis to SNVs at or near consensus splice sites and lack the ability to generalize to SNVs beyond the consensus splice site [4-7]. In this application, I propose to substantially improve the ability to interpret the consequences of mutations on pre-mRNA splicing. This goal will be achieved by: 1) developing novel features, useful in predicting the impact of variation on cis- splicing regulation; 2) training a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses the novel features to predict the impact of SNVs; 3) sharing the algorithm in a publically available software package; and 4) comparing algorithm predictions to the relationships between SNVs and splicing patterns derived from matched DNA- and RNA-sequencing studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic sequences not only encode the amino acids of proteins but also regulate many critical biological functions, including pre-mRNA splicing. The impact of genetic variation on splicing is not well understood. The goal of this research project i to computationally identify features of variants useful in predicting aberrant splicing, then incorporate the features into a machine learning algorithm and test the utility of the predictions using publically available sequencing studies. 1            ",Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing,8991662,F31HG007804,"['Algorithms ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Comparative Study ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Exons ', ' Genetic Code ', ' Goals ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Introns ', ' Methods ', ' premRNA ', ' RNA, Messenger, Precursors ', ' Pre-mRNA ', ' mRNA Precursor ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Benign ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Genomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Transcript ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' public health relevance ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' ']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,43576,0.08626086615978601
"F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-to-patient variability in response to drugs creates a significant challenge for the safe and effective treatment of many human diseases. Pharmacogenomics seeks to address this challenge by linking drug response to patient genotypes at important loci, termed pharmacogenes, in order to better customize patient treatments. Genetic variation in pharmacogenes is extensive. For example, amongst 12 CYP genes, 10% of people carry at least one rare, potentially deleterious variant. Unfortunately, only a small number of variants have been unambiguously linked to alterations in drug response. Clearly, new approaches are needed to annotate the consequences of the huge pool of variants of unknown significance, including those already identified by existing large-scale sequencing programs, and those that will be discovered as clinical sequencing becomes routine. In this proposal, we seek to address this problem directly and at a scale never before possible by taking advantage of new technologies in sequencing and functional analysis. Our resource, termed F-CAP (Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes) will test all possible substitutions at all amino acid residues in some of the most clinically important pharmacogenes and disseminate these data to the medical and research communities. In order to accomplish this, we will use deep mutational scanning, a method we have developed that allows parallelized, and quantitative measurements to be performed on libraries of genetic variants. In Aim 1 we will create these libraries, starting with five of the most important CPIC level A or B priority genes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, TPMT and VKORC1), and test the stability and enzymatic activity of each variant en masse using a pooled selection strategy. In Aim 2, we will integrate these data to create an impact score. This impact score provides a numerical value for a variant's functional effects that is amenable to easy integration into prescribing guidelines being developed by the pharmacogenomics community. Aim 3 will validate this score for a subset of variants that span the impact score spectrum using therapeutically relevant substrates for each pharmacogene. Finally, Aim 4 describes a key component of this resource: the dissemination of our findings to the entire pharmacogenomics community through partnership with CPIC and PharmGKB. In addition, we will make available our raw and processed data via a custom web resource that will also be developed in Aim 4. This resource will provide a series of fully annotated datasets describing the functional consequences of every possible single mutation in a series of key pharmacogenes, thereby greatly advancing the field of personalized medicine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pharmacogenomics seeks to identify genetic sources of inter-individual variability in drug response, with the goal of personalizing drug selection and dose to improve patient outcomes. A key barrier to using pharmacogenomic information is lack of clarity about the functional impact of variants, which hampers the provision of clear, unambiguous guidance to health care providers. We propose to connect pharmacogenomic variant discovery with novel high-throughput experimental approaches to deliver a resource to guide the use of individual pharmacogenomic information in personalizing drug treatment.",F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes,9110269,R24GM115277,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cataloging ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' In Vitro ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Scanning ', ' Source ', ' interest ', ' genetic diagnosis ', ' genetic disorder diagnosis ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' response ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' P450C2C ', ' Mephenytoin 4-Prime Hydroxylase ', ' Cytochrome P450, Subfamily IIC, Polypeptide 19 ', ' CYP2C19 ', ' CYP2C ', ' CYP2C19 gene ', ' Cytochrome P450, Subfamily IIC, Polypeptide 9 ', ' CYP2C9 ', ' CYP2C9 gene ', ' Subfamily IID-Like 1 Cytochrome P450 ', ' Subfamily IID Cytochrome P450 ', ' Sparteine Monooxygenase ', ' P450DB1 ', ' P450C2D ', ' P450-DB1 ', ' P450-2D6 ', ' Imipramine 2-Hydroxylase ', ' Debrisoquine Hydroxylase ', ' Debrisoquine 4-Monooxygenase ', ' Debrisoquine 4-Hydroxylase ', ' Cytochrome P450 Subfamily IID Polypeptide 6 ', ' Cytochrome P450 2D6 ', ' Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 ', ' CYPIID6 ', ' CYP2DL1 ', ' CYP2D6 ', ' CYP2D ', ' CYP 2D6 ', ' CPD6 ', ' CYP2D6 gene ', ' TPMT ', ' TPMT gene ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Mutate ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' Large-Scale Sequencing ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Numerical value ', ' Output ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' user-friendly ', ' human disease ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' stability testing ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' High-Throughput DNA Sequencing ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' genetic information ', ' variant of unknown significance ', ' variant of undetermined significance ', ' variant of uncertain significance ', ' variant of uncertain clinical significance ', ' unclassified variant ', ' clinical sequencing ', ' clinically actionable ', ' genotyped patients ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R24,2016,747826,0.1689453685449453
"PROMOTERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.",PROMOTERS,9066171,R01GM092910,"['Affect ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Elements ', ' Explosion ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Health ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' RNA Polymerases ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases ', ' DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase ', ' Specificity ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stem cells ', ' Testing ', ' Thermodynamic ', ' Thermodynamics ', ' Time ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Measures ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Funding ', ' Reporter ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' empowered ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' cell engineering ', ' cellular engineering ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Chromosome Positioning ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Collection ', ' To specify ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' combinatorial ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' gDNA ', ' genome editing ', ' genomic editing ', ' synthetic genomics ', ' chromosomal location ', ' chromosome location ', ' chromosomal position ', ' ']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,397299,0.03373204738570703
"Integrative interpretation of the organismal consequences of non-coding variation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our capacity to sequence human genomes has exceeded our ability to interpret genetic variation, particularly in non-coding regions. To address this challenge, we recently developed a novel framework, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD), for estimating the deleteriousness of any genetic variant. CADD defines an objective, data-rich, and quantitative integration of many genomic annotations into a single measure of variant effect at the organismal level. The goals of this R01 proposal are to further develop the CADD framework, to apply it in the context of ongoing genetic studies of both rare and common human diseases, and to experimentally evaluate its predictions. In Specific Aim 1, we will substantially modify CADD in both straightforward and creative ways, with the goal of dramatically improving CADD's ability to annotate non- coding variants, not only to estimate their organismal effects but also to provide insights into molecular mechanisms. In Specific Aim 2, we will apply CADD to a variety of ongoing whole genome sequencing studies of human disease, especially those in which non-coding variants are either known or suspected to be causal. As part of this effort, we will develop new statistical frameworks that directly incorporat CADD into traditional genome-wide discovery approaches. In Specific Aim 3, we will perform a combination of high-throughput (massively parallel reporter assays), medium-throughput (CRISPR/Cas9), and low-throughput (in vivo mouse transgenics) experimental assays for systematic and targeted assessment of CADD predictions. This proposal includes both computational and experimental innovations, and builds on established collaborative relationships between investigators with complementary strengths. The completion of our aims will yield novel methods, data, and resources with which to annotate whole genome sequences, broadly enabling the field to more effectively identify and mechanistically understand non-coding genetic variants that are causally relevant to human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As we enter an era of personalized medicine, a deep understanding of human genomes will be increasingly important to public health, contributing to the unraveling of the genetic basis of human disease, as well as serving an increasing role in clinical diagnostics. However, our limited understanding of the functional consequences of most genetic variants, especially those that do not alter protein sequence, represents a major obstacle. This proposal seeks to dramatically improve our ability to identify and interpret ""non-coding"" variants that causally contribute to human disease. A recently developed computational approach will be substantially improved and evaluated in a variety of genetic studies, and its predictions will be experimentally validated.

"Regulation of mRNA splicing by intronic genetic variants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic variations in introns commonly impact cellular functions by causing alterations in mRNA splicing. The abnormal inclusion and exclusion of exons often change protein functions and cellular phenotypes. Although many intronic variations have known functions, with the adoption of next generation sequencing, many more intronic variants have been discovered for which the functional impact is unknown. Thus, it is important to be able to predict the impact of the variants without needing to test them all in expensive and laborious assays. Although there are informatics algorithms that predict the impact of genetic variants on pre-mRNA splicing, their ability to predict the effect on protein function and ultimately disease and therapeutic phenotypes is lacking. In addition, there is a need for high-throughput cellular assays to test the results of these predictions on cellular functions. The studies proposed here will fulfill these needs by developing algorithms that prioritize the intronic variants by their potential impact on splicing and gene function, and developing a high-throughput assay to functionally test thousands of these predictions. These novel technologies will be applied to the effect of intronic variants on the pharmacogenomics of two clinically important oncology drugs, clofarabine and paclitaxel. Our long-term goals are to be able to predict the functional impact of genomic variants on human disease and therapeutic response. Our central hypothesis is that intronic genetic variants alter mRNA splicing and consequently protein function that ultimately affects the cellular response to drug therapy. Our first aim will be to develop computational algorithms that prioritize intronic variants based on their impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Using a variety of genomic and structural features and large sets of genomic data, we will develop a bioinformatics algorithm specifically designed to prioritize intronic variants based on their potential impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Our second aim will be to identify functional intronic variants associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. Using existing genomics and cellular cytotoxic response data from populations of human cell lines, we will identify functional intronic variants that contribute to individuals' responses to clofarabine and paclitaxel cytotoxicity. Our third aim will be to functionally test the impact of the prioritized intronic variants on pre-mRNA splicing and drug cytotoxicity. Using our novel high- throughput functional splicing assay, we will test the effects of predicted functional variants from Aim 2 on pre- mRNA splicing. In addition, we will validate the effect of the intronic variants on cytotoxicity using exon specific siRNA and CRISPR/Cas technology to manipulate the target gene splicing. Upon completion of these studies, we expect to have developed bioinformatics algorithms that can accurately prioritize the intronic variants based on their functional impact on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Also, we will have tested thousands of variants in a cellular pre-mRNA splicing assay and validated the impact of several of these functional variants on paclitaxel and clofarabine cytotoxicity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative The goal of this project is to design and implement a set of bioinformatics algorithms and high-throughput experimental assays for prioritizing functional intronic variants that contribute to phenotypic differences by affecting pre-mRNA splicing. The developed model, including a molecular validation component, will be used to systematically evaluate the functions of such variants that are associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. The same strategy can also be used to study the etiology of complex diseases.

"Functional genetic variations in splicing regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in disease genomes or across population. The next great challenge is to elucidate the potential function of various genetic variants in biological an disease processes. An important type of functional variants consists of those that affect gene expression in cis. Indeed, cis-regulatory variants are involved in a broad range of diseases and they showed a consistently stronger influence on gene expression than trans-acting determinants. Alternative splicing is an essential mechanism via which cis-regulatory changes may occur. Previous studies estimated that 15- 60% of point mutations that result in human genetic diseases disrupt splicing, highlighting the importance of this regulatory step. In addition to the well-known splice site signals, splicing is closely regulated by many exonic or intronic cis elements, associated with trans-acting proteins. Disruption of these cis-regulatory elements can cause aberrant splicing. Yet this crucial regulatory aspect remains largely unexplored. We propose to combine computational, genomic and molecular approaches to study splicing changes due to genetic variations. The specific aims are: (1) To globally identify exons and genes that are under differential splicing regulation by the alternative alleles of genetic variant, via bioinformatic analysis of high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome profiles (RNA-Seq). (2) To identify causal genetic variants in splicing alteration using minigene-based experiments.

This project will elucidate functional cis-regulatory genetic variants in splicing and provide significant insight ino the involvement of genetic variations in human diseases. In addition, this work will generate valuable bioinformatic tools to make full use of the increasingly available RNA-Seq data in a wide variety of cell types for identification and prediction of disease-related genetic variants. Aberrant splicing can significantly alter gene expression and contribute to human diseases.

"Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical genetic testing has become standard-of-care for many diseases including hundreds of inherited conditions. However, interpreting genetic test results is often confounded by the discovery of 'variants of unknown significance' (VUS) for which there is insufficient data or inadequate predictive tools to establish whether or not a particular variant predisposes to a disease. This problem is particularly vexing for genetic disorders with strong allelic heterogeneity and a preponderance of 'private' mutations such as the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), which predisposes young adults and children to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias. With the anticipated incorporation of personal exome or genome data into routine clinical care, interpreting VUS will become an even greater challenge especially when variants in genes associated with human disorders are incidentally discovered. Unfortunately, there are no reliable methods to predict a priori whether a given variant predisposes an individual to a particular disorder or whether the change is merely a benign rare variant. We propose to develop a novel paradigm for distinguishing disease-causing mutations from benign variants in LQTS as a model for other inherited arrhythmia syndromes and channelopathies. We will focus on variants in KCNQ1, the most commonly mutated gene in LQTS. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a holistic predictive model that relates experimentally determined protein structure and dynamics to function and disease is highly accurate even for novel variants. Our ultimate objectives are to develop a data-trained, web-accessible algorithm that classifies VUS discovered in KCNQ1 based on reliable predictions of the structure and dynamics of the affected protein, and to achieve prediction accuracy to levels needed to inform medical decisions. The medical importance of correctly classifying KCNQ1 variants provides strong justification for having a dedicated and highly-tailored gene-specific prediction model. The ability to distinguish deleterious from neutral variants would help avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in carriers of benign alleles, and save the lives of those with true mutations. We propose to collect extensive electrophysiological, biochemical and structural data on a large set of KCNQ1 variants discovered in LQTS subjects as well as several suspected benign or neutral variants (Aims 1-2), then use these data to iteratively train and validate a machine learning based algorithm that can differentiate benign from deleterious KCNQ1 alleles among a set of new VUS (Aim 3). Our proposal is innovative in the use of a multidisciplinary approach to functionally and structurally annotate genomic variant data for a medically important gene at an unprecedented scale, and then to use these experimental findings to train/test a novel computational system to achieve clinical-grade predictions. Targeting KCNQ1 will also validate an approach for parallel work that can be utilized to predict the medical significance of variants in closely related potassium channels associated with heritable epilepsy (KCNQ2, KCNQ3) or deafness (KCNQ4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a cause of sudden cardiac death in children and young adults. We propose a multidisciplinary experimental approach including electrophysiology, biochemistry and structural biology deployed on a large scale to generate information on at least 110 genetic variants in the main gene responsible for LQTS (KCNQ1), which encodes a potassium channel required for normal electrical activity in the heart. Our final product will be a data-trained computational strategy that will outperform existing methods for accurately predicting the functional consequences of novel KCNQ1 genetic variants, enhance the value of genetic testing in LQTS and provide for more informed medical decisions.",Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome,9111957,R01HL122010,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' arrhythmic agent ', ' antiarrhythmic agent ', ' Antiarrhythmic Drugs ', ' Antiarrhythmia Drugs ', ' Antiarrhythmia Agents ', ' Anti-Arrhythmics ', ' Anti-Arrhythmia Drugs ', ' Anti-Arrhythmia Agents ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biochemistry ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Deafness ', ' Sudden Death ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Genes ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Long QT Syndrome ', ' Methods ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Potassium Ion Channels ', ' K channel ', ' Potassium Channel ', ' Proteins ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Death, Sudden, Cardiac ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Stimulators, Electrical, Cardiac, Shock ', ' Electric Shock Cardiac Stimulators ', ' Defibrillators ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' cardiac rhythm ', ' heart rhythm ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Therapeutic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' structural biology ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Protein Trafficking ', ' protein transport ', ' trafficking ', ' Structure ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' gene testing ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Cell surface ', ' proband ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' genome sequencing ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' 1st degree relative ', ' First Degree Relative ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Molecular ', ' Cardiac ', ' protein function ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Implant ', ' web-accessible ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' standard of care ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' variant of unknown significance ', ' variant of undetermined significance ', ' variant of uncertain significance ', ' variant of uncertain clinical significance ', ' unclassified variant ', ' individual patient ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictive tools ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,1277210,0.15683172488267214
"Center for Multi- and Trans-ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) will identify genomic variants relevant to health and disease by genome sequencing over 225,000 participants across a multitude of diseases. The GSP will also serve as a pilot for the Precision Medicine Initiative that aims to enroll and sequence more than a million people representative of U.S. ethnic diversity. Here, we propose a GSP analysis center focused on Multi- and Trans- ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases. There is a growing recognition of the substantial scientific advantages, as well as public health importance, of conducting biomedical research across ethnically diverse cohorts. We propose to develop scalable methods that incorporate ancestry to optimize medical genomic study design and improve power for uncovering the role of common and rare variants in disease. Achieving this goal requires expertise across diverse domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for complex disease mapping, and expertise in management of large-scale databases. Here, we have assembled a world-class team of medical and population geneticists, computer scientists, statisticians and clinicians, with leading expertise in the development of novel and scalable strategies for characterizing sequence variants and their role in disease. Importantly, our group has been at the forefront of development of resources, study designs and methods to enable genomic research in U.S. minority populations. Our project has three main objectives. First, we will develop an Automated Scalable Ancestry Pipeline (ASAP) for common disease mapping in diverse populations. ASAP will improve the computational efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods for ancestry inference and develop important extensions to linear mixed models (LMMs) and other mapping strategies leveraging local and global ancestry. We will also develop methods to refine phenotypes and identify common controls for disease studies and define endpoints. Secondly, we will develop tools and resources for trans- and multi-population rare variant discovery that incorporate patterns of local and sub-continental ancestry. We will also develop machine-learning tools for variant annotation that leverage ancestral information, patterns of sequence evolution, and protein structure in a unified framework. Furthermore, we will incorporate population-specific patterns of cellular phenotypes to improve functional prediction algorithms for non-coding and coding variants. Lastly, we will disseminate our results through web-based resource that empower the biomedical research community. We will augment existing resources including ClinGen by annotating and characterizing pathogenic variants across diverse populations. We will develop a secure web-server that allows sharing of summary statistics and analysis pipelines to enable discovery, fine-mapping and functional prediction of genetic variants.

"Statistical and computational analysis in whole genome sequencing studies. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will investigate several issues arising from the statistical and computational analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) based genomics studies. In the area of data management in WGS studies, we address the rapidly increasing cost associated with the transfer and storage of the massive files for the sequence reads and their associated quality scores. We will develop data compression methods to achieve a further compression of several folds beyond current standards, with minimal incurred errors. In the area of secondary analysis, we will develop new statistical learning methods to improve variant quality score recalibration and to filter out unreliable calls. This will improve te reliability of the key information provided by the WGS data, which are the variants calls indicating the locations where the genome differs from the reference and the nature of the differences. We will study methods for case-control studies based on WGS. In particular, we will develop statistical models to enable the integrating of information from multiple types of variants to obtain more powerful tests of association. We will apply the methods developed in this aim to the analysis of WGS data from a study on abdominal aortic aneurysm. Finally, we will address selected new questions associated with population scale WGS projects. Several national programs have recently been initiated to generate WGS data for hundreds of thousands of individuals with longitudinal medical records. The availability of this comprehensive data on a population scale will open up a rich frontier for genome medicine and will pose many new challenges for statistical analysis. We will formulate some of these new challenges and develop the statistical methods needed to meet these challenges. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research in this project concerns the design and implementation of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of data from whole genome sequencing studies.

"Discovery and analysis of structural variation in whole genome sequences DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The whole genome sequencing of large cohorts of individuals is quickly becoming a common tool for researchers to investigate the genetic basis of many disease phenotypes. The primary goals are to discover the underlying genetic variation that cause or contribute to these diseases as well as to correctly identify these variants in a diagnostic setting. These differences typicall consist of single base changes (SNPs), but can also encompass larger, more complex chromosomal rearrangements in the form of structural variation (SV) which are much more difficult to detect even with modern sequencing technologies. A number of approaches have been published that have studied this problem, but even the largest scale endeavors have only focused on deletion events and reported a sensitivity of <70%. Complex chromosomal rearrangements are even less well studied. Thus, it is paramount that accurate methods are developed which can detect all types of SVs at high specificity from sequence data. This proposal aims to improve the overall ability of researchers to identify and analyze genetic variation from whole genome sequences. An important, and often overlooked, aspect of SV discovery is the fact that typical paired-end, read depth, and split read approaches will identify different sets of non-overlapping variants at varying degrees of accuracy. In Aim 1, we will develop a unified SV discovery algorithm that can incorporate all of these different sources of information in a probabilistic fashion. Such a method would be useful for research, in particular with the identification of rare variants, as well as clinical applications which require a great del of accuracy and have thus far been limited to older karyotyping and microarray approaches. This would identify the majority of structural variants, however there are many regions in genomic sequences which are complex in nature, defined as consisting of multiple neighboring or overlapping chromosomal rearrangements that are challenging to resolve with typical SV detection approaches. In Aim 2, we propose methods to resolve these complex regions and assess their frequency and impact. Furthermore, a crucial step in medical genetics is the comparison of identified genetic mutations to databases of known pathogenic and benign variants. This is currently problematic with SVs, as they have often been originally reported with varying degrees of breakpoint resolution that can hamper the correct assignment of the variant. This issue is compounded further in more complex regions with multiple breakpoints, for which simplistic comparison methods do not work well. In Aim 3, we will develop and implement a system that describes and utilizes variant profiles to identify whether an individual's sequence data contains a variant of interest. Overall, this project will advance our understanding of the human genome as well as provide tools for use in the general research and clinical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The rearrangement of chromosomal material in the form of structural variation is directly responsible for many disease phenotypes, however our ability to detect and resolve these events from whole genome sequence data is currently limited. We propose a number of strategies for improving the detection and analysis of structural genomic variation between individuals and resolving their underlying structure and function.

"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the 'early' detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to is development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to fine- map already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this two- stage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 ""convenience controls"" from the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the 'early' subclinical phenotypes identified through the use o VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1. Lastly, for the second part of Aim 3, we will investigate the potential function of KC variants by testing their ability to influence gene structure, expression and function in corneal cell models, including iPS cells derived from corneal keratocytes developed by our research team. The results of these studies will help advance our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to KC and may result in novel treatment options to slow the progression of the disease.

"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design Our Vision: We propose DeepLink, a versatile data translator that integrate multi-scale, heterogeneous, and multi-source biomedical and clinical data. The primary goal of DeepLink is to enable meaningful bidirectional translation between clinical and molecular science by closing the interoperability gap between models and knowledge at different scales. The translator will enhance clinical science with molecular insights from basic and translational research (e.g. genetic variants, protein interactions, pathway functions, and cellular organization), and enable the molecular sciences by connecting biological discoveries with their pathophysiological consequences (e.g. diseases, signs and symptoms, pharmacological effects, physiological systems). Fundamental differences in the language and semantics used to describe the models and knowledge between the clinical and molecular domains results in an interoperability gap. DeepLink will systematically and comprehensively close this gap. We will begin with the latest technology in semantic knowledge graphs to support an extensible architecture for dynamic data federation and knowledge harmonization. We will design a system for multi-scale model integration that is ontology-based and will combine model execution with prior, curated biomedical knowledge. Our design strategy will be iterative and participatory and anchored by 10 major milestones. In a series of demonstrations of DeepLink’s functions, we will address one of the major challenges facing translational science: reproducibility of biomedical research findings that are based on evolving molecular datasets. Reproducibility of analyses and replication of results are central to scientific advancement. Many landmark studies have used data that are constantly being updated, curated, and pared down over time. Our series of demonstrations projects are designed to prototype the technology required for a scalable and robust translator as well as the techniques we will use to close the interoperability gap for a specific use case. The demonstration project will, itself, will be a significant and novel contribution to science. DeepLink will be able to answer questions that are currently enigmatic. Examples include: - From clinicians: What is the comparative effectiveness of all the treatments for disease Y given a patient's genetic/metabolic/proteomic profile? What are the functional variants in cell type X that are associated with differential treatment outcomes? What metabolite perturbations in cell type Y are associated with different subtypes of disease X? - From basic science researchers: What is known about disease Y across all model organisms (even those not designed to model Y)? What are all the clinical phenotypes that result from a change in function in protein X? Which biological pathways are affected by a pathogenic variant of disease Y?

"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the ‘early’ detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to its development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to finemap already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this twostage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 “convenience controls” f rom the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the ‘early’ subclinical phenotypes identified through the use of VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1. Lastly, for the second part of Aim 3, we will investigate the potential function of KC variants by testing their ability to influence gene structure, expression and function in corneal cell models, including iPS cells derived from corneal keratocytes developed by our research team. The results of these studies will help advance our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to KC and may result in novel treatment options to slow the progression of the disease. Improving methods for the ‘early’ detection of keratoconus will help patients avoid complications of LASIK surgery, allow us to identify genetic variants that contribute to its development, and design therapies to retard its progression.",Genetic Factors in Keratoconus,9353966,R01EY009052,"['Affect ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cholesterol ', ' corneal ', ' Cornea ', ' corneal transplant ', ' corneal keratoplasty ', ' Corneal Transplantation ', ' Corneal Grafting ', ' Cornea Transplantation ', ' Keratoplasty ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discriminant Analyses ', ' Discriminant Analysis ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' ophthalmopathy ', ' eye disorder ', ' Eye diseases ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Grant ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' indexing ', ' Keratoconus ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Lasers ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' tomography ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Measures ', ' Family member ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Surface ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' In Situ ', ' Techniques ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' reverse transcriptase PCR ', ' RTPCR ', ' RT-PCR ', ' Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Videokeratography ', ' Videokeratographies ', ' novel ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' protein expression ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' therapy design/development ', ' genetic association ', ' Data ', ' Gene Structure/Organization ', ' Gene Organization ', ' Gene Structure ', ' Molecular ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' protein function ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' genome-wide linkage ', ' genomewide linkage ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' bead chip ', ' BeadChip ', ' ']",NEI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,100384,0.05142039150033942
"Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements Understanding of regulatory elements in the human genome is a key step in our ability to understand complex biological and disease systems. Regulatory elements are much more difficult to identify than genes and likely account for more variation among individuals than actual coding differences in genes. Identifying and studying elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, will lead to new therapeutic strategies as the complex regulatory networks are revealed. Up to now the characterization and validation of truly functional regulatory elements has been a low throughput endeavor as each regulatory site is cloned into a reporter assay and tested. This proposal produces a novel method that performs one of the most common validation assays, transient transfections, in a high-throughput manner by combining it with an innovative sorting and sequencing system. This system, which has been shown to be practical and feasible, will allow for rapid and thorough identification of the method of action of regulatory elements throughout the human genome.  The candidate's background in both computer science and molecular biology ranging from undergraduate to graduate school and post-doctoral work provides a complete background that should allow for implementation and extension of the described experiment in the post-doctoral environment. The nature of the science and the data produced should allow continuation and extension of the work as a new faculty member. Stanford and the Snyder lab provide an outstanding environment for a strong program allowing development of the candidate and preparation for transition to a long-term independent research career. As part of this program, the candidate will combine a mentoring committee with continuing education via available online courses.  The end result of both phases of the program will be scientific results that can be extended into useful and important medically and scientifically relevant areas as they relate to regulation of expression in humans. The innovative methods described will allow the candidate to pursue various lines of endeavor well past the end of this funding program. In turn the candidate will be positioned at the end of the program to function as an independent principle investigator and valuable collaborator. This project seeks to extend current assays demonstrating function of genomic regions into an equivalent genome-wide assay. Identification of the effect of these regions on gene expression will lead to a better understanding of the complex regulatory `code' dictating our cellular processes.

"Super-enhancer structure defines a signature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to decipher the genetic basis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with the chromatin modification information in human immune system. Accumulating evidence suggests that IBD results from an inappropriate inflammatory response to intestinal microbes in a genetically susceptible host. Among complex diseases, GWAS methods have been successful in IBD, identifying hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci. However, the majority of these disease-associated DNA variants fall into the gene-desert part of the genome, complicating their functional evaluation. There is now overwhelming evidence that the noncoding disease-associated DNA variants disrupt the action of key regulatory elements in relevant cell types. Since genomic coordinates of active regulatory elements can be charted using unique chromatin features, genome-wide profiling of chromatin modifications in relevant cell types can be used to pinpoint to DNA variants disrupting active regulatory elements.  Two recent studies discovered a novel kind of enhancers that occurs within exceptionally large genomic domains. These regions were initially dubbed as 'super-enhancers'. Super-enhancer domains occur at key identity genes in a variety of cell types. Strikingly, these enhancer domains are more sensitive to perturbation such as loss of transcription factors than typical shorter enhancers.  Because of the fragility of super-enhancers to perturbation, I postulate that super-enhancer domains of relevant immune cells harbor IBD-associated DNA variants. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 of this proposal, I will characterize super-enhancer structures of the human immune system. I will first develop an unsupervised machine learning technique to chart super-enhancer structures from histone acetylation (H3K27Ac) data in diverse immune cells. Using this technique, I will next delineate cell type- specific enhancer domains in the immune cells and investigate the relationship among cells types with respect to their super-enhancer structures. In Aim 2 of this proposal, I will investigate the enrichment of IBD-associated DNA variants within the super-enhancers of the most relevant immune cells. I then link these variants to genes and pathways that they regulate and are affected in disease utilizing gene expression and long-range chromatin interaction datasets. Completion of these aims, along with training opportunities associated with this proposal will establish the necessary foundation for my career as an independent investigator. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two common forms of (IBD), affect over 2.5 million people in North America and Europe. GWAS methods have identified hundreds of non-overlapping genetic risk loci in IBD. Yet, the functional effects of mos IBD-implicated variants remain largely unexplained. The finding that nearly 90% of these sites occur outside of protein-coding sequences suggests that many associated variants may instead have a role in gene regulation. Cell context is a key determinant of gene regulation but where IBD genetic variants are functional is largely unknown. This proposal seeks to utilize the chromatin structure of human immune cells to discover the cell context for IBD-associated variants. The identification of the pathogenic cell types as well as the molecular pathways that contribute to the disease will contribute greatly to our ability to treat patients.",Super-enhancer structure

"Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages Regulatory networks that control which genes are expressed when, are critical players in the maintenance and transitions of different cell states. In mammalian systems such networks are established by a complex interplay of thousands of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, chromatin remodelers and signaling proteins, histone post-translational modifications and three-dimensional organization of the genome. Hence, the identification of genome-scale regulatory networks and their changes remains a computational and experimental challenge, especially for rare and novel cell types. Through recent efforts of consortia projects we now have rich datasets measuring multiple components of the regulation machinery in model cell lines. These data enable the creation of a more complete regulatory network for these cell lines. Can we use this information to identify networks in new cell types where measuring only a few components of the regulation machinery is possible (e.g. the transcriptome)? Can we leverage more complete regulatory networks to predict new cell types, and to predict the effect of network perturbations to cellular state? To tackle these questions, in this proposal we will develop innovative network reconstruction methods to identify regulatory networks in novel and rare cell types by leveraging their relationships to well-studied cell types, as well as to each other. Our methods will use the framework of non-stationary graphical models to represent cell type-specific regulatory networks and will use multi-task learning to incorporate shared information between cell types in a lineage. Methods in Aim 1 will infer modular gene regulatory networks for each cell type and additionally refine an existing incomplete or uncertain lineage structure. Methods in Aim 2 will identify cell type-specific directed dependencies among chromatin state and transcription factors and how they impact target gene expression through proximal and long-range regulation. Our methods will be applied to two cell-fate specification problems: cellular reprogramming and multi-cell lineage forward differentiation. In cellular reprogramming, regulators and subnetworks hindering reprogramming efficiency will be predicted and tested using genetic perturbation experiments. In forward differentiation, regulatory network changes that drive alternate lineages will be identified and tested. Successful completion of this project will provide two broadly applicable software tools that will enable researchers to (i) accurately identify regulatory networks and their changes between different cell states in complex cell lineages, (ii) examine interactions among multiple levels of regulation and their impact on cell type-specific gene expression, and (iii) efficiently identify the most upstream regulatory genes and subnetworks that change cellular states. Software tools from this project will be made available and will be broadly applicable to diverse types of dynamic biological processes in development and disease. Project Narrative Many human diseases are due to aberrant activity of genes in specific cell types. Transcriptional regulatory networks specify what genes must be expressed in which cell types and play a central role in the type and function of cells. Therefore, the ability to identify these networks in each cell type and the network changes that result in changes in cell type is important for a better understanding of human health and disease. Computational methods that can identify regulatory networks and their dynamics across related mammalian cell types offer a powerful approach to create better models of human disease and for regenerative medicine.",Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages,9177501,R01GM117339,"['Algorithms ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' Correlation Studies ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Health ', ' Histones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Training ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Sample Size ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' Genetic ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' regulatory gene product ', ' Regulatory Protein ', ' genetic regulatory protein ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' cell fate specification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Signaling Pathway Gene ', ' Signaling Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Signaling Protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' human disease ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' epigenome ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' transcriptome ', ' genomic data ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2016,288612,0.07843373973118173
"EMERGE PHASE III CLINICAL CENTER AT PARTNERS HEALTHCARE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eMERGE III Clinical Center proposal from Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank, clinical data in the electronic medical records (EMR) for >4 million participants from the largest integrated health care provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise and state-of-the-art genetic analysis. We propose three aims. (1) Aim 1. Discovery. We will test the hypothesis that common and rare variants from a custom chip including 50,000 loss of function (LoF) alleles will be associated with cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric and immune-mediated phenotypes derived from the EMR. We are currently genotyping 25,000 Partners HealthCare Biobank subjects with a custom chip that includes LoF alleles from 63,000 exomes that we have analyzed. (2) Aim 2. Penetrance and Pleiotropy. We will test the hypothesis that sequencing a set of established genes or loci will allow us to discover additional variation, and define penetrance and pleiotropy using EMR phenotypes. Rare variants in genes selected by the eMERGE network will be studied for penetrance and pleiotropic outcomes by PheWAS and chart review. In addition, we are poised to perform recall-by-genotype studies because all Biobank participants have provided consent for such callback. (3) Aim 3. Implementation. We will test the hypothesis that physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based upon voluntary return of actionable variants to provide safe and cost-effective benefits to patients. We will screen our entire Biobank population of 25,000 individuals for pathogenic variants in the LDLR gene, the leading genetic cause of premature coronary artery disease, and conduct an exploratory trial in disclosing this information. Biobank participants with pathogenic variants in LDLR will be offered enrollment into a randomized trial, in which their finding will be CLIA-confirmed, and in one arm, this result will be communicated to their physicians through the EMR. Over one year, we will collect the following outcomes through participant surveys and EMR queries: physician visits, laboratory testing, changes in medication prescriptions, LDL levels, medical costs and the number of family members screened and treated as a result of the intervention. We will collaborate with the entire eMERGE III Network to incorporate what we learn from this pilot trial into large-scale implementation protocols for the genes selected by the Network for sequencing. Finally, we will participate in all Network activities to enhance the movement of genetics into clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The discovery and clinical use of genetic variants associated with both rare Mendelian and more common complex diseases promises to dramatically change the practice of medicine.

"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.

"Biomedical Computing and Informatics Strategies for Infectious Disease Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important goal of infectious disease research is to develop genetic predictors of susceptibility. Our success in this endeavor will depend critically on the informatics methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic and genomic data. The goal of this research program is to develop, evaluate, distribute and support new and novel biomedical computing algorithms and open-source software for identifying combinations of genetic predictors of clinically important infectious disease outcomes. This application will target the growing body of rare genetic variants identified by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our clinical application will focus on the prediction of antiretroviral response in clinical trials for HIV/AIDS. We propose here a highly innovative Hierarchical Rare Variant Collapsing Machine (HRVCM) algorithm for identifying and collapsing combinations of rare variants across gene regions (AIM 1). We will then integrate these new collapsed HRVCM variables into our popular Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method that will assess them in combination with common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genome-wide association studies or GWAS (AIM 2). Our novel HRVCM-MDR approach will, for the first time, make it possible to assess non-additive interactions among sets of rare and common variants simultaneously in genetic studies of infectious diseases. We will apply these new and novel methods to approximately 13 million rare and common variants from nearly 3000 subjects that participated in an AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) study to evaluate risk for virologic failure with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens (AIM 3). Finally, we will release all methods as open source to the biomedical research community through our freely available MDR software package (AIM 4).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this application is to develop innovative new computational methods for the genetic analysis of infectious diseases.

"Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genotyping and emerging sequencing technologies have enabled comprehensive interrogation of genetic variation across the human genome, thereby facilitating a study's ability to map genetic variants that influence phenotypes of interes. Nevertheless, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects have uncovered only a limited number of trait-influencing loci. While large increases in sample size will improve power to detect such variation, the ascertainment and sequencing/genotyping of such samples are costly and inefficient. Therefore, it is desirable to increase power to detect such variants without requiring additional sample collection. We propose novel methods for improved gene mapping of common and rare susceptibility variants that move beyond standard strategies typically applied to GWAS and NGS studies of complex traits. The first topic we consider is pleiotropic or cross- phenotype effects of genetic variants. Empirical studies have suggested that pleiotropy is widespread throughout the genome and that leveraging this additional information for gene mapping yields a more powerful analysis than an analysis that ignores such information. In Aim 1, we propose novel statistical methods for genetic analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data using an innovative kernel distance-covariance (KDC) framework that allows for an arbitrary number of phenotypes both continuous and/or categorical in nature, as well as an arbitrary number of genotypes (permitting gene-based testing of both rare and common variants). We will use the KDC framework to implement tests of pleiotropy as well as tests of mediation. The second topic we consider is the mapping of rare susceptibility variants using affected pedigrees, which provide many attractive features for rare-variant testing that case-control studies lack. In Aim 2, we propose a series of powerful statistical methods for rare-variant association testing in affected pedigrees that are based on a framework (recently published in AJHG) for rare-variant association testing in affected sibships. The existing framework compares rare-variant burden in a region by an affected sib pair to the number of regions that pairs shares identical by descent. We have shown the method is more powerful than case-control association testing given fixed sample size and further is robust to population stratification. In this proposal, we will extend the framework to handle affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure (rather than just affected sib pairs) and devise a powerful two-stage screening and validation strategy for rare-variant mapping that first compares familial cases in the pedigrees to external controls and then follows up the most interesting findings using an independent test based on our identity-by-descent sharing statistic among the affected relatives used in the first stage. We will apply the methods in Aims 1-2 to relevant data from genetic studies of complex traits in which we are directly involved. We also will implement the methods in public user-friendly software (Aim 3).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a set of statistical approaches to investigate two important topics in gene- mapping studies of complex human traits. First, we will develop techniques for identifying genes that have pleiotropic effects on phenotypes of possibly high dimension and further assess whether such genes have direct effects on such phenotypes or indirect effects through other possible factors. Second, we will develop tools to facilitate identification of rare polymorphic variation that increase risk for complex disease using data from affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure. We will evaluate these methods using simulated data and illustrate their value by applying them to genetic projects of complex traits in which we are actively involved. Application of the proposed methods to these datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of various complex traits.                ",Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits,9055844,R01GM117946,"['Affect ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' pedigree structure ', ' Pedigree ', ' genetic pedigree ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Risk ', ' Siblings ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic ', ' Genets ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' pleiotropism ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' gene testing ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' novel ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' genetic determinant ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' genetic association ', ' Applied Genetics ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' human disease ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' public health relevance ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' screening ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' Genetic study ', ' identity by descent ', ' identical by descent ', ' IBD inference ', ' IBD analysis ', ' ']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,309883,0.11673529291016699
"Understanding the functional impacts of genetic variants in mental disorders ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US, 46% are afflicted with a mental illness at some point of life. The management and treatment of mental disorders pose significant economical and social burden to the society. Many rare and common genetic variants, including SNPs and CNVs, are reported to be associated with mental disorders, yet more remain to be discovered. However, despite the large amount of high-throughput genomics data, there is a lack of integrative methods to systematically prioritize variants that confer susceptibility to mental disorders; additionally, despite the presence of many candidate variants for mental disorders, their disease-contributory mechanism remains elusive, so appropriate functional follow-up experiments cannot be designed. Altogether, these problems resulted in a large gap between the copious amount of data about genetic variation and our understanding of their functional impacts on mental diseases, which ultimately delays the development of targeted therapeutic approaches. To address these problems, we propose to develop a suite of novel bioinformatics approaches: (1) NeuroComplex, an information integration approach that leverages phenotype information and multiple sources of prior biological knowledge to rank genes by their likelihood of contributing to specific phenotypic presentations. (2) integrated MEntal-disorder GEnome Score (iMEGES), which leverages a two-layer strategy to predict the impacts of variants in personal genomes on mental disorders. The first layer uses machine learning algorithm to build variant deleteriousness scores for coding, non-coding and structural variants; the second layer integrates variant scores and NeuroComplex to assign pathogenicity scores. (3) a hierarchical model called CombOmics that incorporates cross-omics information to characterizes how variants confers disease risk, in order to help formulate hypothesis of pathogenicity and facilitate the design of functional follow-up experiments. (4) we will develop user-friendly software tools and web applications that implement all the aforementioned bioinformatics approaches, and continuously release and maintain these tools to ensure the maximum benefits to the scientific community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop novel informatics approaches to understand how genetic variation impacts various mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism.

As part of this aim we will identify transcription factor binding motifs tha are in the discovered regulatory vocabulary. We will validate and refine the causality of these models by testing whether they accurately predict the chromatin accessibility of thousands of synthetic DNA ""phrases"" that have been engineered into specific genomic locations and measured in the context of transcription factor gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. The phrases will be designed to elucidate both the factors and grammar that control chromatin opening in several distinct cellular states (Aim 2).

"Mechanisms underlying complex trait human disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now an explosion of new genome scale data relating genetic variation within the human population to phenotype, and particularly to common disease. Microarray technology has identified 100s of loci where the presence of particular variants is associated with altered risk of many common diseases; complete sequencing of individual exomes in cancer samples has discovered many somatic mutations in a variety of genes; and sequencing of 1000 human genomes has provided an almost complete inventory of common population variants. Further, these data are only the first in an ever-increasing flood, as even faster and cheaper sequencing technologies come on line. The results hold promise for major advances in treatment and diagnosis of common human diseases. Extracting the expected benefits is not straightforward, and will necessitate acquiring detailed knowledge of the mechanisms linking genetic variation to disease. This project focuses on one aspect of this challenge - using the new genomic data to identify new therapeutic opportunities. We will investigate those principles underlying complex trait disease that are particularly relevant to tha goal. We introduce a three stage mechanistic framework, relating genomic variation to the function of impacted gene products, the impact of these altered functions on pathways, processes and subsystems; and finally the consequences for complex trait disease phenotypes. We will develop computational methods to address key questions concerning three major aspects of the framework (1) How large are the changes in protein function brought about by the genomic variants underlying complex trait disease? What role do different classes of genomic and protein level mechanism, such as expression, non-synonymous changes and splicing, play in these variants? (2) How complete is the set genes with strong influence on the disease phenotypes discovered by current technologies, and how can missing genes be imputed from the genomic and network data? (3) What is the distribution of coupling between the activity of genes involved in disease mechanism and disease phenotypes? The results will deepen understanding of these aspects of complex disease, and provide a basis for identifying potential new drug targets from GWAS and other genomic studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New technologies are now providing extensive information on human genetic variation associated with increased risk of a wide range of common human disease, such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease, and many cancers. These data hold the promise for the development of new therapies, and realizing those benefits requires the acquisition of complementary knowledge of the mechanisms that link genetic variation to disease risk. This project is focused on analysis of the relationship between genetic variation and common disease with the goal of identifying new therapeutic opportunities.",Mechanisms underlying complex trait human disease,9068178,R01GM104436,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Explosion ', ' Flooding ', ' Floods ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Information Networks ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Risk ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Technology ', ' Translations ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' gene function ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' trait ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' microarray technology ', ' microarray analyses ', ' Microarray-Based Analysis ', ' Microarray Analysis ', ' Data ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' disease phenotype ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Coupling ', ' Heritability ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' therapeutic target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new drug target ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' exome sequencing ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' genetic information ', ' genomic variation ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' gene product ', ' genomic data ', ' ']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2016,288036,0.10459390289704756
"Computational methods for modeling lineage-specific gene regulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex sensory and signaling pathways ultimately converge on the DNA in the form of complexes of interacting regulatory RNAs and proteins that bind specific gene-proximal and distal regulatory elements to active and repress genes resulting in the establishment and maintenance of cell-type specific transcriptional responses. These regulatory elements have static and dynamic components - the former encoded in the genomic sequence itself as combinations of transcription factor binding site sequence motifs and the latter a consequence of locus and cell-type specific chromatin accessibility and epigenomic modifications as well as the dynamic linking of distal regulatory elements to target genes. In addition, transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback and control of the levels of regulatory proteins and RNAs also play a key role in dynamic cell-type specific gene regulation. One of the central challenges in modern genomics is to learn these rules by which the genome and epigenome encode regulatory information. How does a single genome sequence encode the information for exquisitely precise, and yet highly distinctive programs of gene regulation for different cell types, and at different time points? What are the key sequence determinants, and grammatical rules that determine the function of any given DNA sequence under any particular set of conditions? In this project we seek to use public data from The Roadmap Epigenomics project and The ENCODE project to make progress on these questions. We propose to build methods for interpreting shared and distinctive regulatory features, including especially transcription factor binding, across related cell types. In parallel, we will implement novel methods for identifying high-resolution, context-specific dynamic regulatory elements, decipher their underlying regulatory sequence grammars and learn predictive, integrative models of transcriptional regulation to decipher the effects of heterogeneous regulatory components on lineage-specific gene expression dynamics and provide regulatory annotations for large collections of curated and disease-associated gene sets. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this project is to develop powerful statistical methods to study cell-type specific gene regulation, and apply these to publicly available data from The Roadmap Epigenomics Project, The ENCODE Project and several publicly available gene expression compendia. We propose new methods for joint inference of regulatory elements across diverse cell types, deciphering lineage-specific regulatory sequence grammars encoded in these elements and learning integrative transcriptional regulation programs.

"Clinically Relevant Genome Variation Database We propose to create the world's premier database of genetic variants relevant to clinical care (Clinically Relevant Genetic Variants Resource or CRVR). We will provide transparent data synthesis and consensus opinion on the clinical utility of a given genetic variant across a spectrum of genetic lesions including single nucleotide changes, small indels and structural variants. We will integrate with ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM and draw upon NHGRI initiatives including the Genome Sequencing and Analysis and Mendelian Disorders Sequencing Centers, and the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Centers. We will work closely with other CRVR sites and NHGRI funded initiatives to improve deposition of data from clinical laboratories. Our database will be built through three Aims. Aim 1 will engage and energize the clinical genomics community around CRVR efforts. We will partner with the other CRVR and U41 investigators in this activity as they will focus on engagement of professional societies, clinical testing laboratories, and the broader clinical genomics community to ensure creation of a CRVR resource that meets anticipated community needs including assembly of Disease-Specific and Mutation Type Working Groups (DSWGs and MTWGs) comprised of expert clinical geneticists and molecular diagnosticians to establish metrics for the initial classification of variants and integration of guidelines from professional organizations. Aim 2 will involve creation of a CRVR CoreDB resource through expert review of the existing literature, locus databases, and NHGRI initiatives. We will disseminate consensus findings on clinically relevant genetic variants and the clinical implications of these variants, with supporting evidence and documentation of the consensus process. Information will be aggregated using standard ontologies and advanced methodologies for handling heterogeneous data to create a Core Database (CoreDB). The consensus of expert review will be disseminated through a user-friendly web Portal (vetted by Genetic Counseling WG), web services for data mining, and consensus clinical guidelines to the appropriate clinical and research communities. The results will be organized by gene, variant, disease, pathway, and literature. Supporting evidence will also be curated and disseminated, and the resource will be updated continuously as new information accumulates. Aim 3 will involve deployment of machine-learning algorithms for semi- automatic identification of putative Clinically Relevant Variants (CRVs). We will undertake data mining of the clinical and epidemiological genetics literature and existing databases to identify putative clinically important variants. This will involve mining data from ClinVar, OMIM, CSER, and the Mendelian centers aggregated in Aim 2.

"Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although investments in genomic studies of mental disorders enabled the discovery of thousands of robustly associated variants with these complex diseases, the translation of these discoveries into actionable targets has been hampered by the lack of a mechanistic understanding on how genome variation relates to phenotype. Moreover, it has been widely shown that a substantial portion of the genetic control of complex traits, including mental disorders, is exerted through the regulation of gene expression. However, effective methods to fully harness this mechanism are lagging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel gene-based test -PrediXcan- that directly tests this regulatory mechanism and substantially improves power relative to single variant tests and other gene-based tests. PrediXcan is inherently mechanistic and provides directionality, highlighting its potential utility in identifying novel targets for therapy. The method consists of predicting the whole genome effect on expression traits and correlating this effect with disease risk to identify novel disease genes. In addition, we propose novel approaches to investigate the context-specificity of expression traits (Orthogonal Tissue Decomposition) and to quantify the collective effect of the regulated transcriptome on phenotypes of interest (Regulability). Regulability is similar to the concept of chip heritability (total variability explained collectivey by genotyped variants). First, we will develop cross-tissue, tissue-specific (for over 30 different human tissue types), and brain-region specific expression traits. We will use statistical machine learning methods to develop whole genome prediction models for these traits and extend this work to other molecular phenotypes. All models will be stored in open access databases. Next, we will apply the PrediXcan method to 7 mental disorder phenotypes. More specifically, we will compute genetically predicted levels of gene expression traits and correlate them with disease risk to identify genes involved in disease pathways. We will also quantify the collective effect of the predicted transcriptome (regulability) on mental disorder risk across multiple tissues. Finally we will extend PrediXcan method and develop a method to infer the results of PrediXcan using summary statistics data as opposed to individual level data. This will extend the applicability of the approach to all summary results generated by meta-analysis consortia and increase the power to discover novel genes given the larger sample sizes. The research we propose is driven by an extensive set of preliminary studies, and promises substantial deliverables in both new methods of analysis and public access results databases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large investments in genome studies have been made to understand the consequences of genetic variation on human traits. These have yielded many genetic variants reproducibly associated with disease but the underlying biology is still unclear. We propose a novel computational method that links mechanistically the genetic variability to disease risk and apply it to a range of mental disorder studies to provide more biological insights and enable discovery of potential targets for drug development.","Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect",9130902,R01MH107666,"['senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Anorexia Nervosa ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biology ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exons ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' histocompatibility typing ', ' Tissue Typing ', ' Tissue Crossmatching ', ' Histocompatibility Testing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Investments ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Phenotype ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Source ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' trait ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' gene testing ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' Genomics ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Disease Pathway ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Heritability ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new drug target ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' database of Genotypes and Phenotypes ', ' dbGaP ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' transcriptome ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' GTEx ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2016,430578,0.09382691595736863
"EMERGE PHASE III CLINICAL CENTER AT PARTNERS HEALTHCARE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eMERGE III Clinical Center proposal from Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank, clinical data in the electronic medical records (EMR) for >4 million participants from the largest integrated health care provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise and state-of-the-art genetic analysis. We propose three aims. (1) Aim 1. Discovery. We will test the hypothesis that common and rare variants from a custom chip including 50,000 loss of function (LoF) alleles will be associated with cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric and immune-mediated phenotypes derived from the EMR. We are currently genotyping 25,000 Partners HealthCare Biobank subjects with a custom chip that includes LoF alleles from 63,000 exomes that we have analyzed. (2) Aim 2. Penetrance and Pleiotropy. We will test the hypothesis that sequencing a set of established genes or loci will allow us to discover additional variation, and define penetrance and pleiotropy using EMR phenotypes. Rare variants in genes selected by the eMERGE network will be studied for penetrance and pleiotropic outcomes by PheWAS and chart review. In addition, we are poised to perform recall-by-genotype studies because all Biobank participants have provided consent for such callback. (3) Aim 3. Implementation. We will test the hypothesis that physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based upon voluntary return of actionable variants to provide safe and cost-effective benefits to patients. We will screen our entire Biobank population of 25,000 individuals for pathogenic variants in the LDLR gene, the leading genetic cause of premature coronary artery disease, and conduct an exploratory trial in disclosing this information. Biobank participants with pathogenic variants in LDLR will be offered enrollment into a randomized trial, in which their finding will be CLIA-confirmed, and in one arm, this result will be communicated to their physicians through the EMR. Over one year, we will collect the following outcomes through participant surveys and EMR queries: physician visits, laboratory testing, changes in medication prescriptions, LDL levels, medical costs and the number of family members screened and treated as a result of the intervention. We will collaborate with the entire eMERGE III Network to incorporate what we learn from this pilot trial into large-scale implementation protocols for the genes selected by the Network for sequencing. Finally, we will participate in all Network activities to enhance the movement of genetics into clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The discovery and clinical use of genetic variants associated with both rare Mendelian and more common complex diseases promises to dramatically change the practice of medicine. Our eMERGE III project will leverage a large Biobank and a rich electronic medical record to define the phenotypic impact of mutations emerging from sequencing and then return results on selected variants to Biobank participants using a clinical trial.",EMERGE PHASE III CLINICAL CENTER AT PARTNERS HEALTHCARE,9284512,U01HG008685,"['Algorithms ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Atrophic

"Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION While accurate annotations of protein-coding regions in the human genome have been available for many years, annotation and interpretation of regulatory sequences has lagged far behind. This is because—in contrast to protein-coding sequences—the “rules” that govern links from genome sequence to regulatory function are fuzzy, complex, and highly context-specific. Our limited understanding of regulatory regions presents a fundamental challenge for the identification and interpretation of disease variation, especially in the context of personal genome interpretation. Work from ENCODE and other groups has started to close this gap through experimental work, including high-resolution maps of regulatory sites in a variety of cell types, and modeling of the cell-type specific mappings from genome sequence to regulatory function. In this project we will develop a suite of new tools that uses these diverse new data sets to tackle these problems. We will implement and apply powerful new machine learning methods (based on deep learning) to interpret the genomic, context-specific encoding of regulatory information, and to identify genetic variants that impact the encoded information. We will build models using data from a variety of sources including ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GTEx, regulatory variation in the HapMap cell lines, as well as from disease cohorts. Validation experiments will be performed using a new high-complexity CRISPR/Cas9 system developed by our team. We will develop software tools and analytical results that can be widely used for genome interpretation, especially in analysis of personal genomes. By the end of this study we expect to have: (1) developed powerful new computational models for predicting regulatory function in a wide variety of cell types, at unprecedented resolution; (2) implemented novel validation screens in native chromatin at extremely high throughput; and (3) developed new tools for interpreting common and rare regulatory variation, with particular focus on identification of high-impact regulatory mutations in personal genomes. We are committed to timely release of software, data and analysis and are committed to working with the ENCODE Consortium to increase the impact of data and analyses from all study sites. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this project is to develop powerful new computational methods to understand and predict the identity and function of gene regulatory sequences in diverse cell types. We will use these new methods to help us interpret common and rare genetic variation, and to identify variants that may contribute to disease. Outputs from the project will include new methods, software and functional validation data.","Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and

"Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recognized as an extremely common disorder that results in excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of automobile crashes. It is also an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiovascular events, increased cancer rates and cancer mortality, and accelerates the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. OSA is a systemic disorder and the cyclical intermittent hypoxia that occurs during sleep affects every organ system. OSA is heritable, with first degree relatives of individuals with OSA having a two-fold increased risk of the disorder. Although this has been known for over two decades, there are very limited data on gene variants conferring risk or protection for OSA. This is likely the result of underpowered studies and GENETIC HETEROGENEITY. There are multiple pathways to OSA. Obesity is a major risk factor, as are craniofacial dimensions. The relative risk of these different risk factors varies by ethnic group. There are also neuronal mechanisms and other physiological risk factors. This proposal seeks to directly address the issue of genetic heterogeneity using a very large sample of patients and state-of- the-art analysis techniques. Towards this end, we have assembled by far the largest sample of well characterized and genotyped patients with OSA. This is the result of collaboration with key sites in the eMERGE Network [Geisinger, Vanderbilt, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern], Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania. We propose to carry out a robust genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using an electronic health record (EHR) derived case definition and quantitative trait analysis of OSA severity. We will use novel machine learning approaches to specifically address genetic heterogeneity. The GWAS approach will be complimented by a PheWAS strategy as another approach to identifying common variants and related clinical phenotypes. Specifically, we will look for variants that associate with OSA and other clinical diagnoses in the EHR. It is likely that gene variants for OSA will have pleiotropic effects. Gene variants identified from GWAS and/or PheWAS will be further assessed. First, we will use available whole exome sequencing data to see if there are relevant rare variants in these genes, as well as to perform exploratory discovery analyses to look for novel rare variation. The functional role of the genes identified will be studied by functional network analysis. Finally, we will assess associations with quantitative data on intermediate traits identified by high throughput craniofacial and intra-oral photography. These data are currently available within the Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium (SAGIC). Future directions will assess the function of the genes identified in model systems and the clinical utility of utilizing variants as part of risk stratification for OSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with multiple adverse consequences. It is known that OSA has a genetic basis, but to date no convincing gene variants have been identified. This study uses state of the art approaches to identifying relevant genes based on a very large sample of patients with OSA obtained from multiple institutions in the United States. It is by far the largest study ever proposed for identifying genes for this common sleep disorder.",Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea,9331729,R01HL134015,"['Affect ', '

"Leveraging Tissue-Specific Regulatory Grammar to Interpret Human Evolution and Non-coding Variation Project Summary  It is now possible to readily identify sequence variants that have been subject to natural selection in human populations. Adaptive variants have been shown to underlie diversity in both disease risk and morphology across human populations, suggesting that the lens of evolution remains a powerful tool for understanding human biology, yet one that is currently underutilized. One challenge to realizing this potential is that over 99% of human genetic variation is non-coding, as are most signals of selection and variants associated with human phenotypic traits. Mutations modifying transcription factor (TF) binding sites in non- coding, cis-regulatory regions are hypothesized to be more amenable to driving phenotypic evolution than coding changes. These cis-regulatory regions are major determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and variation within enhancers has been indicated to play role in selection and disease. However, enhancer `regulatory grammar' – the complex pattern of sequences that interact with TFs to control gene expression, is poorly understood. The challenge of linking a regulatory variant under selection to an adaptive phenotype is similar to that facing disease association studies: the targeted gene, cell type, and biological process are often unknown, hindering further investigation.  Machine learning algorithms automate the discovery of patterns, making them well-suited to uncover sequence constraints and the combinatorial TF binding patterns of enhancers without relying on limited motif databases. I will optimize support vector machine classifiers to elucidate regulatory grammar from over 100 cell types and tissues. These models will be used to predict the impact of sequence variants on cis-regulatory sites, expanding the utility of the NHGRI's ENCODE and Roadmap projects. I will then apply these tissue- specific predictions to signals of selection and/or disease from the NHGRI's 1000 Genomes Project and its genome-wide association studies catalog. By describing the regulatory impact of signals of selection, I will globally describe patterns of functional adaptation across populations, identifying genes, and gene networks targeted by selection and/or disease. I will functionally characterize variants using massively parallel reporter assays and genome editing to give deeper insight into specific cases of evolution relevant for human health.    This project seeks to develop tools and resources to describe the structure and function of sequence variation in the human genome. This proposal seeks to vastly increase the number of elucidated cases of human evolution, and specifically characterize those adaptive variants associated with disease. We will share the functional regulatory predictions for the use in interpreting a broad range of genomic datasets. This work has broad implications, from interpreting genetic variants in populations and understanding functional targets of evolution, to prioritizing non-coding mutations for precision genomic medicine and beyond. Project Narrative While thousands of genomic regions have been linked to human evolution and diseases, many of the genetic variants responsible are non-coding and thus difficult to interpret. I propose to describe the tissue-specific effects of regulatory variants using machine learning algorithms, and then integrate these functional predictions with signals of selection and/or disease association in order to pinpoint genetic variants important for human evolution and health.",Leveraging Tissue-Specific Regulatory Grammar to Interpret Human Evolution and Non-coding Variation,9502066,F32HG009226,"['Algorithms ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Chromatin ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Evolution ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Logic ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' Enhancers ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Mediating ', ' Natural Selections ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' Human Biology ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' genome database ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Data ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression ', ' Differential Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Gene Expression ', ' trend ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' NHGRI ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' disease phenotype ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' combinatorial ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' epigenome ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' genome editing ', ' genomic editing ', ' functional adaptation ', ' precision genomic medicine ', ' genomic data ', ' web-based tool ', ' ']",NHGRI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F32,2017,2400,0.17322074226230802
"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.",Massively

"Regulation of mRNA splicing by intronic genetic variants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic variations in introns commonly impact cellular functions by causing alterations in mRNA splicing. The abnormal inclusion and exclusion of exons often change protein functions and cellular phenotypes. Although many intronic variations have known functions, with the adoption of next generation sequencing, many more intronic variants have been discovered for which the functional impact is unknown. Thus, it is important to be able to predict the impact of the variants without needing to test them all in expensive and laborious assays. Although there are informatics algorithms that predict the impact of genetic variants on pre-mRNA splicing, their ability to predict the effect on protein function and ultimately disease and therapeutic phenotypes is lacking. In addition, there is a need for high-throughput cellular assays to test the results of these predictions on cellular functions. The studies proposed here will fulfill these needs by developing algorithms that prioritize the intronic variants by their potential impact on splicing and gene function, and developing a high-throughput assay to functionally test thousands of these predictions. These novel technologies will be applied to the effect of intronic variants on the pharmacogenomics of two clinically important oncology drugs, clofarabine and paclitaxel. Our long-term goals are to be able to predict the functional impact of genomic variants on human disease and therapeutic response. Our central hypothesis is that intronic genetic variants alter mRNA splicing and consequently protein function that ultimately affects the cellular response to drug therapy. Our first aim will be to develop computational algorithms that prioritize intronic variants based on their impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Using a variety of genomic and structural features and large sets of genomic data, we will develop a bioinformatics algorithm specifically designed to prioritize intronic variants based on their potential impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Our second aim will be to identify functional intronic variants associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. Using existing genomics and cellular cytotoxic response data from populations of human cell lines, we will identify functional intronic variants that contribute to individuals' responses to clofarabine and paclitaxel cytotoxicity. Our third aim will be to functionally test the impact of the prioritized intronic variants on pre-mRNA splicing and drug cytotoxicity. Using our novel high- throughput functional splicing assay, we will test the effects of predicted functional variants from Aim 2 on pre- mRNA splicing. In addition, we will validate the effect of the intronic variants on cytotoxicity using exon specific siRNA and CRISPR/Cas technology to manipulate the target gene splicing. Upon completion of these studies, we expect to have developed bioinformatics algorithms that can accurately prioritize the intronic variants based on their functional impact on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Also, we will have tested thousands of variants in a cellular pre-mRNA splicing assay and validated the impact of several of these functional variants on paclitaxel and clofarabine cytotoxicity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative The goal of this project is to design and implement a set of bioinformatics algorithms and high-throughput experimental assays for prioritizing functional intronic variants that contribute to phenotypic differences by affecting pre-mRNA splicing. The developed model, including a molecular validation component, will be used to systematically evaluate the functions of such variants that are associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. The same strategy can also be used to study the etiology of complex diseases.

"Biomedical Computing and Informatics Strategies for Infectious Disease Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important goal of infectious disease research is to develop genetic predictors of susceptibility. Our success in this endeavor will depend critically on the informatics methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic and genomic data. The goal of this research program is to develop, evaluate, distribute and support new and novel biomedical computing algorithms and open-source software for identifying combinations of genetic predictors of clinically important infectious disease outcomes. This application will target the growing body of rare genetic variants identified by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our clinical application will focus on the prediction of antiretroviral response in clinical trials for HIV/AIDS. We propose here a highly innovative Hierarchical Rare Variant Collapsing Machine (HRVCM) algorithm for identifying and collapsing combinations of rare variants across gene regions (AIM 1). We will then integrate these new collapsed HRVCM variables into our popular Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method that will assess them in combination with common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genome-wide association studies or GWAS (AIM 2). Our novel HRVCM-MDR approach will, for the first time, make it possible to assess non-additive interactions among sets of rare and common variants simultaneously in genetic studies of infectious diseases. We will apply these new and novel methods to approximately 13 million rare and common variants from nearly 3000 subjects that participated in an AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) study to evaluate risk for virologic failure with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens (AIM 3). Finally, we will release all methods as open source to the biomedical research community through our freely available MDR software package (AIM 4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this application is to develop innovative new computational methods for the genetic analysis of infectious diseases.

"Integrative interpretation of the organismal consequences of non-coding variation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our capacity to sequence human genomes has exceeded our ability to interpret genetic variation, particularly in non-coding regions. To address this challenge, we recently developed a novel framework, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD), for estimating the deleteriousness of any genetic variant. CADD defines an objective, data-rich, and quantitative integration of many genomic annotations into a single measure of variant effect at the organismal level. The goals of this R01 proposal are to further develop the CADD framework, to apply it in the context of ongoing genetic studies of both rare and common human diseases, and to experimentally evaluate its predictions. In Specific Aim 1, we will substantially modify CADD in both straightforward and creative ways, with the goal of dramatically improving CADD's ability to annotate non- coding variants, not only to estimate their organismal effects but also to provide insights into molecular mechanisms. In Specific Aim 2, we will apply CADD to a variety of ongoing whole genome sequencing studies of human disease, especially those in which non-coding variants are either known or suspected to be causal. As part of this effort, we will develop new statistical frameworks that directly incorporat CADD into traditional genome-wide discovery approaches. In Specific Aim 3, we will perform a combination of high-throughput (massively parallel reporter assays), medium-throughput (CRISPR/Cas9), and low-throughput (in vivo mouse transgenics) experimental assays for systematic and targeted assessment of CADD predictions. This proposal includes both computational and experimental innovations, and builds on established collaborative relationships between investigators with complementary strengths. The completion of our aims will yield novel methods, data, and resources with which to annotate whole genome sequences, broadly enabling the field to more effectively identify and mechanistically understand non-coding genetic variants that are causally relevant to human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As we enter an era of personalized medicine, a deep understanding of human genomes will be increasingly important to public health, contributing to the unraveling of the genetic basis of human disease, as well as serving an increasing role in clinical diagnostics. However, our limited understanding of the functional consequences of most genetic variants, especially those that do not alter protein sequence, represents a major obstacle. This proposal seeks to dramatically improve our ability to identify and interpret ""non-coding"" variants that causally contribute to human disease. A recently developed computational approach will be substantially improved and evaluated in a variety of genetic studies, and its predictions will be experimentally validated.

"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the 'early' detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to is development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to fine- map already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this two- stage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 ""convenience controls"" from the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the 'early' subclinical phenotypes identified through the use o VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1. Lastly, for the second part of Aim 3, we will investigate the potential function of KC variants by testing their ability to influence gene structure, expression and function in corneal cell models, including iPS cells derived from corneal keratocytes developed by our research team. The results of these studies will help advance our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to KC and may result in novel treatment options to slow the progression of the disease.

"IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset PROJECT SUMMARY Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 200 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, meeting recruitment objectives and taking roles in IBDGC leadership positions. Our particular focus is on African American (AA) IBD genetics. We performed the first large-scale evaluation of European loci in the AA population, replicating several genes, but also finding unique African-ancestral variants within these loci, as well as identified multiple admixture significant loci. We also published the first AA IBD genome-wide association study (GWAS), a collaborative effort that identified two African-specific gene loci, and replicated multiple additional European loci. We have also explored why some loci with proven risk variants in Europeans and other populations only cause disease in one ancestral population but not others. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population. In this application we will re-evaluate the AA GWAS by better imputation, evaluate whole genome sequencing data to test low frequency and rare variants, and perform an evaluation for chromosome X variants. We will recruit a large number of AA IBD patients through our own and multiple Satellite Recruitment Centers to power a second AA IBD GWAS, both UC and CD, and meta-analyze with the first to identify more novel loci, identify more African specific risk variants, and replicate known loci for this population and replicate our admixture loci. We will also incorporate diverse data sources to incorporate into our GWAS analyses including RNA-Seq currently being generated on lymophoblastoid cell lines from AA CD cases and controls, and RNA-Seq that we will generate in colonic biopsies from UC cases and controls. We will evaluate chromatin differences and expression of genes in cell types relevant to IBD from European, AA and East Asian ancestries in an effort to better understand locus heterogeneity by ancestry. We will continue to participate in all IBDGC activities to maximize the Impact of IBD genetics research by this cooperative funding mechanism. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.4 million Americans suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic debilitating disorder with no cure that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD ranks in the top 5 in prevalence for gastrointestinal disorders and represents a significant financial burden to society requiring a lifetime of medical care. This proposed research aims to determine the genetic variations that cause IBD which will aid in developing preventive measures, improving the quality of care with better treatments and educating

"Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements Understanding of regulatory elements in the human genome is a key step in our ability to understand complex biological and disease systems. Regulatory elements are much more difficult to identify than genes and likely account for more variation among individuals than actual coding differences in genes. Identifying and studying elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, will lead to new therapeutic strategies as the complex regulatory networks are revealed. Up to now the characterization and validation of truly functional regulatory elements has been a low throughput endeavor as each regulatory site is cloned into a reporter assay and tested. This proposal produces a novel method that performs one of the most common validation assays, transient transfections, in a high-throughput manner by combining it with an innovative sorting and sequencing system. This system, which has been shown to be practical and feasible, will allow for rapid and thorough identification of the method of action of regulatory elements throughout the human genome.  The candidate's background in both computer science and molecular biology ranging from undergraduate to graduate school and post-doctoral work provides a complete background that should allow for implementation and extension of the described experiment in the post-doctoral environment. The nature of the science and the data produced should allow continuation and extension of the work as a new faculty member. Stanford and the Snyder lab provide an outstanding environment for a strong program allowing development of the candidate and preparation for transition to a long-term independent research career. As part of this program, the candidate will combine a mentoring committee with continuing education via available online courses.  The end result of both phases of the program will be scientific results that can be extended into useful and important medically and scientifically relevant areas as they relate to regulation of expression in humans. The innovative methods described will allow the candidate to pursue various lines of endeavor well past the end of this funding program. In turn the candidate will be positioned at the end of the program to function as an independent principle investigator and valuable collaborator. This project seeks to extend current assays demonstrating function of genomic regions into an equivalent genome-wide assay. Identification of the effect of these regions on gene expression will lead to a better understanding of the complex regulatory `code' dictating our cellular processes. In turn, this improved understanding will bring forth new potential targets to approach incorrect regulation leading to disease.",Global Discovery and Validation of Functional Regulatory Elements,9478475,R00HG007356,"['Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Continuance of education ', ' Continuing Education ', ' Elements ', ' Enhancer Elements ', ' Genetic Enhancer Element ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Libraries ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Proteins ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Transactivators ', ' Trans-Acting Factors ', ' Trans-Activators ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transfection ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Enhancers ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' computer science ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Regulation ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' ChIP assay ', ' LIF gene ', ' leukemia inhibitory factor ', ' leukemia inhibitor factor ', ' LIF ', ' D-Factor ', ' Cholinergic Differentiation Factor ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' combinatorial ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' online course ', ' online curriculum ', ' E-course ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R00,2017,50000,0.07617434221950645
"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,9247640,UM1HG009435,"['Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' auto-immune disorder ', ' auto-immune disease ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' type I diabetes ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1DM ', ' T1D ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1 DM ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dissection ', ' Elements ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Logic ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE - Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' SLE ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Amino Acid Substitution ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' trait ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Computational Technique ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' K562 blasts ', ' K562 ', ' K-562 ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Lupus ', ' human disease ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' biological systems ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' HepG2 ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' Hep G2 ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR interference ', ' CRISPRi ', ' CRISPR screen ', ' clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats screen ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 screen ', ' CRISPR-based screen ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2017,654000,0.16975207237621465
"An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease result from platelet thrombus formation at the site of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. Numerous studies have shown enhanced platelet reactivity, and increased platelet count and volume are risk factors for CHD events and fatality, and a recent NHLBI Working Group concluded that variation in platelet reactivity is a major determinant of ischemic events, like MI or stroke. Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous common genetic variants associated with the risk of CHD and platelet function parameters, but most of the positive ""hits"" are not causative of the phenotype. To understand the cellular mechanisms by which these variants affect platelet function it is imperative to know the repertoire of mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs expressed in the cell of interest. Our team has been a leader in the field of platelet transcriptomics as well as functional assessment of variants in platelet genes. We have profiled mRNAs and miRNAs from 183 subjects using multiple platforms and have also performed platelet RNA-seq on 14 different subjects. This information provides a critical ability to filter, prioritize and obtain variant functional insights for evaluating GWAS SNPs associated with MI, stroke and platelet parameters. We have identified 142 mRNAs and 9 miRNAs that are expressed in platelets and linked to these GWAS hits. The goals of this proposal are to identify, assay, and validate functional variation previously tagged in GWASs of platelet-mediated ischemic arterial disease and of platelet phenotypes. Aim 1 will identify GWAS-linked mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs that are functional in platelets. Candidate RNAs will be refined by association with platelet function, eQTLs and QTLs using our previously generated platelet RNA data. We will develop a supervised machine-learning, statistical pattern matching algorithm to prioritize likely platelet-functional genes. Gene-level assays in which we knock down mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA in our human megakaryocyte culture system, followed by assays for integrin activation and quantification of platelet number and volume will be used to confirm platelet functionality. Aim 2 will identify functionally divergent SNPs and haplotypes. We will impute missing SNPs and perform fine-mapping to the phenotypes of interest. Variants will be prioritized by association strength, annotation data, and predicted function using publically available resources and our own platelet eQTL data. Non-coding candidates will be tested by reporter gene assay and non-synonymous variants will be tested using functional assays in cell lines in which the endogenous gene has been silenced. We will validate our findings with a replication analysis in which we use an independent cohort dataset to quantify the association of the tested variants with the original GWAS phenotype. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Platelet-mediated arterial thrombosis in the coronary or cerebrovascular circulation is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in the U.S. Numerous DNA variations have been associated with these disorders, but the causal genes are unknown. This research will test whether genes near these DNA variations - and candidate variations themselves - alter platelet function or number to understand better the molecular mechanisms causing heart attacks and strokes.",An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke,9276780,R01HL128234,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' thrombocyte/platelet ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Platelets Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', "" Hayem's elementary corpuscle "", "" Deetjeen's body "", "" Bizzozero's corpuscle/cell "", ' Blood Platelets ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' brain blood flow ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' intracranial vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebrovascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' brain vascular dysfunction ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Coronary Circulation ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' vulnerable plaque ', ' atherosclerotic plaque ', ' atherosclerotic lesions ', ' atherosclerosis plaque ', ' Atheromatous plaque ', ' Atheromatous degeneration ', ' Atheromatous ', ' Atheroma ', ' Arterial Fatty Streaks ', ' Arterial Fatty Streak ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Integrins ', ' Integrins Extracellular Matrix ', ' Introns ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' Megakaryocytes ', ' Megalokaryocyte ', ' Blood megakaryocyte ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

In order to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health, novel computational analyses are needed. To address this challenge, we will develop new methods for epigenomic analysis, building on our extensive experience interpreting epigenomic information, and our preliminary studies building chromatin states, activity clusters, and regulatory motif maps for the Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE datasets. In Aim 1, we will characterize epigenomic differences and changes during lineage differentiation by developing new tools for systematic comparison of groups of epigenomes that directly exploit the complexity of epigenomic datasets; we will also develop methods for clustering epigenomes into developmental lineages based on automatically-learned diverse epigenomic features that distinguish them; and methods that learn the unidirectional epigenomic changes that pluripotent cells undergo during lineage commitment to gain more insights into differentiation and automatically learn to classify lineages and differentiation trajectories. In Am 2, we will seek to characterize higher-order chromatin architecture and chromatin conformation to enable systematic interpretation of cis-regulatory modules: we will develop a novel statistical approach for enhancer-enhancer and enhancer-gene linking to reveal interacting regions and their target genes based on their coordinated activity patterns across cell and tissue types; we will train a supervised learning method for predicting both constitutive and tissue-specific chromatin conformation information based on chromatin state information, individual chromatin marks, genomic distance, activity, regulatory motif information, and DNA sequence; and we will use these higher-order interaction maps to predict gene expression levels based on the combined action of multiple regulatory regions and to define the cis-regulatory architecture of each gene in the human genome. The resulting resources will be invaluable for studies of gene regulation, by revealing the set of regulatory elements that are linked to each gene, and for the interpretation of genetic studies, by revealing the set of regulatory elements which jointly act to regulate each target gene and the potential target genes of non-coding variants associated with human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have generated a collection of 4000+ epigenomics datasets across 200+ cell and tissue types, which can be invaluable to the scientific community, but novel computational analyses are needed to maximize its impact on gene regulation, cellular differentiation, and human health. To address this need, we propose to systematically study epigenomic differences between cell types, lineages, and stages of differentiation, and to learn models predicting the higher-order chromatin structures across cell/tissue types, within each cell/tissue, and the chromatin architectures that they define. By systematically interpreting epigenomic annotations in the context of their cellular differentiation and their higher-order chromatin structures, the resultin resource will greatly increase their impact on human health by enabling disease studies to understand the mechanistic relationship between non-coding variants and their target genes, and the specific differentiation stages in which they act.",Comparative analysis and regulatory architecture of epigenomics datasets,9253408,R01GM113708,"['Algorithms ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' Correlation Studies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Supervision ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Enhancers ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' experience ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' ward ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Structure ', ' Higher Order Structure ', ' Higher Order Chromatin Folding ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Collection ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' comparison group ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' human disease ', ' comparative ', ' public health relevance ', ' epigenome ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' Genetic study ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,284959,0.08421345851064095
"Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genetic code not only determines protein amino acid residue sequence but also defines the 'splicing code' of cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements that control pre-mRNA splicing. Single nucleotide variant (SNV) changes at key regions in pre-mRNA may disrupt splicing resulting in disease [1, 2]. Understanding which SNVs cause aberrant splicing and which are benign is important for understanding disease pathogenesis. SNVs at consensus splice sites, at exon-intron junctions, are known to cause aberrant splicing and contribute to at least 10% of inherited diseases [2]. However, SNVs outside consensus splice sites can still disrupt splicing [3]. Current, bioinformatics tools limit analysis to SNVs at or near consensus splice sites and lack the ability to generalize to SNVs beyond the consensus splice site [4-7]. In this application, I propose to substantially improve the ability to interpret the consequences of mutations on pre-mRNA splicing. This goal will be achieved by: 1) developing novel features, useful in predicting the impact of variation on cis- splicing regulation; 2) training a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses the novel features to predict the impact of SNVs; 3) sharing the algorithm in a publically available software package; and 4) comparing algorithm predictions to the relationships between SNVs and splicing patterns derived from matched DNA- and RNA-sequencing studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic sequences not only encode the amino acids of proteins but also regulate many critical biological functions, including pre-mRNA splicing.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss

"F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient-to-patient variability in response to drugs creates a significant challenge for the safe and effective treatment of many human diseases. Pharmacogenomics seeks to address this challenge by linking drug response to patient genotypes at important loci, termed pharmacogenes, in order to better customize patient treatments. Genetic variation in pharmacogenes is extensive. For example, amongst 12 CYP genes, 10% of people carry at least one rare, potentially deleterious variant. Unfortunately, only a small number of variants have been unambiguously linked to alterations in drug response. Clearly, new approaches are needed to annotate the consequences of the huge pool of variants of unknown significance, including those already identified by existing large-scale sequencing programs, and those that will be discovered as clinical sequencing becomes routine. In this proposal, we seek to address this problem directly and at a scale never before possible by taking advantage of new technologies in sequencing and functional analysis. Our resource, termed F-CAP (Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes) will test all possible substitutions at all amino acid residues in some of the most clinically important pharmacogenes and disseminate these data to the medical and research communities. In order to accomplish this, we will use deep mutational scanning, a method we have developed that allows parallelized, and quantitative measurements to be performed on libraries of genetic variants. In Aim 1 we will create these libraries, starting with five of the most important CPIC level A or B priority genes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, TPMT and VKORC1), and test the stability and enzymatic activity of each variant en masse using a pooled selection strategy. In Aim 2, we will integrate these data to create an impact score. This impact score provides a numerical value for a variant's functional effects that is amenable to easy integration into prescribing guidelines being developed by the pharmacogenomics community. Aim 3 will validate this score for a subset of variants that span the impact score spectrum using therapeutically relevant substrates for each pharmacogene. Finally, Aim 4 describes a key component of this resource: the dissemination of our findings to the entire pharmacogenomics community through partnership with CPIC and PharmGKB. In addition, we will make available our raw and processed data via a custom web resource that will also be developed in Aim 4. This resource will provide a series of fully annotated datasets describing the functional consequences of every possible single mutation in a series of key pharmacogenes, thereby greatly advancing the field of personalized medicine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pharmacogenomics seeks to identify genetic sources of inter-individual variability in drug response, with the goal of personalizing drug selection and dose to improve patient outcomes. A key barrier to using pharmacogenomic information is lack of clarity about the functional impact of variants, which hampers the provision of clear, unambiguous guidance to health care providers. We propose to connect pharmacogenomic variant discovery with novel high-throughput experimental approaches to deliver a resource to guide the use of individual pharmacogenomic information in personalizing drug treatment.",F-CAP: Functionalization of Variants in Clinically Actionable Pharmacogenes,9302807,R24GM115277,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' aminoacid ', ' Amino Acids ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' genetic library ', ' Gene Library ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' In Vitro ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Patients ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Medical Research ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' interest ', ' genetic disorder diagnosis ', ' genetic diagnosis ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' response ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', ' CYP2C19 gene ', ' P450C2C ', ' Mephenytoin 4-Prime Hydroxylase ', ' Cytochrome P450, Subfamily IIC, Polypeptide 19 ', ' CYP2C19 ', ' CYP2C ', ' CYP2C9 gene ', ' Cytochrome P450, Subfamily IIC, Polypeptide 9 ', ' CYP2C9 ', ' CYP2D6 gene ', ' Subfamily IID-Like 1 Cytochrome P450 ', ' Subfamily IID Cytochrome P450 ', ' Sparteine Monooxygenase ', ' P450DB1 ', ' P450C2D ', ' P450-DB1 ', ' P450-2D6 ', ' Imipramine 2-Hydroxylase ', ' Debrisoquine Hydroxylase ', ' Debrisoquine 4-Monooxygenase ', ' Debrisoquine 4-Hydroxylase ', ' Cytochrome P450 Subfamily IID Polypeptide 6 ', ' Cytochrome P450 2D6 ', ' Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 ', ' CYPIID6 ', ' CYP2DL1 ', ' CYP2D6 ', ' CYP2D ', ' CYP 2D6 ', ' CPD6 ', ' TPMT gene ', ' TPMT ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Mutate ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' Large-Scale Sequencing ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Numerical value ', ' Output ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' user-friendly ', ' human disease ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' stability testing ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' High-Throughput DNA Sequencing ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' genetic information ', ' variant of unknown significance ', ' variant of undetermined significance ', ' variant of uncertain significance ', ' variant of uncertain clinical significance ', ' unclassified variant ', ' clinical sequencing ', ' clinically actionable ', ' genotyped patients ', ' mutation screening ', ' mutation scanning ', ' online resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' web resource ', ' on-line resource ', ' internet resource ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R24,2017,737011,0.1689453685449453
"Inferring the effects of genetic variants on gene expression and splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to facilitate the interpretation of genetic variants identified in clinical whole- genome and whole-exome sequencing studies through the development of computational methods to predict functional effects of individual variants. Genome-scale sequencing technologies are increasingly enabling studies of genetic variation in large numbers of individuals; however, interpreting the clinical significance of the hundreds of thousands of genetic variants identified in these studies remains a critical challenge. Gene expression regulation is one mechanism by which variants can result in disease or other clinically-significant phenotypes. This mechanism is likely to be particularly important for disease-causing variants that do not directly affect protein structure by altering an amino acid sequence. The methods developed here will enable researchers to predict whether genetic variants are likely to have a regulatory effect on gene expression. The first stage of the project is to build computational models to predict such regulatory effects using a random forest machine learning approach. These models will be trained to recognize regulatory variation using a set of variants that have been shown to be involved in expression regulation in a recent study of gene expression across hundreds of individuals. Separate algorithms will be developed to predict two different types of regulatory effects: changes in the total amount of RNA produced from a particular gene (expression level variation) and changes in the specific form of RNA produced from a particular gene (splicing or isoform ratio variation). The second stage of the project is to evaluate the performance of these models on gene expression datasets from a separate human population and from different tissues within the human body, to explore their generalizability and to determine to what extent the characteristics of regulatory variants are conserved across tissues and populations. The final stage of the project is to use genetic variants in publicly-available databases that are known to be pathogenic to characterize how well these models perform at predicting clinical significance. This stage will test the hypothesis that variants that regulate gene expression are more likely to be clinically significant than variants that do not regulate expression. This project will impact public health by providing useful tools to improve prediction of the clinical significance of genetic variants identified in genome- scale sequencing studies. In addition, the project will provide biological insight into the tissue-specificity and population-specificity of genomic features that characterize regulatory genetic variants. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genome-scale sequencing technologies are increasingly enabling studies of genetic variation in large numbers of patients and other individuals.

"Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Over the past 10 years human genetics studies made unprecedented numbers of discoveries relating genome variation to common diseases. While it is unquestionably true that we have learned substantially from the discoveries made to date, we must also acknowledge that with respect to the identification and characterization of the genome variation affecting risk of common human diseases - those accounting for the overwhelming majority of public health care expenditures - our discoveries have not generated nearly the knowledge of disease etiology that we would have expected given the sheer number of these discoveries. The combination of these observations coupled with the dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing is driving the case for moving to whole genome sequencing studies for common disease. We have focused our application on three critical challenges for methods development and analysis of whole genome sequence data. While there has been substantial progress in methods development for analysis of exome sequencing, with gene-based tests that are relatively robust to the direction of effects of rare coding variants as well as the proportionof the gene's rare variants contributing to phenotype, it is clear that methods integrating the analysis of common and rare variation as well as functional genomics data will be essential for appropriate analysis of whole genome sequence data. Thus, we propose in Specific Aim 1 to develop novel methods, software and analysis pipelines for integrated analysis of common and rare variants for the analysis of whole genome sequence on 50,000- 100,000 individuals for any given common disease, and in Specific Aim 2 to develop and apply novel approaches for prioritizing results from these large-scale sequencing studies using BioVU, the 200,000 member biobank at Vanderbilt that is associated with 30 years of high quality electronic health records, and in Specific Aim 3 to develop queriable results databases and a comprehensive web portal to serve results of our studies on the sequence data for both the internal sequencing community and for the broader scientific community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies are being carried out to understand the genetic architecture of human complex diseases. It remains challenging to decipher the genetic mechanisms of disease etiology. In this application we aim to develop a suite of statistical and computational methods to identify genes and variants associated with complex disease and use BioVU, a DNA BioBank linked to electronic health records, to validate and investigate genetic architecture of multiple complex diseases.","Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases",9275537,U01HG009086,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Communities ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Government ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Generations ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' pleiotropism ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' success ', ' expectation ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' gene testing ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' functional genomics ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Data ', ' Large-Scale Sequencing ', ' Validation ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' NHGRI ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' disease phenotype ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' cost ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Coupled ', ' human disease ', ' public health relevance ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' exome sequencing ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' Genetic study ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' human genomics ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' genomic data ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,1213575,0.08926021278842002
"Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although investments in genomic studies of mental disorders enabled the discovery of thousands of robustly associated variants with these complex diseases, the translation of these discoveries into actionable targets has been hampered by the lack of a mechanistic understanding on how genome variation relates to phenotype. Moreover, it has been widely shown that a substantial portion of the genetic control of complex traits, including mental disorders, is exerted through the regulation of gene expression. However, effective methods to fully harness this mechanism are lagging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel gene-based test -PrediXcan- that directly tests this regulatory mechanism and substantially improves power relative to single variant tests and other gene-based tests. PrediXcan is inherently mechanistic and provides directionality, highlighting its potential utility in identifying novel targets for therapy. The method consists of predicting the whole genome effect on expression traits and correlating this effect with disease risk to identify novel disease genes. In addition, we propose novel approaches to investigate the context-specificity of expression traits (Orthogonal Tissue Decomposition) and to quantify the collective effect of the regulated transcriptome on phenotypes of interest (Regulability). Regulability is similar to the concept of chip heritability (total variability explained collectivey by genotyped variants). First, we will develop cross-tissue, tissue-specific (for over 30 different human tissue types), and brain-region specific expression traits. We will use statistical machine learning methods to develop whole genome prediction models for these traits and extend this work to other molecular phenotypes. All models will be stored in open access databases. Next, we will apply the PrediXcan method to 7 mental disorder phenotypes. More specifically, we will compute genetically predicted levels of gene expression traits and correlate them with disease risk to identify genes involved in disease pathways. We will also quantify the collective effect of the predicted transcriptome (regulability) on mental disorder risk across multiple tissues. Finally we will extend PrediXcan method and develop a method to infer the results of PrediXcan using summary statistics data as opposed to individual level data. This will extend the applicability of the approach to all summary results generated by meta-analysis consortia and increase the power to discover novel genes given the larger sample sizes. The research we propose is driven by an extensive set of preliminary studies, and promises substantial deliverables in both new methods of analysis and public access results databases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large investments in genome studies have been made to understand the consequences of genetic variation on human traits. These have yielded many genetic variants reproducibly associated with disease but the underlying biology is still unclear. We propose a novel computational method that links mechanistically the genetic variability to disease risk and apply it to a range of mental disorder studies to provide more biological insights and enable discovery of potential targets for drug development.","Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect",9301667,R01MH107666,"['senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Anorexia Nervosa ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Biology ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exons ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Investments ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ', ' Obsessive-Compulsive Neurosis ', ' Phenotype ', ' Quality Control ', ' Research ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translations ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Source ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' user friendly software ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' trait ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' gene testing ', ' novel ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' Genomics ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Brain region ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Disease Pathway ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Heritability ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' public health relevance ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' database of Genotypes and Phenotypes ', ' dbGaP ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' transcriptome ', ' phenotypic data ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' GTEx ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2017,430578,0.09382691595736863
"High-throughput methods for elucidating the control of chromatin accessibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will develop the first validated predictive model of how transcription factors dynamically determine genome-wide chromatin accessibility that is generalizable across biological systems.

As part of this aim we will identify transcription factor binding motifs tha are in the discovered regulatory vocabulary. We will validate and refine the causality of these models by testing whether they accurately predict the chromatin accessibility of thousands of synthetic DNA ""phrases"" that have been engineered into specific genomic locations and measured in the context of transcription factor gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies.

This observation coupled with the earlier age of onset in familial cancer syndromes suggests that germline variants contribute to the development of many pediatric cancers. Many known pathogenic germline variants exhibit biological features such as loss of heterozygosity and rarity within the general population; certain germline cancer-causing variants also cause cancer when acquired somatically. Identifying pathogenic germline variants from whole exome sequence (WES) data would clarify the pathogenesis of pediatric cancers, and might support improved treatments for cancer subtypes with poor prognosis such as relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), high-grade glioma (glioma), and ependymoma. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the role of germline variants in pediatric cancer development using genomic data. The objective of this application is to develop a computational biology tool that identifies pathogenic germline variants from WES data, and to apply this tool to analyze germline variants in relapse ALL, glioma, and ependymoma. This application's central hypothesis is that pathogenic germline variants have biological and cohort-specific features that distinguish them from benign variants, such that a machine learning pipeline trained on these features can predict pathogenic germline variants. Aim 1 will call germline variants in WES data from 1) pediatric patients with known cancer-causing germline variants and 2) control patients without cancer; patients in data set 1) are randomly divided into a training and test set. A bioinformatics pipeline will call variants, add annotation, and filter out low quality variants. Aim 2 will use the training set to train and optimize a machine-learning algorithm to predict high confidence germline driver variants. Aim 3 will apply the final pipeline to validation sets of pediatric relapsed ALL, glioma, and ependymoma samples. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that predicts pathogenicity of germline variants using a pediatric cancer cohort, enabling improved understanding of the contribution of germline variants to multiple pediatric cancers. Project Narrative Improved understanding how certain germline DNA variants (those DNA changes that are inherited or occur early in development) promote cancer might lead to better treatments for pediatric cancers. However, identifying which germline variants cause cancer is challenging without genetic information from family members. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational tool that learns from germline variants known to cause cancer and then predicts cancer-causing variants from pediatric cancer patient DNA sequences in the absence of family information; these predicted variants will undergo computational and experimental testing, and may clarify how pediatric cancers like relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, glioma, and ependymoma develop.",Discovery of pathogenic germline variants in pediatric cancers using genomics.,9313620,F31CA210607,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Control Groups ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' WHO Grade II Ependymal Tumor ', ' WHO Grade II Ependymal Neoplasm ', ' Ependymoma ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Glioma ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' acute lymphomatic leukemia ', ' acute lymphogenous leukemia ', ' acute lymphatic leukemia ', ' Precursor Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphoid Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' ALL -

"Predicting causal non-coding variants in a founder population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In order to characterize the molecular and cellular causes of human disease, it will be essential to unravel the functional impact of genetic variation. However, we are currently unable to predict the impact of the majority genetic variants that lie in non-coding regions of the genome, where indeed most complex disease-associated variants are found. Additionally, recent evidence suggests that a significant fraction of the non-coding genome is likely to be functional, often playing a role in gene regulation. Therefore, our limited understanding of non- coding variation is a critical hurdle to characterizing the genetic basis of disease. The goal of this project is to develop methods for interpreting non-coding genetic variation: to provide a robust and extensible Bayesian method for predicting causal variants from full genomes, to identify and validate a large set of functional non- coding variants using CRISPR technology, and to predict disease-relevant traits likely to be affected by each variant. Our project will leverage a unique cohort from a founder population in Sardinia, with genome sequence and/or transcriptome data available from 3000 individuals, along with extensive phenotyping for hundreds of traits. We will combine advanced statistical modeling with experimental validation based on genome engineering to identify causal non-coding variants affecting biomedical traits in the cohort, along with predicting functional mechanisms through which these variants ultimately perturb the cell. In Aim 1, we develop computational methods for predicting causal non-coding variation from full genomes, incorporating informative genomic features including epigenetic data, sequence motifs, and conservation information into a Bayesian approach jointly modeling multiple transcriptomic signals. We will optimize and apply these methods on genome and transcriptome data available for the Sardinia cohort to identify a large set of variants predicted to causally affect gene expression. Based on these predictions, in Aim 2, we connect putative causal variants with the diverse set of disease-relevant traits measured in the cohort, using network inference to capture the cascade from genetic variation to gene expression to disease. We will develop methods to integrate across variants, using the models in Aim 1, to identify the common causal mechanisms related to each trait. In Aim 3, we validate the causal impact of non-coding variants predicted to affect high-level traits. We will us genome editing through CRISPR to introduce individual genetic variants into cell lines and use qPCR to validate the predicted effects on gene expression. Finally, a major goal throughout this proposal will be to provide the research community with convenient computational tools for the prediction of causal non-coding variants from individual genomes, updated on an ongoing basis to integrate the most recent genomic annotations and public data in order to provide the best possible accuracy in predicting causal variants and the traits they are likely to affect. Our projet will greatly advance our understanding of non-coding genetic variation, the specific mechanisms affected by causal variants, and the downstream consequences to the cell and individual health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Understanding the impact of variation in the entire genome, beyond the well-studied protein-coding regions, is essential to understanding the relationship between genetics and human health. This proposal addresses the problem of identifying functional non-coding genetic variants and predicting the impact of each variant on hundreds of disease-relevant traits.

"Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences The proportion of the human genome that underlies gene regulation dwarfs the proportion that encodes proteins. However, we remain poorly equipped for identifying which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to risk for both rare and common human diseases. Understanding how non-coding sequences regulate gene expression, as well as being able to predict the functional consequences of genetic variation for gene regulation, are paramount challenges for the field. Here, we propose to combine synthetic biology, massively parallel functional assays, and machine learning to profoundly advance our understanding of the `regulatory code' of the human genome. While challenging, the task of unravelling complex codes from large amounts of empirical data is not without precedent. For example, over the past decade, computer scientists working in natural language processing have made immense progress, driven in large part by a combination of algorithmic and computational improvements and enormously larger training datasets than were available to the previous generations of scientists working in this area. Inspired by the revolutionizing impact of “big data” for traditional problems in machine learning, we propose to model gene regulatory phenomena using training datasets with several orders of magnitude more examples than naturally exist in the human genome. We predict that the models learned from massive numbers of synthetic examples will strongly outperform models learned from the small number of natural examples. We will demonstrate our approach by developing comprehensive, quantitative, and predictive models for alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, two widespread regulatory mechanisms by which a single gene can code for multiple transcripts and proteins. However, we anticipate that this basic paradigm – specifically, the massively parallel measurement of the functional behavior of extremely large numbers of synthetic sequences followed by quantitative modeling of sequence-function relationships – can be generalized to advance our understanding of diverse forms of gene regulation. This research seeks to develop predictive models of alternative splicing and polyadenylation by learning from millions of synthetic constructs, orders of magnitude more than the number of endogenous examples. These models will be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease.",Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences,9306648,R01HG009136,"['Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Isoforms ', ' synthetic construct ', ' synthetic DNA ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Polyadenylation ', ' RNA Polyadenylation ', ' Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' data modeling ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' synthetic biology ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' human disease ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' exon skipping ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR method ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Behavior ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Phenomena ', ' Biological Phenomena ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Computers ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,596615,0.0807789455599627
"""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation to predict Innate Immune Responses DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The expression of genes involves a sequence of enzymatic events, such as transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA decay, and translation, that are subject to gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of protein-nucleic acid interactions. It is well appreciated that the control of transcription via regulatory networks that regulate enhancer and promoter activities are not the sole determinant of what gene products result, but that exon skipping is pervasive and post-transcriptional mechanisms such as mRNA splicing and decay determine the kinetics of mRNA induction and abundance. Indeed, in our preliminary studies of the macrophage response to pathogens, we find that a majority of induced gene expression events result in mRNAs that deviate substantially from those predicted by the genome-browser, and that mRNA decay is controlled by both protein- nucleic acid and miRNA regulatory networks. The proposed Center for the ""Ribonomics"" of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop a predictive model for which mRNA isoforms are expressed and at what level given a given promoter activity and transcription initiation rate. We will develop generally applicable tools in conjunction with or in depth and quantitative experimental analysis of the macrophage response to pathogen-associated endotoxin, which results in the dramatic up regulation of more than 1000 genes. Strikingly, our preliminary data identified more than 900 exon skipping events in addition to numerous cases of alternative 5' or 3' splice site use, emphasizing the essential contribution of post-initiation events. Further, these splice patterns are dependent on the macrophage subtype-specific chromatin landscape and are altered by inducible splice factors in primed or tolerated states. Thus we will leverage the well-described macrophage biology and associated experimental model systems, to examine the role of gene structure and sequence (Aim 1), the role of chromatin modifications (Aim 2), and of trans-acting splicing factors (Aim 3) in determining the identity of mature mRNAs and their associated synthesis rates, before adding the stimulus-responsive regulatory networks that confer mRNA half-life control and thus determine the abundance of each mRNA isoform (Aim 4).

To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management.

"Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families Project Summary: Although affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees have substantially elevated recurrence risk compared to singleton cases, the mean polygenic risk scores between these groups do not differ, suggesting that one source of this higher familial recurrence risk is rare, higher impact variation. We will collect whole genome sequence (WGS) from 600 affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees to identify rare variation shared by affected individuals within and between pedigrees potentially accounting for the increased recurrence risk, and reducing the `variant space' under consideration. After QC and calling in our existing pipeline, a) familial sequence variants in the exome will be directly analyzed in 2000 Irish cases and 2000 Irish controls with 30X exome sequence data in production currently, and b) variants outside the exome will be imputed into 3600 Irish singleton schizophrenia or bipolar disorder cases and 3000 Irish population controls with GWAS framework data; 3781 additional UK10K controls with 10X WGS are available to increase analysis power. This imputed dataset will be analyzed using recently developed methods for kernel-based tests of variation aggregated over a defined interval (such as a gene) that avoid the inflation of type-1 error. We use multiple sources of genomic information to develop weights for each position in the genome (indexing the prior probability that a change at the site has functional consequence) and each variant detected (indexing the probability that observed changes have functional consequence), and we propose to improve the existing genomic information sources for this weighting in a number of ways. In aim 3, prioritized variants from aim 2a/2b will be directly genotyped in the case/control samples by custom microarray; individual genes or genesets showing enrichment of variation in cases (if any are observed) will be resequenced in the case/control sample. In Aim 4, the directly assessed genotypic and sequence data from aim 3 will be analyzed using standard methods to identify individual associated variants, and variant-enriched genes, genesets or other functional sequences. We seek to unambiguously identify 1) individual variants that are significantly more common in cases, or 2) individual genes or other functional sequences or 3) gene- or functional sequence sets enriched for variation in cases to provide critical information about the brain systems perturbed in schizophrenia, and the mechanisms by which such alleles increase risk. Project Narrative Rare sequence variation has been implicated in many human complex traits, incuding schizophrenia, and has been studied in unrelated cases and controls and parent:offspring trios, but remains unstudied in multiplex families. Sequencing the genomes of such families will allow conprehensive identification of variation in protein coding genes, non-coding expressed loci, regulatory sequences, and evolutionarily conserved regions, as well as detection of structural variation, and testing these alleles in a large case/control series of the same ethnic and geographic origin offers significant advantages over prior study designs, and has the potential to identify individual alleles, variant enriched genes, variant enriched non-genic sequences, and/or variant enriched genesets contributing to SCH risk in the Irish population.

"An Integrative Analysis of Structural Variation for the 1000 Genomes Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural variation (SV), involving deletions, duplications, insertions and inversions of DNA segments, accounts for a large proportion of human genetic diversity. Comprehensive identification and analysis of these genetic variants will help us more fully elucidate the biology of their functional effects on human health and demography. Despite recent advances, the tools and data needed to comprehensively identify all types of SVs, genotype each variant, integrate and phase these variants remain lacking. Indeed, the data released from the early phases of the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) (1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010; 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) are biased primarily towards the detection of deletions within relatively unique regions of the genome. As a consortium, we propose to pool expertise from various research groups to provide an integrative analysis of SVs by combining rigorous computational algorithmic development with extensive experimental validation.

"Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of sequencing-based functional genomic data profiling the transcriptome, regulome and epigenome in hundreds of diverse cellular contexts has spurred the development of powerful computational methods to learn integrative models of gene regulation. However, models learned on data from static cellular contexts only reveal correlative regulatory relationships. There is a paucity of tractable model systems and experiments profiling dynamic cellular processes and a corresponding lack of computational methods that can learn putative causal mechanisms controlling the precise timing and temporal order of changes in genomic chromatin state and gene expression. Here, we propose novel machine learning methods to learn dynamic models of transcription regulation in the context of cellular reprogramming. In Aim 1, we propose deep learning frameworks with new interpretation engines that can integrate dynamic chromatin accessibility and gene expression data to reveal networks of cis regulatory elements, transcription factor binding complexes and cascades of trans-acting regulatory factors that control cell fate. In Aim2, we will apply our modeling framework to investigate early dynamics of nuclear reprogramming of human fibroblasts to pluripotency. We will leverage a powerful heterokaryon cell fusion model system to generate global chromatin and gene expression profiles over a two day timecourse. In Aim 3, we perform perturbation experiments using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to validate hypotheses generated by our models and test the effectiveness of predicted pluripotency factors and regulatory elements in inducing reprogramming. The validation experiments will be further used to iteratively refine the computational models. We will integrate the time-course data generated in our model system with data from large reference compendia of functional genomic data such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Our analyses will reveal molecular mechanisms crucial to early and transient stages of nuclear reprogramming, providing novel contributions to our fundamental knowledge of regenerative medicine. Finally, the proposed end-to-end integrative framework is highly generalizable and will be of broad utility to learn dynamic models of transcriptional regulation from time-course datasets in other model systems. NARRATIVE Understanding how cells precisely control the timing and order of gene expression changes during dynamic cellular processes remains a challenge. Here, we propose the development of novel machine learning methods based on deep neural networks to decipher dynamic regulatory networks controlling cell fate decisions. We will generate genome-wide temporal profiles of chromatin state and gene expression during nuclear reprogramming, learn integrative models of dynamic gene regulation and perform experiments to validate biological hypotheses generated by the model.",Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming,9368022,R01HG009674,"['Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' v-myc Avian Myelocytomatosis Viral Oncogene Cellular Homolog ', ' cmyc ', ' c myc ', ' c-myc Genes ', ' Generations ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' embryonic stem cell ', ' stem cell of embryonic origin ', ' ES cell ', ' heterokaryon ', ' Gene Silencing ', ' Gene Inactivation ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' novel ', ' genetic regulatory protein ', ' regulatory gene product ', ' Regulatory Protein ', ' Modeling ', ' Pluripotent Stem Cells ', ' functional genomics ', ' Gene Order ', ' Gene Position ', ' Gene Arrangement ', ' Genomics ', ' RNA Interference ', ' Sequence-Specific Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' RNAi ', ' RNA Silencing ', ' Quelling ', ' Posttranscriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Cell fusion ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Cell Fate Control ', ' Cell Fate Regulation ', ' Transcription Factor 3 ', ' Transcription Factor E2-Alpha ', ' Kappa-E2-Binding Factor ', ' Immunoglobulin Transcription Factor 1 ', ' E2A Immunoglobulin Enhancer Binding Factor E47 ', ' E2A Immunoglobulin Enhancer Binding Factor E12 ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Knockout ', ' Knock-out ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' nuclear reprogramming ', ' epigenomics ', ' feeding ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' combinatorial ', ' loss of function ', ' pluripotency ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ', ' epigenome ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' genome editing ', ' genomic editing ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' transcriptome ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR method ', ' genomic data ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,694416,0.052145412915606155
"HIV-1 Tat genetic variation impacts NeuroAIDS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 has demonstrated the ability to cause adverse neurological complications. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in improved survival, reduced viral loads, increased CD4 T- cell counts, reduced opportunistic infections, and has resulted in a decrease in the most severe form of HIV- associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), HIV-associated dementia (HAD). However, the overall prevalence of all forms of HAND has increased, potentially because HIV-1-infected individuals are living longer with persistent infection. In addition to activating an antiviral immne response within the CNS, the production of HIV-1 proteins leads to neurotoxicity through direct and indirect mechanisms. Of particular interest is the HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat, which in addition to driving viral transcription also functions as an extracellular neurotoxic protein, activator of astrocytes and microglial cells, and impacts the structure and function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Tat is released by infected monocytes, microglial cells, and astrocytes in addition to infected lymphocytes. Tat can be continually produced by HIV-1-infected cells located in the CNS despite the widespread use of HAART, demonstrating that neurologic vulnerability to this protein persists in the HAART era. In addition, mRNA levels for Tat are elevated in brain extracts from individuals with HAD. HIV-1 also displays extensive sequence variation with the quasispecies shaped by many host-specific and comorbidity pressures, while simultaneously maintaining functions that are critical to replication and infectivity as well as pathogenesis. Studies with respect to subtype B Tat genetic variation and HAND have demonstrated (i) Tat sequences from patients in the absence or presence of HAD showed clustering of sequences with respect to neurological impairment as well as tissue of origin, (ii) nonsynonymous versus synonymous mutation rates among brain-derived Tat sequences from patients with HAND were significantly greater than those isolated from patients without neurological disease, and (iii) variation at positions 74 and 100 were correlated to Tat sequences isolated from brain-derived sequences. Importantly, HIV-1 Tat derived from HAD patients has been associated with greater neuronal death. Together, these reports suggest that genetic diversity of HIV-1 Tat likely contributes to the establishment and severity of HAND. Given this, the hypothesis of this application is that patient-derived genetic variants of the HIV- protein Tat are specifically linked with neurologic impairment. To explore this hypothesis, the Specific Aims are to: (1) identify and characterize polymorphisms in HIV-1 Tat from patients with defined degrees of neurocognitive impairment; (2) examine the structural impact of HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms in protein-protein molecular models; and (3) examine the functional impact of the Tat polymorphisms on the BBB and cells of the CNS. These studies will contribute to defining how HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms affect the function of the CNS and the development of HAND and provide information useful in development of diagnostic assays of HAND and potential preventative and treatment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed research is to identify and characterize genetic variation in the HIV-1 regulatory protein Tat with respect to alteration in it functional impact on cells of the CNS as well as the blood- brain barrier (BBB). This will be accomplished by examining amino acid changes within peripherally-derived and CNS-derived Tat proteins from neurologically impaired and unimpaired HIV-1-infected patients to define how HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms affect the development of HIV-associated neurologic disorders (HAND) and provide information useful in development of diagnostic assays of HAND and potential therapeutic strategies and vaccines.",HIV-1 Tat genetic variation impacts NeuroAIDS,9193105,R01NS089435,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune

"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important. We propose detailed characterization of cell-type appropriate genome-wide regulatory sequence catalogs, isolating labeled dopaminergic neurons ex vivo at multiple time points (Aim 1). We will functionally validate the catalogs and define the sequence motifs that specify their function, developing computational classifiers to identify human DA enhancers, and assaying the functional impact of disease-associated variants therein (Aim 2). We will determine the relationship between distal-acting regulatory sequences and their cognate genes using cutting edge chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based strategies to reveal enhancers- promoter interactions. Then we will determine the consequences of deleting selected enhancers using contemporary genome editing strategies (Aim 3). This proposal takes crucial next steps towards a neuronal regulatory lexicon that can inform our observation of disease-associated variation in non-coding, putative regulatory sequence space. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We wish to better understand how the regulatory instructions are encoded in DNA sequence, telling critical genes when and where to be switched on/off.

"Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genotyping and emerging sequencing technologies have enabled comprehensive interrogation of genetic variation across the human genome, thereby facilitating a study's ability to map genetic variants that influence phenotypes of interes. Nevertheless, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects have uncovered only a limited number of trait-influencing loci. While large increases in sample size will improve power to detect such variation, the ascertainment and sequencing/genotyping of such samples are costly and inefficient. Therefore, it is desirable to increase power to detect such variants without requiring additional sample collection. We propose novel methods for improved gene mapping of common and rare susceptibility variants that move beyond standard strategies typically applied to GWAS and NGS studies of complex traits. The first topic we consider is pleiotropic or cross- phenotype effects of genetic variants. Empirical studies have suggested that pleiotropy is widespread throughout the genome and that leveraging this additional information for gene mapping yields a more powerful analysis than an analysis that ignores such information. In Aim 1, we propose novel statistical methods for genetic analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data using an innovative kernel distance-covariance (KDC) framework that allows for an arbitrary number of phenotypes both continuous and/or categorical in nature, as well as an arbitrary number of genotypes (permitting gene-based testing of both rare and common variants). We will use the KDC framework to implement tests of pleiotropy as well as tests of mediation. The second topic we consider is the mapping of rare susceptibility variants using affected pedigrees, which provide many attractive features for rare-variant testing that case-control studies lack. In Aim 2, we propose a series of powerful statistical methods for rare-variant association testing in affected pedigrees that are based on a framework (recently published in AJHG) for rare-variant association testing in affected sibships. The existing framework compares rare-variant burden in a region by an affected sib pair to the number of regions that pairs shares identical by descent. We have shown the method is more powerful than case-control association testing given fixed sample size and further is robust to population stratification. In this proposal, we will extend the framework to handle affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure (rather than just affected sib pairs) and devise a powerful two-stage screening and validation strategy for rare-variant mapping that first compares familial cases in the pedigrees to external controls and then follows up the most interesting findings using an independent test based on our identity-by-descent sharing statistic among the affected relatives used in the first stage. We will apply the methods in Aims 1-2 to relevant data from genetic studies of complex traits in which we are directly involved. We also will implement the methods in public user-friendly software (Aim 3). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a set of statistical approaches to investigate two important topics in gene- mapping studies of complex human traits. First, we will develop techniques for identifying genes that have pleiotropic effects on phenotypes of possibly high dimension and further assess whether such genes have direct effects on such phenotypes or indirect effects through other possible factors.

"Predicting gene regulation across populations to understand mechanisms underlying complex traits Project Summary A better understanding of the degree of transferability of genetic association results and implicated genes across populations has implications for precision medicine and can only be accomplished by studying the genetic architecture of complex traits in diverse populations. For many complex traits, gene regulation is likely to play a crucial mechanistic role given the consistent enrichment of regulatory variants among trait-associated variants. We have developed a gene-level association method called PrediXcan that harnesses the regulatory knowledge generated by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies to directly test for genes associated with complex traits. An advantage of this gene-based approach over other aggregate variant approaches is that the results are inherently mechanistic and provide directionality, guiding follow-up experiments and future drug development. The genetic contribution to population phenotypic differentiation is driven by differences in causal allele frequencies, effect sizes, and genetic architectures. We propose to broaden the scope of PrediXcan to include diverse populations by (1) optimizing predictors of gene expression within and across diverse populations in multiple tissues and (2) performing gene-level association studies and quantifying regulability on a range of phenotypes in non-European populations. We will use machine learning to optimize predictive models of gene expression in datasets with both genome-wide genotype and gene expression data. We will integrate prior results from larger European populations when appropriate. Based on preliminary results, we expect a range of predictive power (assessed by cross-validation R2) will be observed across genes dependent on the heritability of each gene expression trait and differences in allele frequencies and effect sizes among populations. We will compare populations by 1) calculating the correlation between heritability estimates and cross-validated prediction performance and by 2) by calculating trans-population genetic effect size correlations (allele frequency independent) and trans-population genetic impact correlations (allele frequency dependent). The optimal models will also inform the underlying genetic architectures (sparse vs. polygenic) of gene expression traits and how they vary across populations. As we have done for European populations, the predictive models and heritability estimates developed here will be added to an open access database for use in PrediXcan and other studies. We hypothesize that PrediXcan will increase power to identify genes and implicate mechanisms underlying complex traits and that we can quantify the overall effect of phenotypic variation explained by transcriptome regulation within and across populations. We will compare gene-level results across populations to determine if the same and/or unique genes and pathways are implicated for a particular phenotype. We will estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance explained collectively by all gene expression levels, which we name the regulability of a trait. All results, scripts, and software will be available in publicly accessible databases and repositories. Project Narrative Differences in DNA sequence among individuals can lead to differences in gene expression levels, which in turn can lead to trait differences. We have developed a method that harnesses these DNA differences to predict gene expression levels, which are then tested for correlation with a disease or other trait of interest. Our project will lead to a better understanding of the degree of transferability of genetic association results and implicated genes across populations, which has the potential to improve the implementation of precision medicine among diverse populations and reduce health disparities.",Predicting gene regulation across populations to understand mechanisms underlying complex traits,9304684,R15HG009569,"['senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methods ', ' monocyte ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' Names ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' T-Lymphocyte ', ' thymus derived lymphocyte ', ' Thymus-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' T-Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Triacylglycerol ', ' Triglycerides ', ' Weight ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' ORFs ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' falls ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Height ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' lymphoblastoid cell line ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' drug development ', ' repository ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' genetic association ', ' Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' database of Genotypes and Phenotypes ', ' dbGaP ', ' precision medicine ', ' Genetic study ', ' transcriptome ', ' phenotypic data ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' GTEx ', ' data access ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NHGRI,LOYOLA UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R15,2017,429000,0.05308591108474252
"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases. Here, we gather data from multiple cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and develop a novel statistical framework for integrative analysis of data across individuals, cell types, and time points. Our approach provides a transformative approach for understanding gene regulation and the effects of genetic variation on individual health.  ",Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation,9356566,R01GM120167,"['Affect ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ectoderm ', ' Elements ', ' Endoderm ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Germ Layers ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maps ', ' Mesoderm ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Phenotype ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' training transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Individual ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Supporting Cell ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Outcome ', ' transcriptomics ', ' human disease ', ' pluripotency ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' learning network ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' human genomics ', ' phenotypic data ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' genomic data ', ' data resource ', ' ']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,463781,0.13203592420148638
"UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACTS OF GENETIC VARIANTS IN MENTAL DISORDERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US, 46% are afflicted with a mental illness at some point of life. The management and treatment of mental disorders pose significant economical and social burden to the society. Many rare and common genetic variants, including SNPs and CNVs, are reported to be associated with mental disorders, yet more remain to be discovered. However, despite the large amount of high-throughput genomics data, there is a lack of integrative methods to systematically prioritize variants that confer susceptibility to mental disorders; additionally, despite the presence of many candidate variants for mental disorders, their disease-contributory mechanism remains elusive, so appropriate functional follow-up experiments cannot be designed. Altogether, these problems resulted in a large gap between the copious amount of data about genetic variation and our understanding of their functional impacts on mental diseases, which ultimately delays the development of targeted therapeutic approaches. To address these problems, we propose to develop a suite of novel bioinformatics approaches: (1) NeuroComplex, an information integration approach that leverages phenotype information and multiple sources of prior biological knowledge to rank genes by their likelihood of contributing to specific phenotypic presentations. (2) integrated MEntal-disorder GEnome Score (iMEGES), which leverages a two-layer strategy to predict the impacts of variants in personal genomes on mental disorders. The first layer uses machine learning algorithm to build variant deleteriousness scores for coding, non-coding and structural variants; the second layer integrates variant scores and NeuroComplex to assign pathogenicity scores. (3) a hierarchical model called CombOmics that incorporates cross-omics information to characterizes how variants confers disease risk, in order to help formulate hypothesis of pathogenicity and facilitate the design of functional follow-up experiments. (4) we will develop user-friendly software tools and web applications that implement all the aforementioned bioinformatics approaches, and continuously release and maintain these tools to ensure the maximum benefits to the scientific community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop novel informatics approaches to understand how genetic variation impacts various mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism.

"GWAS TO GENE FUNCTION: NOS1AP AND OTHER QT INTERVAL GENES DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the electrographic QT-interval, an intermediate trait that impacts the risks of long QT syndrome and sudden cardiac death, have identified 68 independent variants at 35 loci, explaining 8% of the phenotypic (20% of the additive) variance. Nevertheless, the identity, function and mechanisms of action of the underlying DNA sequence variants and genes remain unknown, and are major impediments for understanding the molecular structure and functional architecture of this complex phenotype.

"RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome PROJECT SUMMARY The Human RegulomeDB project provides an essential resource that facilitates medical research and exploratory investigations of gene regulation. The majority of sequence variation identified in genome sequencing projects and disease association studies (GWAS) lie within the 98% of the human genome that is non-exomic. RegulomeDB is a unique web accessible resource that provides integrated knowledge of the wealth of existing information concerning regulatory elements that lie within non-exomic regions. The unique feature of this resource is its ability to comprehensively annotate, integrate and display the experimentally defined functional and biochemical regulatory elements of the human genome. Information generated from individual laboratories and consortia concerning potential regulatory regions such as that affecting gene expression, transcription factor binding, chromatin modification and DNA methylation will be collected from the literature, and integrated into a common database and displayed at nucleotide resolution. The information can be readily accessed via a web accessible interface and related to sequence variations identified from large scale projects (e.g. db SNPs, 1000 genome project, GWAS studies). Researchers will be able to compare variants identified from personal genomes and large scale sequencing projects as well as GWAS studies to the wealth of information in RegulomeDB, and thereby rapidly gain knowledge of non-exomic information.

Achieving this goal requires expertise across diverse domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for complex disease mapping, and expertise in management of large-scale databases. Here, we have assembled a world-class team of medical and population geneticists, computer scientists, statisticians and clinicians, with leading expertise in the development of novel and scalable strategies for characterizing sequence variants and their role in disease. Importantly, our group has been at the forefront of development of resources, study designs and methods to enable genomic research in U.S. minority populations. Our project has three main objectives. First, we will develop an Automated Scalable Ancestry Pipeline (ASAP) for common disease mapping in diverse populations. ASAP will improve the computational efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods for ancestry inference and develop important extensions to linear mixed models (LMMs) and other mapping strategies leveraging local and global ancestry. We will also develop methods to refine phenotypes and identify common controls for disease studies and define endpoints. Secondly, we will develop tools and resources for trans- and multi-population rare variant discovery that incorporate patterns of local and sub-continental ancestry. We will also develop machine-learning tools for variant annotation that leverage ancestral information, patterns of sequence evolution, and protein structure in a unified framework. Furthermore, we will incorporate population-specific patterns of cellular phenotypes to improve functional prediction algorithms for non-coding and coding variants. Lastly, we will disseminate our results through web-based resource that empower the biomedical research community. We will augment existing resources including ClinGen by annotating and characterizing pathogenic variants across diverse populations. We will develop a secure web-server that allows sharing of summary statistics and analysis pipelines to enable discovery, fine-mapping and functional prediction of genetic variants. Our team has ample experience with NIH-funded consortia and is dedicated to meeting the overall GSP project goals through collaborative work with NHGRI leadership and other funded investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of our project is to accelerate the discovery of DNA variation relevant to health and disease by analyzing data from over 225,000 ethnically and racially diverse patients that will undergo genome sequencing. Of particular importance is ensuring we have powerful statistical methods for analyzing data from underserved groups including U.S. minority populations. Achieving this goal requires expertise across many domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for disease mapping, and expertise in large-scale databases.",Center for Multi- and Trans-ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases,9268656,U01HG009080,"['Algorithms ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Evolution ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Leadership ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Shoulder ', ' statistics ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Funding ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' disorder control ', ' disease control ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' genome sequencing ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Resource Development ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' NHGRI ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' patient privacy ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' large-scale database ', ' large-scale data base ', ' tool development ', ' public health relevance ', ' phenome ', ' Secure ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' Precision Medicine Initiative ', ' genomic tools ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' GTEx ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ', ' TOPMed ', ' online resource ', ' web-based resource ', ' web resource ', ' on-line resource ', ' internet resource ', ' web-based tool ', ' ']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,1222472,0.14060581964677274
"EMERGE PHASE III CLINICAL CENTER AT PARTNERS HEALTHCARE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eMERGE III Clinical Center proposal from Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank, clinical data in the electronic medical records (EMR) for >4 million participants from the largest integrated health care provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise and state-of-the-art genetic analysis. We propose three aims. (1) Aim 1. Discovery. We will test the hypothesis that common and rare variants from a custom chip including 50,000 loss of function (LoF) alleles will be associated with cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric and immune-mediated phenotypes derived from the EMR. We are currently genotyping 25,000 Partners HealthCare Biobank subjects with a custom chip that includes LoF alleles from 63,000 exomes that we have analyzed. (2) Aim 2. Penetrance and Pleiotropy. We will test the hypothesis that sequencing a set of established genes or loci will allow us to discover additional variation, and define penetrance and pleiotropy using EMR phenotypes. Rare variants in genes selected by the eMERGE network will be studied for penetrance and pleiotropic outcomes by PheWAS and chart review. In addition, we are poised to perform recall-by-genotype studies because all Biobank participants have provided consent for such callback. (3) Aim 3. Implementation. We will test the hypothesis that physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based upon voluntary return of actionable variants to provide safe and cost-effective benefits to patients. We will screen our entire Biobank population of 25,000 individuals for pathogenic variants in the LDLR gene, the leading genetic cause of premature coronary artery disease, and conduct an exploratory trial in disclosing this information. Biobank participants with pathogenic variants in LDLR will be offered enrollment into a randomized trial, in which their finding will be CLIA-confirmed, and in one arm, this result will be communicated to their physicians through the EMR. Over one year, we will collect the following outcomes through participant surveys and EMR queries: physician visits, laboratory testing, changes in medication prescriptions, LDL levels, medical costs and the number of family members screened and treated as a result of the intervention. We will collaborate with the entire eMERGE III Network to incorporate what we learn from this pilot trial into large-scale implementation protocols for the genes selected by the Network for sequencing. Finally, we will participate in all Network activities to enhance the movement of genetics into clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The discovery and clinical use of genetic variants associated with both rare Mendelian and more common complex diseases promises to dramatically change the practice of medicine. Our eMERGE III project will leverage a large Biobank and a rich electronic medical record to define the phenotypic impact of mutations emerging from sequencing and then return results on selected

"PROMOTERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.",PROMOTERS,9280975,R01GM092910,"['Affect ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Elements ', ' Explosion ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase ', ' RNA Polymerases ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases ', ' Specificity ', ' Stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Thermodynamics ', ' Thermodynamic ', ' Time ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Measures ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Funding ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' cellular engineering ', ' cell engineering ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Chromosome Positioning ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Collection ', ' To specify ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' combinatorial ', ' public health relevance ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' gDNA ', ' genome editing ', ' genomic editing ', ' synthetic genomics ', ' chromosomal location ', ' chromosome location ', ' chromosomal position ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,397299,0.03373204738570703
"Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages Regulatory networks that control which genes are expressed when, are critical players in the maintenance and transitions of different cell states. In mammalian systems such networks are established by a complex interplay of thousands of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, chromatin remodelers and signaling proteins, histone post-translational modifications and three-dimensional organization of the genome. Hence, the identification of genome-scale regulatory networks and their changes remains a computational and experimental challenge, especially for rare and novel cell types. Through recent efforts of consortia projects we now have rich datasets measuring multiple components of the regulation machinery in model cell lines. These data enable the creation of a more complete regulatory network for these cell lines. Can we use this information to identify networks in new cell types where measuring only a few components of the regulation machinery is possible (e.g. the transcriptome)? Can we leverage more complete regulatory networks to predict new cell types, and to predict the effect of network perturbations to cellular state? To tackle these questions, in this proposal we will develop innovative network reconstruction methods to identify regulatory networks in novel and rare cell types by leveraging their relationships to well-studied cell types, as well as to each other. Our methods will use the framework of non-stationary graphical models to represent cell type-specific regulatory networks and will use multi-task learning to incorporate shared information between cell types in a lineage. Methods in Aim 1 will infer modular gene regulatory networks for each cell type and additionally refine an existing incomplete or uncertain lineage structure. Methods in Aim 2 will identify cell type-specific directed dependencies among chromatin state and transcription factors and how they impact target gene expression through proximal and long-range regulation. Our methods will be applied to two cell-fate specification problems: cellular reprogramming and multi-cell lineage forward differentiation. In cellular reprogramming, regulators and subnetworks hindering reprogramming efficiency will be predicted and tested using genetic perturbation experiments. In forward differentiation, regulatory network changes that drive alternate lineages will be identified and tested. Successful completion of this project will provide two broadly applicable software tools that will enable researchers to (i) accurately identify regulatory networks and their changes between different cell states in complex cell lineages, (ii) examine interactions among multiple levels of regulation and their impact on cell type-specific gene expression, and (iii) efficiently identify the most upstream regulatory genes and subnetworks that change cellular states. Software tools from this project will be made available and will be broadly applicable to diverse types of dynamic biological processes in development and disease. Project Narrative Many human diseases are due to aberrant activity of genes in specific cell types. Transcriptional regulatory networks specify what genes must be expressed in which cell types and play a central role in the type and function of cells. Therefore, the ability to identify these networks in each cell type and the network changes that result in changes in cell type is important for a better understanding of human health and disease. Computational methods that can identify regulatory networks and their dynamics across related mammalian cell types offer a powerful approach to create better models of human disease and for regenerative medicine.",Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages,9353838,R01GM117339,"['Algorithms ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' Correlation Studies ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Health ', ' Histones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Distal ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Training ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Sample Size ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' genetic regulatory protein ', ' regulatory gene product ', ' Regulatory Protein ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' cell fate specification ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Alpha Cell ', ' α-cell ', ' Glucagon Secreting Cell ', ' Glucagon Cell ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Signaling Protein ', ' Signaling Pathway Gene ', ' Signaling Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' human disease ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' epigenome ', ' learning network ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' transcriptome ', ' genomic data ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,303220,0.07843373973118173
"Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical genetic testing has become standard-of-care for many diseases including hundreds of inherited conditions. However, interpreting genetic test results is often confounded by the discovery of 'variants of unknown significance' (VUS) for which there is insufficient data or inadequate predictive tools to establish whether or not a particular variant predisposes to a disease. This problem is particularly vexing for genetic disorders with strong allelic heterogeneity and a preponderance of 'private' mutations such as the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), which predisposes young adults and children to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias. With the anticipated incorporation of personal exome or genome data into routine clinical care, interpreting VUS will become an even greater challenge especially when variants in genes associated with human disorders are incidentally discovered. Unfortunately, there are no reliable methods to predict a priori whether a given variant predisposes an individual to a particular disorder or whether the change is merely a benign rare variant. We propose to develop a novel paradigm for distinguishing disease-causing mutations from benign variants in LQTS as a model for other inherited arrhythmia syndromes and channelopathies. We will focus on variants in KCNQ1, the most commonly mutated gene in LQTS. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a holistic predictive model that relates experimentally determined protein structure and dynamics to function and disease is highly accurate even for novel variants. Our ultimate objectives are to develop a data-trained, web-accessible algorithm that classifies VUS discovered in KCNQ1 based on reliable predictions of the structure and dynamics of the affected protein, and to achieve prediction accuracy to levels needed to inform medical decisions. The medical importance of correctly classifying KCNQ1 variants provides strong justification for having a dedicated and highly-tailored gene-specific prediction model. The ability to distinguish deleterious from neutral variants would help avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in carriers of benign alleles, and save the lives of those with true mutations. We propose to collect extensive electrophysiological, biochemical and structural data on a large set of KCNQ1 variants discovered in LQTS subjects as well as several suspected benign or neutral variants (Aims 1-2), then use these data to iteratively train and validate a machine learning based algorithm that can differentiate benign from deleterious KCNQ1 alleles among a set of new VUS (Aim 3). Our proposal is innovative in the use of a multidisciplinary approach to functionally and structurally annotate genomic variant data for a medically important gene at an unprecedented scale, and then to use these experimental findings to train/test a novel computational system to achieve clinical-grade predictions. Targeting KCNQ1 will also validate an approach for parallel work that can be utilized to predict the medical significance of variants in closely related potassium channels associated with heritable epilepsy (KCNQ2, KCNQ3) or deafness (KCNQ4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a cause of sudden cardiac death in children and young adults. We propose a multidisciplinary experimental approach including electrophysiology, biochemistry and structural biology deployed on a large scale to generate information on at least 110 genetic variants in the main gene responsible for LQTS (KCNQ1), which encodes a potassium channel required for normal electrical activity in the heart. Our final product will be a data-trained computational strategy that will outperform existing methods for accurately predicting the functional consequences of novel KCNQ1 genetic variants, enhance the value of genetic testing in LQTS and provide for more informed medical decisions.",Decrypting Variants of Uncertain Significance in Long-QT Syndrome,9313321,R01HL122010,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' arrhythmic agent ', ' antiarrhythmic agent ', ' Antiarrhythmic Drugs ', ' Antiarrhythmia Drugs ', ' Antiarrhythmia Agents ', ' Anti-Arrhythmics ', ' Anti-Arrhythmia Drugs ', ' Anti-Arrhythmia Agents ', ' Heart Arrhythmias ', ' Cardiac Arrhythmia ', ' Arrhythmia ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biochemistry ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Deafness ', ' Sudden Death ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Genes ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Ion Channel ', ' Membrane Channels ', ' Ionic Channels ', ' Long QT Syndrome ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Potassium Channel ', ' Potassium Ion Channels ', ' K channel ', ' Privatization ', ' Proteins ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Death, Sudden, Cardiac ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Stimulators, Electrical, Cardiac, Shock ', ' Electric Shock Cardiac Stimulators ', ' Defibrillators ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' cardiac rhythm ', ' heart rhythm ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' structural biology ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' protein transport ', ' Protein Trafficking ', ' trafficking ', ' Structure ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' gene testing ', ' novel ', ' Cell surface ', ' proband ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' protein structure ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' Protein Dynamics ', ' 1st degree relative ', ' First Degree Relative ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Molecular ', ' Cardiac ', ' protein function ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Heritability ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Implant ', ' web-accessible ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' standard of care ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' variant of unknown significance ', ' variant of undetermined significance ', ' variant of uncertain significance ', ' variant of uncertain clinical significance ', ' unclassified variant ', ' individual patient ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictive tools ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,1280593,0.15683172488267214
"From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. No changes from original submission Contact PD/PI: Chakravarti, Aravinda The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes. In this second renewal of the FEHGAS consortium, we propose new computational and experimental approaches to identify the TFs, CREs, and target genes, active in four blood pressure target tissues, so that the effects of causal BP affecting genetic variation can be tested, within identified BP loci and genome-wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding how BP variation leads to primary hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage, a major public health challenge.

"Regulation of mRNA splicing by intronic genetic variants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic variations in introns commonly impact cellular functions by causing alterations in mRNA splicing. The abnormal inclusion and exclusion of exons often change protein functions and cellular phenotypes. Although many intronic variations have known functions, with the adoption of next generation sequencing, many more intronic variants have been discovered for which the functional impact is unknown. Thus, it is important to be able to predict the impact of the variants without needing to test them all in expensive and laborious assays. Although there are informatics algorithms that predict the impact of genetic variants on pre-mRNA splicing, their ability to predict the effect on protein function and ultimately disease and therapeutic phenotypes is lacking. In addition, there is a need for high-throughput cellular assays to test the results of these predictions on cellular functions. The studies proposed here will fulfill these needs by developing algorithms that prioritize the intronic variants by their potential impact on splicing and gene function, and developing a high-throughput assay to functionally test thousands of these predictions. These novel technologies will be applied to the effect of intronic variants on the pharmacogenomics of two clinically important oncology drugs, clofarabine and paclitaxel. Our long-term goals are to be able to predict the functional impact of genomic variants on human disease and therapeutic response. Our central hypothesis is that intronic genetic variants alter mRNA splicing and consequently protein function that ultimately affects the cellular response to drug therapy. Our first aim will be to develop computational algorithms that prioritize intronic variants based on their impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Using a variety of genomic and structural features and large sets of genomic data, we will develop a bioinformatics algorithm specifically designed to prioritize intronic variants based on their potential impacts on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Our second aim will be to identify functional intronic variants associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. Using existing genomics and cellular cytotoxic response data from populations of human cell lines, we will identify functional intronic variants that contribute to individuals' responses to clofarabine and paclitaxel cytotoxicity. Our third aim will be to functionally test the impact of the prioritized intronic variants on pre-mRNA splicing and drug cytotoxicity. Using our novel high- throughput functional splicing assay, we will test the effects of predicted functional variants from Aim 2 on pre- mRNA splicing. In addition, we will validate the effect of the intronic variants on cytotoxicity using exon specific siRNA and CRISPR/Cas technology to manipulate the target gene splicing. Upon completion of these studies, we expect to have developed bioinformatics algorithms that can accurately prioritize the intronic variants based on their functional impact on pre-mRNA splicing and protein function. Also, we will have tested thousands of variants in a cellular pre-mRNA splicing assay and validated the impact of several of these functional variants on paclitaxel and clofarabine cytotoxicity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative The goal of this project is to design and implement a set of bioinformatics algorithms and high-throughput experimental assays for prioritizing functional intronic variants that contribute to phenotypic differences by affecting pre-mRNA splicing. The developed model, including a molecular validation component, will be used to systematically evaluate the functions of such variants that are associated with drug-induced cytotoxicity. The same strategy can also be used to study the etiology of complex diseases.

"Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences The proportion of the human genome that underlies gene regulation dwarfs the proportion that encodes proteins. However, we remain poorly equipped for identifying which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to risk for both rare and common human diseases. Understanding how non-coding sequences regulate gene expression, as well as being able to predict the functional consequences of genetic variation for gene regulation, are paramount challenges for the field. Here, we propose to combine synthetic biology, massively parallel functional assays, and machine learning to profoundly advance our understanding of the `regulatory code' of the human genome. While challenging, the task of unravelling complex codes from large amounts of empirical data is not without precedent. For example, over the past decade, computer scientists working in natural language processing have made immense progress, driven in large part by a combination of algorithmic and computational improvements and enormously larger training datasets than were available to the previous generations of scientists working in this area. Inspired by the revolutionizing impact of “big data” for traditional problems in machine learning, we propose to model gene regulatory phenomena using training datasets with several orders of magnitude more examples than naturally exist in the human genome. We predict that the models learned from massive numbers of synthetic examples will strongly outperform models learned from the small number of natural examples. We will demonstrate our approach by developing comprehensive, quantitative, and predictive models for alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, two widespread regulatory mechanisms by which a single gene can code for multiple transcripts and proteins. However, we anticipate that this basic paradigm – specifically, the massively parallel measurement of the functional behavior of extremely large numbers of synthetic sequences followed by quantitative modeling of sequence-function relationships – can be generalized to advance our understanding of diverse forms of gene regulation. This research seeks to develop predictive models of alternative splicing and polyadenylation by learning from millions of synthetic constructs, orders of magnitude more than the number of endogenous examples. These models will be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease.",Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences,9475243,R01HG009136,"['Algorithms ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Phenomena ', ' Biologic Phenomena ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Computers ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dwarfism ', ' Nanism ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Isoforms ', ' synthetic construct ', ' synthetic DNA ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Polyadenylation ', ' RNA Polyadenylation ', ' Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' synthetic biology ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' human disease ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' exon skipping ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,590281,0.0807789455599627
"Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of sequencing-based functional genomic data profiling the transcriptome, regulome and epigenome in hundreds of diverse cellular contexts has spurred the development of powerful computational methods to learn integrative models of gene regulation. However, models learned on data from static cellular contexts only reveal correlative regulatory relationships. There is a paucity of tractable model systems and experiments profiling dynamic cellular processes and a corresponding lack of computational methods that can learn putative causal mechanisms controlling the precise timing and temporal order of changes in genomic chromatin state and gene expression. Here, we propose novel machine learning methods to learn dynamic models of transcription regulation in the context of cellular reprogramming. In Aim 1, we propose deep learning frameworks with new interpretation engines that can integrate dynamic chromatin accessibility and gene expression data to reveal networks of cis regulatory elements, transcription factor binding complexes and cascades of trans-acting regulatory factors that control cell fate. In Aim2, we will apply our modeling framework to investigate early dynamics of nuclear reprogramming of human fibroblasts to pluripotency. We will leverage a powerful heterokaryon cell fusion model system to generate global chromatin and gene expression profiles over a two day timecourse. In Aim 3, we perform perturbation experiments using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to validate hypotheses generated by our models and test the effectiveness of predicted pluripotency factors and regulatory elements in inducing reprogramming. The validation experiments will be further used to iteratively refine the computational models. We will integrate the time-course data generated in our model system with data from large reference compendia of functional genomic data such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Our analyses will reveal molecular mechanisms crucial to early and transient stages of nuclear reprogramming, providing novel contributions to our fundamental knowledge of regenerative medicine. Finally, the proposed end-to-end integrative framework is highly generalizable and will be of broad utility to learn dynamic models of transcriptional regulation from time-course datasets in other model systems. NARRATIVE Understanding how cells precisely control the timing and order of gene expression changes during dynamic cellular processes remains a challenge. Here, we propose the development of novel machine learning methods based on deep neural networks to decipher dynamic regulatory networks controlling cell fate decisions.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss

"An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease result from platelet thrombus formation at the site of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. Numerous studies have shown enhanced platelet reactivity, and increased platelet count and volume are risk factors for CHD events and fatality, and a recent NHLBI Working Group concluded that variation in platelet reactivity is a major determinant of ischemic events, like MI or stroke. Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have identified numerous common genetic variants associated with the risk of CHD and platelet function parameters, but most of the positive ""hits"" are not causative of the phenotype. To understand the cellular mechanisms by which these variants affect platelet function it is imperative to know the repertoire of mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs expressed in the cell of interest. Our team has been a leader in the field of platelet transcriptomics as well as functional assessment of variants in platelet genes. We have profiled mRNAs and miRNAs from 183 subjects using multiple platforms and have also performed platelet RNA-seq on 14 different subjects. This information provides a critical ability to filter, prioritize and obtain variant functional insights for evaluating GWAS SNPs associated with MI, stroke and platelet parameters. We have identified 142 mRNAs and 9 miRNAs that are expressed in platelets and linked to these GWAS hits. The goals of this proposal are to identify, assay, and validate functional variation previously tagged in GWASs of platelet-mediated ischemic arterial disease and of platelet phenotypes. Aim 1 will identify GWAS-linked mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs that are functional in platelets. Candidate RNAs will be refined by association with platelet function, eQTLs and QTLs using our previously generated platelet RNA data. We will develop a supervised machine-learning, statistical pattern matching algorithm to prioritize likely platelet-functional genes. Gene-level assays in which we knock down mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA in our human megakaryocyte culture system, followed by assays for integrin activation and quantification of platelet number and volume will be used to confirm platelet functionality. Aim 2 will identify functionally divergent SNPs and haplotypes. We will impute missing SNPs and perform fine-mapping to the phenotypes of interest. Variants will be prioritized by association strength, annotation data, and predicted function using publically available resources and our own platelet eQTL data. Non-coding candidates will be tested by reporter gene assay and non-synonymous variants will be tested using functional assays in cell lines in which the endogenous gene has been silenced. We will validate our findings with a replication analysis in which we use an independent cohort dataset to quantify the association of the tested variants with the original GWAS phenotype. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Platelet-mediated arterial thrombosis in the coronary or cerebrovascular circulation is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in the U.S. Numerous DNA variations have been associated with these disorders, but the causal genes are unknown. This research will test whether genes near these DNA variations - and candidate variations themselves - alter platelet function or number to understand better the molecular mechanisms causing heart attacks and strokes.",An integrative approach to functionalize GWAS hits in MI and stroke,9528639,R01HL128234,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood Platelets ', ' thrombocyte/platelet ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Platelets Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', "" Hayem's elementary corpuscle "", "" Deetjeen's body "", "" Bizzozero's corpuscle/cell "", ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' brain blood flow ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' intracranial vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebrovascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular dysfunction ', ' cerebral vascular disease ', ' brain vascular dysfunction ', ' brain vascular disease ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Coronary Circulation ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Integrins ', ' Integrins Extracellular Matrix ', ' Introns ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' Megakaryocytes ', ' Megalokaryocyte ', ' Blood megakaryocyte ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks The goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods that will identify genes driving epistasis between quantitative trait loci. Genetic association studies in both humans and model organisms have been increasingly able to detect interactions among genetic variants that influence disease risk and pathogenesis. However, identifying which genes are represented by individual variants is a major challenge. Many variants influencing disease are situated between genes, and even those that are in genes may be representing an effect from a neighboring gene. In model organism studies the situation is even more problematic. In breeding experiments, genetic associations with phenotypes typically encompass large regions of DNA with many genes, and experimental follow-up to identify the genes responsible for the association is resource-intensive. To address this problem, we are developing computational tools to prioritize putative gene interactions in interacting genomic regions for biological follow-up. We use machine learning classifiers trained on functional gene-gene interaction networks and combinatorial optimization to identify likely candidate gene-gene interactions responsible for epistatic interactions between genomic regions. Our methods sift through enormous spaces of candidate interactions, retaining only those whose functional interactions identify as plausible for supporting the epistatic interaction. These tools hold promise to dramatically limit the resource-intensity of biological follow up of putative epistasis and to clarify the genetic architecture of complex disease. Genetic studies in humans and model organisms are critical to understanding how genes interact to influence disease. Standard association studies, however, do not identify individual genes, but rather large genetic regions containing many genes, and determining individual genes responsible for phenotypic effects requires resource-intensive biological follow-up experiments. We are developing computational methods to prioritize genes in these regions for biological follow-up, with the ultimate goal of speeding the discovery of novel roles of genes in disease.",Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks,9528022,R21LM012615,"['Algorithms ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bacteria ', ' Breeding ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Engineering ', ' Genetic Epistasis ', ' genetic epistases ', ' gene x gene interaction ', ' epistatic relationship ', ' Interaction Deviation ', ' Epistatic Deviation ', ' Epistasis ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Systemic Scleroderma ', ' progressive systemic sclerosis ', ' Systemic Sclerosis ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Training Support ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Letters ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' gene interaction ', ' mutant ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' trait ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' genetic association ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Address ', ' Copy Number Polymorphism ', ' copy number variation ', ' copy number variant ', ' Data ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Lower Organism ', ' Ontology ', ' Molecular ', ' Knockout ', ' Knock-out ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' combinatorial ', ' human disease ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' alzheimer model ', ' AD model ', "" Alzheimer's disease model "", ' systemic autoimmune disorder ', ' systemic autoimmune disease ', ' Combinatorial Optimization ', ' Genetic study ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' genomic marker ', ' genomic biomarker ', ' genomic data ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' high dimensionality ', ' human model ', ' genetic architecture ', ' ']",NLM,JACKSON LABORATORY,R21,2018,200175,0.09668618783030566
"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases. Here, we gather data from multiple cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, and develop a novel statistical framework for integrative analysis of data across individuals, cell types, and time points. Our approach provides a transformative approach for understanding gene regulation and the effects of genetic variation on individual health.  ",Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation,9552890,R01GM120167,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ectoderm ', ' Elements ', ' Endoderm ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Germ Layers ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maps ', ' Mesoderm ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Phenotype ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' cardiomyocyte ', ' Heart myocyte ', ' Heart Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiocyte ', ' Cardiac Muscle Cells ', ' Cardiac Myocytes ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Individual ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Supporting Cell ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' stem cell differentiation ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Outcome ', ' transcriptomics ', ' human disease ', ' pluripotency ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' learning network ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' human genomics ', ' phenotypic data ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' whole genome ', ' genomic data ', ' data resource ', ' genetic architecture ', ' ']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,543228,0.13203592420148638
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss

"Interrogating regulatory variants by multiplexed genome editing A major result from recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) is that the majority of genetic variants driving common human diseases lie in regulatory, rather than protein-coding, regions. Massive efforts to map epigenomic features such as localization of histone modifications (HMs) and transcription factors (TFs) have paved the way toward understanding the regulatory genome. However, dissecting the impact of an individual non-coding variant remains an unsolved challenge.  A variety of computational methods have been proposed, such as quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies and machine learning techniques. However, these methods still do not provide conclusive information about causality of any specific non-coding mutation and lack gold-standard experimental results for evaluation. Several techniques are used to experimentally test the impact of individual regulatory variants. For example, massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) synthesize thousands of oligonucleotides encoding mutated versions of putative regulatory elements placed in plasmids upstream of reporter genes. However, a major limitation is that tested sequences are outside of their endogenous chromosomal locus, and hence do not necessarily provide physiological relevance.  CRISPR enables targeted editing of genomic DNA. Indeed, CRISPR is widely used, but studies of individual point mutations have been primarily on a small scale and are usually limited to a handful of variants or to a single gene. The major throughput challenge in studying a specific variant using genome editing is in tying genotype to phenotype. Introducing individual mutations exhibits low efficiency, and thus there is a need for enrichment of the genotype or phenotype of interest prior to assessing the impact of a mutation on a phenotype, such as gene expression. Current enrichment methods either disrupt the physiological context or are low throughput. Recent efforts overcame these challenges using pooled editing to analyze thousands of mutations simultaneously, but were limited to variants in protein coding regions.  This proposal aims to develop a novel technique merging multiplexed genome editing of putative regulatory variants followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to simultaneously measure the impact of hundreds of non-coding variants on regulatory potential in their native genomic context. The key insight of the proposed approach is that mutations impacting epigenomic features can be measured both in genomic DNA and in phenotypic readouts such as ChIP-seq of TFs or HMs, avoiding the need for a selection step to connect genotypes with phenotypes. ​Aim 1 develops the pooled editing technique on a pilot set of previously validated regulatory variants. ​Aim 2 scales this approach to interrogate thousands of mutations at once. ​Aim 3 integrates experimental predictions with state of the art machine learning methods to evaluate and optimize computational methods for regulatory variant effect prediction. Recent studies have demonstrated that the majority of genetic changes in the population contributing to common human diseases, such as schizophrenia, heart disease, and diabetes, lie in regions of the genome that do not code for proteins, but rather regulate the expression of genes. Despite massive efforts to map regulatory regions across dozens of human cell types, it is still difficult to predict the effect of an individual non-coding mutation. This project develops a high-throughput genome editing technique to simultaneously measure the impact of hundreds of non-coding mutations on regulatory potential in their native genomic context, with the ultimate goal of interpreting genetic changes leading to human disease.",Interrogating regulatory variants by multiplexed genome editing,9509167,R21HG010070,"['Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' oligos ', ' Oligo ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasmids ', ' Proteins ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Measures ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' ORFs ', ' Enhancers ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Point Mutation ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Evaluation ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' novel ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Cell Fraction ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Allelic Imbalance ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Mutate ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' Carcinoma Cell ', ' Malignant Epithelial Cell ', ' Molecular ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' human disease ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' gDNA ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' genomic editing ', ' genome editing ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' Hep G2 ', ' HepG2 ', ' Transcription Factor 14, Hepatic Nuclear Factor ', ' TCF14 ', ' Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor, 4 ', ' Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4-Alpha ', ' HNF4A ', ' HNF4-Alpha ', ' HNF4 ', ' HNF4A gene ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' ']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2018,196302,0.08331939268567216
"IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset PROJECT SUMMARY Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 200 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, meeting recruitment objectives and taking roles in IBDGC leadership positions. Our particular focus is on African American (AA) IBD genetics. We performed the first large-scale evaluation of European loci in the AA population, replicating several genes, but also finding unique African-ancestral variants within these loci, as well as identified multiple admixture significant loci. We also published the first AA IBD genome-wide association study (GWAS), a collaborative effort that identified two African-specific gene loci, and replicated multiple additional European loci. We have also explored why some loci with proven risk variants in Europeans and other populations only cause disease in one ancestral population but not others. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population. In this application we will re-evaluate the AA GWAS by better imputation, evaluate whole genome sequencing data to test low frequency and rare variants, and perform an evaluation for chromosome X variants. We will recruit a large number of AA IBD patients through our own and multiple Satellite Recruitment Centers to power a second AA IBD GWAS, both UC and CD, and meta-analyze with the first to identify more novel loci, identify more African specific risk variants, and replicate known loci for this population and replicate our admixture loci. We will also incorporate diverse data sources to incorporate into our GWAS analyses including RNA-Seq currently being generated on lymophoblastoid cell lines from AA CD cases and controls, and RNA-Seq that we will generate in colonic biopsies from UC cases and controls. We will evaluate chromatin differences and expression of genes in cell types relevant to IBD from European, AA and East Asian ancestries in an effort to better understand locus heterogeneity by ancestry. We will continue to participate in all IBDGC activities to maximize the Impact of IBD genetics research by this cooperative funding mechanism. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.4 million Americans suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic debilitating disorder with no cure that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD ranks in the top 5 in prevalence for gastrointestinal disorders and represents a significant financial burden to society requiring a lifetime of medical care. This proposed research aims to determine the genetic variations that cause IBD which will aid in developing preventive measures, improving the quality of care with better treatments and educating patients through genetic counseling.",IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset,9567544,U01DK062431,"['Algorithms ', ' Biopsy ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ',

"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions. Proteins that bind throughout the human genome control the genes that govern human health. Precise identification of the positional organization of these proteins within complexes will inform us as to the mechanics of their action, and mis-action when diseased. This project will provide that high-resolution view.",Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes,9423525,R01GM125722,"['Antibodies ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA Polymerase II ', ' Pol II ', ' DNA-Dependent DNA Polymerase II ', ' DNA Polymerase epsilon ', ' DNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Formaldehyde ', ' Oxomethane ', ' Methyl Aldehyde ', ' Formic Aldehyde ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Libraries ', ' Maps ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Robotics ', ' Running ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' cross-link ', ' crosslink ', ' Site ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' protein profiling ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' syntax ', ' syntactic ', ' Base Pairing ', ' billboard ', ' Human Cell Line ', ' Multiprotein Complexes ', ' Macromolecular Protein Complexes ', ' genetic regulatory protein ', ' regulatory gene product ', ' Regulatory Protein ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' human embryonic stem cell ', ' human ESC ', ' human ES cell ', ' hESC ', ' protein complex ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' ChIP assay ', ' Chromatin Remodeling Factor ', ' chromatin modifier ', ' Chromatin Remodeling Complex ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' K562 blasts ', ' K562 ', ' K-562 ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Transcript ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' deep sequencing ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost efficient ', ' spatial relationship ', ' DNA-protein crosslink ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' epigenome ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' Hep G2 ', ' HepG2 ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' recruit ', ' human model ', ' Grain ', ' ']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2018,320584,0.049510789958665063
"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,9420242,R01GM125639,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Crystallization ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Proteins ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Site-Directed Mutagenesis ', ' Targeted Modification ', ' Targeted DNA Modification ', ' Site-Specific Mutagenesis ', ' forest ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' mutant ', ' success ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Homology Modeling ', ' International ', ' Resolution ', ' Scheme ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' Population ', ' Coupling ', ' biological research ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' screening ', ' biophysical modeling ', ' biophysical model ', ' biophysical methods ', ' biophysical methodology ', ' biophysical approaches ', ' biophysical techniques ', ' Genetic study ', ' internet portal ', ' web portal ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' whole genome ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' human interactome ', ' ']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,577782,0.09885225456127447
"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs. Models will then be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and for the design of mRNA therapeutics.",A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics,9421497,R01HG009892,"['Affect ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Engineering ', ' Human Genetics ', ' In Vitro ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Polyribosomes ', ' Polysomes ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Ribosomes ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Thiouridine ', ' 4-thio-uridine ', ' 4-Thiouridine ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Genetic Translation ', ' mRNA Translation ', ' Translations ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' stable cell line ', ' synthetic construct ', ' synthetic DNA ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' computer science ', "" 5' Untranslated Regions "", ' mRNA Leader Sequences ', "" 5'UTR "", "" 3' Untranslated Regions "", "" 3'UTR "", ' Untranslated Regions ', ' UTRs ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' RNA Stability ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Property ', ' DNA Library ', ' DNA bank ', ' Genomics ', ' voice recognition ', ' protein expression ', ' mRNA Stability ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Expression Library ', ' Genetic Algorithm ', ' Genetic Programming ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' application in practice ', ' practical application ', ' comparative ', ' screening ', ' ribosome footprint profiling ', ' Ribo-seq ', ' ribosome profiling ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' polysome profiling ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,444578,0.10348166147571294
"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the 'early' detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to is development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to fine- map already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this two- stage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 ""convenience controls"" from the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the 'early' subclinical phenotypes identified through the use o VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1.

"Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION While accurate annotations of protein-coding regions in the human genome have been available for many years, annotation and interpretation of regulatory sequences has lagged far behind. This is because—in contrast to protein-coding sequences—the “rules” that govern links from genome sequence to regulatory function are fuzzy, complex, and highly context-specific. Our limited understanding of regulatory regions presents a fundamental challenge for the identification and interpretation of disease variation, especially in the context of personal genome interpretation. Work from ENCODE and other groups has started to close this gap through experimental work, including high-resolution maps of regulatory sites in a variety of cell types, and modeling of the cell-type specific mappings from genome sequence to regulatory function. In this project we will develop a suite of new tools that uses these diverse new data sets to tackle these problems. We will implement and apply powerful new machine learning methods (based on deep learning) to interpret the genomic, context-specific encoding of regulatory information, and to identify genetic variants that impact the encoded information. We will build models using data from a variety of sources including ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GTEx, regulatory variation in the HapMap cell lines, as well as from disease cohorts. Validation experiments will be performed using a new high-complexity CRISPR/Cas9 system developed by our team. We will develop software tools and analytical results that can be widely used for genome interpretation, especially in analysis of personal genomes. By the end of this study we expect to have: (1) developed powerful new computational models for predicting regulatory function in a wide variety of cell types, at unprecedented resolution; (2) implemented novel validation screens in native chromatin at extremely high throughput; and (3) developed new tools for interpreting common and rare regulatory variation, with particular focus on identification of high-impact regulatory mutations in personal genomes. We are committed to timely release of software, data and analysis and are committed to working with the ENCODE Consortium to increase the impact of data and analyses from all study sites. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this project is to develop powerful new computational methods to understand and predict the identity and function of gene regulatory sequences in diverse cell types. We will use these new methods to help us interpret common and rare genetic variation, and to identify variants that may contribute to disease. Outputs from the project will include new methods, software and functional validation data.","Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and

"Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages Regulatory networks that control which genes are expressed when, are critical players in the maintenance and transitions of different cell states. In mammalian systems such networks are established by a complex interplay of thousands of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, chromatin remodelers and signaling proteins, histone post-translational modifications and three-dimensional organization of the genome. Hence, the identification of genome-scale regulatory networks and their changes remains a computational and experimental challenge, especially for rare and novel cell types. Through recent efforts of consortia projects we now have rich datasets measuring multiple components of the regulation machinery in model cell lines. These data enable the creation of a more complete regulatory network for these cell lines. Can we use this information to identify networks in new cell types where measuring only a few components of the regulation machinery is possible (e.g. the transcriptome)? Can we leverage more complete regulatory networks to predict new cell types, and to predict the effect of network perturbations to cellular state? To tackle these questions, in this proposal we will develop innovative network reconstruction methods to identify regulatory networks in novel and rare cell types by leveraging their relationships to well-studied cell types, as well as to each other. Our methods will use the framework of non-stationary graphical models to represent cell type-specific regulatory networks and will use multi-task learning to incorporate shared information between cell types in a lineage. Methods in Aim 1 will infer modular gene regulatory networks for each cell type and additionally refine an existing incomplete or uncertain lineage structure. Methods in Aim 2 will identify cell type-specific directed dependencies among chromatin state and transcription factors and how they impact target gene expression through proximal and long-range regulation. Our methods will be applied to two cell-fate specification problems: cellular reprogramming and multi-cell lineage forward differentiation. In cellular reprogramming, regulators and subnetworks hindering reprogramming efficiency will be predicted and tested using genetic perturbation experiments. In forward differentiation, regulatory network changes that drive alternate lineages will be identified and tested. Successful completion of this project will provide two broadly applicable software tools that will enable researchers to (i) accurately identify regulatory networks and their changes between different cell states in complex cell lineages, (ii) examine interactions among multiple levels of regulation and their impact on cell type-specific gene expression, and (iii) efficiently identify the most upstream regulatory genes and subnetworks that change cellular states. Software tools from this project will be made available and will be broadly applicable to diverse types of dynamic biological processes in development and disease. Project Narrative Many human diseases are due to aberrant activity of genes in specific cell types. Transcriptional regulatory networks specify what genes must be expressed in which cell types and play a central role in the type and function of cells. Therefore, the ability to identify these networks in each cell type and the network changes that result in changes in cell type is important for a better understanding of human health and disease.

"Development of a Neuronal Regulatory Lexicon DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds upon our successes in the first funding cycle, and technological advances in in the wider scientific community. We will expand our understanding of the biology and sequence-based encryption of transcriptional regulatory instructions in clinically pertinent neuronal populations, focusing on tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)-expressing ventral midbrain neurons that are compromised in Parkinson's disease and certain behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years, we have made great strides in characterizing regulatory control at specific neurogenic loci by generating, validating and publicly depositing huge catalogs of neuronal enhancers. We have developed and implemented computational strategies that catalog key motif combinations that identify neuronal enhancers, and developed sequence- based vocabularies (classifiers) for neuroanatomical domains (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) among other more homogenous isolated cell populations. By integrating our experiences in functional and computational genomics we have been able to indict several disease-associated variants in pertinent biological processes. We are also beginning to develop the capacity to impute the functional impact of non-coding variation from primary sequence alone.  Efforts to understand the architecture of human complex disease through Genome Wide Association Studies have drawn increased attention to potential roles played by regulatory variation. Thus, understanding the connections between regulatory variants and disease risk is very important. We propose detailed characterization of cell-type appropriate genome-wide regulatory sequence catalogs, isolating labeled dopaminergic neurons ex vivo at multiple time points (Aim 1). We will functionally validate the catalogs and define the sequence motifs that specify their function, developing computational classifiers to identify human DA enhancers, and assaying the functional impact of disease-associated variants therein (Aim 2). We will determine the relationship between distal-acting regulatory sequences and their cognate genes using cutting edge chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based strategies to reveal enhancers- promoter interactions. Then we will determine the consequences of deleting selected enhancers using contemporary genome editing strategies (Aim 3). This proposal takes crucial next steps towards a neuronal regulatory lexicon that can inform our observation of disease-associated variation in non-coding, putative regulatory sequence space. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We wish to better understand how the regulatory instructions are encoded in DNA sequence, telling critical genes when and where to be switched on/off. We will focus on neurons that are lost in disorders like Parkinson's disease, prioritizing the study o genes implicated in related disorders.

"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,9564177,UM1HG009435,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type one diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1DM ', ' T1D ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1 DM ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Elements ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Logic ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE - Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' SLE ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Amino Acid Substitution ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' trait ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Computational Technique ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' K562 blasts ', ' K562 ', ' K-562 ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Lupus ', ' human disease ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' biological systems ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' Hep G2 ', ' HepG2 ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' CRISPRi ', ' CRISPR interference ', ' clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats screen ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 screen ', ' CRISPR-based screen ', ' CRISPR editing screen ', ' CRISPR screen ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2018,691199,0.16975207237621465

That is, we aim to define how genotypic variation affects 3D organization of gene promoters, and in turn, their expression. To achieve this at a genome- wide scale is an ambitious goal, because it requires having at a minimum, genotype, gene expression and chromatin interaction profiles in pure populations of specific cell types from a large number of donors. However, my laboratory is uniquely positioned to perform this research because: i) we are involved in a study at the La Jolla Institute (LJI-R24AI108564) that has already genotyped ~100 donors and expression-profiled more than 15 different pure populations of human immune cell types, and we have access to the same samples for chromatin interaction mapping, ii) in collaboration with other groups at LJI, we have already discovered a prototypical example of an interaction quantitative trait locus (iQTL) that alters and rewires interactions from the promoter of a specific gene that is associated with asthma susceptibility, iii) we have the necessary expertise and proven track record in experimental design and computational analyses of various chromatin conformation capture assays. Leveraging the resources available at LJI and our expertise in the field, we will build a unique research program around the novel concept of iQTLs. The emerging set of three main questions we propose to address within the next five years are: Q1) How do we define cell-type-specific iQTLs for common genetic variants? Q2) What is the extent of overlap between iQTLs and GWAS SNPs? Q3) Can we build predictive models for the cell-type specificity of chromatin interactions and iQTLs? Although we propose to define iQTLs only in two abundant, easily accessible, and highly disease-relevant immune cell types, the concept of iQTLs is equally important in other cell types implicated in diseases with a genetic component. Hence, the proof-of-concept developed by this work, without a doubt, will open up a new field in studying a previously uncharacterized role for disease-susceptibility variants, specifically non-coding SNPs, from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gene regulation. Narrative Recent discoveries that allow us to look beyond the one-dimensional sequence of DNA and understand the large-scale organization principals of its three-dimensional folding have been limited when it comes to characterizing the role of fine-scale genetic variations of the DNA code in controlling important cellular processes such as gene expression. This work will employ state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques and develop novel computational methods to define the role of such genetic variants in changing three-dimensional connections made by the promoters of genes in the human genome. This systematic and unbiased genome- wide study will have important implications in changing the way we study the disease relevance of genetic variation by revealing genotype dependence of long-range chromatin interactions between genes and their distal control switches at a scale that has not been achieved to date.",Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome,9576241,R35GM128938,"['Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Chromatin ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' Diathesis ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Dependence ', ' cell type ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Sampling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' histone modification ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Address ', ' Molecular Biology Techniques ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Gene Structure/Organization ', ' Gene Organization ', ' Gene Structure ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Population ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' graph theory ', ' chromosome capture ', ' chromatin conformation capture ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' ']",NIGMS,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R35,2018,449829,0.057334968924630206
"Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in cancer[1], common disease[2]and rare disease diagnosis.[3] Despite their success, our ability to fully interpret the clinical relevance of personal genome variation remains a significant gap[4-6]. Considering this, the most crucial need is more genotype-phenotype data that link genetic variation with disease causation. The objective of this proposal is to improve the clinical interpretation of genetic variation; in particular, by developing integrative approaches that predict the effect of genetic variation on clinical phenotype. This proposal addresses the hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, that combining patient transcriptomic data with genotypic and clinical data (as opposed to each alone) offers a better mechanistic understanding of disease natural history, from initial presentation to progression. The specific aims are designed such that each independently add substantial functional genomic information, over and above previously available patient genetic data, to further resolve the clinical phenotype. Aim 1 establishes a comprehensive and widely-shared dataset of patient transcriptomic (and genetic) variation across multiple cancer, cardiovascular and thrombosis/bleeding phenotypes, in patients with somatically-acquired myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and select other rare heritable blood diseases (HBD). Aim 2 methodically determines differential RNA expression and processing between clinically-relevant subgroups of MPN and HBD patients. Aim 3 brings these elements together – and applies two integrative Bayesian and machine learning approaches, RIVER[24] (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation) and LASSO[25] (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), to resolve the functional and clinical relevance of rare variants; and identify signatures most predictive of disease risk or progression. Completion of these aims will contribute new scientific knowledge on how integrating transcriptomic data improves clinical genomic analyses in other genetic (and rare) diseases. In addition, this project will enable the Principal Investigator to develop expertise in the informatics and data science aspects of genomic medicine that complement her current background in biophysics, biochemistry and translational hematology. Combined with additional informatics training at Stanford University through coursework, seminars, one-on-one advising from project mentors, and interactions with the wider statistics, bioinformatics and genomics communities, this project will prepare the Principal Investigator to launch an independent academic career in genomic medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate clinical interpretation of genetic variation in personal genome data is an essential component of personalized medicine approaches and the precise genetic diagnosis toward achieving improved public health. This project will integrate genetic and clinical modifiers with functional genomic information (RNA sequencing) from adequately-powered, disease-relevant cells; and provide direct insight into

"UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACTS OF GENETIC VARIANTS IN MENTAL DISORDERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US, 46% are afflicted with a mental illness at some point of life. The management and treatment of mental disorders pose significant economical and social burden to the society. Many rare and common genetic variants, including SNPs and CNVs, are reported to be associated with mental disorders, yet more remain to be discovered. However, despite the large amount of high-throughput genomics data, there is a lack of integrative methods to systematically prioritize variants that confer susceptibility to mental disorders; additionally, despite the presence of many candidate variants for mental disorders, their disease-contributory mechanism remains elusive, so appropriate functional follow-up experiments cannot be designed. Altogether, these problems resulted in a large gap between the copious amount of data about genetic variation and our understanding of their functional impacts on mental diseases, which ultimately delays the development of targeted therapeutic approaches. To address these problems, we propose to develop a suite of novel bioinformatics approaches: (1) NeuroComplex, an information integration approach that leverages phenotype information and multiple sources of prior biological knowledge to rank genes by their likelihood of contributing to specific phenotypic presentations. (2) integrated MEntal-disorder GEnome Score (iMEGES), which leverages a two-layer strategy to predict the impacts of variants in personal genomes on mental disorders. The first layer uses machine learning algorithm to build variant deleteriousness scores for coding, non-coding and structural variants; the second layer integrates variant scores and NeuroComplex to assign pathogenicity scores. (3) a hierarchical model called CombOmics that incorporates cross-omics information to characterizes how variants confers disease risk, in order to help formulate hypothesis of pathogenicity and facilitate the design of functional follow-up experiments. (4) we will develop user-friendly software tools and web applications that implement all the aforementioned bioinformatics approaches, and continuously release and maintain these tools to ensure the maximum benefits to the scientific community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop novel informatics approaches to understand how genetic variation impacts various mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism.

"Discovery of pathogenic germline variants in pediatric cancers using genomics. Project Summary/Abstract Genomic alterations drive cancer development in pediatric and adult patients, but pediatric cancers display a relative scarcity of somatic variants. This observation coupled with the earlier age of onset in familial cancer syndromes suggests that germline variants contribute to the development of many pediatric cancers. Many known pathogenic germline variants exhibit biological features such as loss of heterozygosity and rarity within the general population; certain germline cancer-causing variants also cause cancer when acquired somatically. Identifying pathogenic germline variants from whole exome sequence (WES) data would clarify the pathogenesis of pediatric cancers, and might support improved treatments for cancer subtypes with poor prognosis such as relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), high-grade glioma (glioma), and ependymoma. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the role of germline variants in pediatric cancer development using genomic data. The objective of this application is to develop a computational biology tool that identifies pathogenic germline variants from WES data, and to apply this tool to analyze germline variants in relapse ALL, glioma, and ependymoma. This application's central hypothesis is that pathogenic germline variants have biological and cohort-specific features that distinguish them from benign variants, such that a machine learning pipeline trained on these features can predict pathogenic germline variants. Aim 1 will call germline variants in WES data from 1) pediatric patients with known cancer-causing germline variants and 2) control patients without cancer; patients in data set 1) are randomly divided into a training and test set. A bioinformatics pipeline will call variants, add annotation, and filter out low quality variants. Aim 2 will use the training set to train and optimize a machine-learning algorithm to predict high confidence germline driver variants. Aim 3 will apply the final pipeline to validation sets of pediatric relapsed ALL, glioma, and ependymoma samples. These aims will generate a computational pipeline that predicts pathogenicity of germline variants using a pediatric cancer cohort, enabling improved understanding of the contribution of germline variants to multiple pediatric cancers. Project Narrative Improved understanding how certain germline DNA variants (those DNA changes that are inherited or occur early in development) promote cancer might lead to better treatments for pediatric cancers. However, identifying which germline variants cause cancer is challenging without genetic information from family members. To address this, this research proposal develops a computational tool that learns from germline variants known to cause cancer and then predicts cancer-causing variants from pediatric cancer patient DNA sequences in the absence of family information; these predicted variants will undergo computational and experimental testing, and may clarify how pediatric cancers like relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, glioma, and ependymoma develop.",Discovery of pathogenic germline variants in pediatric cancers using genomics.,9547342,F31CA210607,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Ependymoma ', ' WHO Grade II Ependymal Tumor ', ' WHO Grade II Ependymal Neoplasm ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Glioma ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ', ' acute lymphomatic leukemia ', ' acute lymphogenous leukemia ', ' acute lymphatic leukemia ', ' Precursor Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphoid Leukemia ', ' Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ', ' ALL -

"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer.

"Deep learning methods to predict the function of genetic variants in orofacial clefts Project Summary  Orofacial clefts (OFCs) comprise a significant fraction of human birth defects in all populations (ranging between 1/500 to 1/2500 live births) and represent a major public health challenge. Individuals born with OFCs require surgical, nutritional, dental, speech, medical and behavioral interventions, imposing a substantial economic and personal burden. There has been convincing evidence that non-syndromic OFCs represent human complex disorders with a multifactorial etiology including genetic risk factors, environmental exposures, and their complex interactions. So far, there have been ~10 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted for non-syndromic CL/P (NSCL/P) and >15 genomic loci reported with compelling statistical support, including genes such as IRF6, PAX7, and ABCA4 and the 8q24 locus. In addition, next-generation sequencing (NGS) as well as exome array have been conducted with extra depth of genotyping that enable detection of rare variants associated with OFCs. However, gaps exist in how to interpret these variants and how to identify novel variants from the large volume of data, with high expectations for new methods and new models for “second- analysis” of the genome-wide data. In this proposal, we propose two complementary aims to carry out deep and second-analysis of genome-wide data for OFCs. In Aim 1, we propose a deep learning method to build in silico models that can predict the effect of genetic variants in the context of rich craniofacial epigenomic features. With substantial fine map of sequence patterns, ad hoc motifs will be revealed and variants that disturb these motifs will provide mechanistic insights on OFCs. In Aim 2, we shift our focus to the gene level and propose a network assisted method to discover sensibly combined genes in spatial and temporal points that are critical to orofacial development. We target on all forms of OFCs, with particular interest in NSCL/P. To guarantee the success of this proposal, we form a multi-disciplinary team and local computational infrastructure equipped with GPUs for the implementation of both aims. Our aims are non-overlapping; rather, they are integrated and strongly focused on our fundamental question of interest: how genetic variants function to cause OFCs. The successful completion of our proposal will lead to deep understanding of genetic components in OFCs. Project Narrative Orofacial clefts (OFCs) comprise a significant fraction of human birth defects in all populations and represent a major public health challenge. Substantial progress has been made to identify genes and variants for OFCs through recent genome-wide association studies and next- generation sequencing projects.

"Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genotyping and emerging sequencing technologies have enabled comprehensive interrogation of genetic variation across the human genome, thereby facilitating a study's ability to map genetic variants that influence phenotypes of interes. Nevertheless, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects have uncovered only a limited number of trait-influencing loci. While large increases in sample size will improve power to detect such variation, the ascertainment and sequencing/genotyping of such samples are costly and inefficient. Therefore, it is desirable to increase power to detect such variants without requiring additional sample collection. We propose novel methods for improved gene mapping of common and rare susceptibility variants that move beyond standard strategies typically applied to GWAS and NGS studies of complex traits. The first topic we consider is pleiotropic or cross- phenotype effects of genetic variants. Empirical studies have suggested that pleiotropy is widespread throughout the genome and that leveraging this additional information for gene mapping yields a more powerful analysis than an analysis that ignores such information. In Aim 1, we propose novel statistical methods for genetic analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data using an innovative kernel distance-covariance (KDC) framework that allows for an arbitrary number of phenotypes both continuous and/or categorical in nature, as well as an arbitrary number of genotypes (permitting gene-based testing of both rare and common variants). We will use the KDC framework to implement tests of pleiotropy as well as tests of mediation. The second topic we consider is the mapping of rare susceptibility variants using affected pedigrees, which provide many attractive features for rare-variant testing that case-control studies lack. In Aim 2, we propose a series of powerful statistical methods for rare-variant association testing in affected pedigrees that are based on a framework (recently published in AJHG) for rare-variant association testing in affected sibships. The existing framework compares rare-variant burden in a region by an affected sib pair to the number of regions that pairs shares identical by descent. We have shown the method is more powerful than case-control association testing given fixed sample size and further is robust to population stratification. In this proposal, we will extend the framework to handle affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure (rather than just affected sib pairs) and devise a powerful two-stage screening and validation strategy for rare-variant mapping that first compares familial cases in the pedigrees to external controls and then follows up the most interesting findings using an independent test based on our identity-by-descent sharing statistic among the affected relatives used in the first stage. We will apply the methods in Aims 1-2 to relevant data from genetic studies of complex traits in which we are directly involved. We also will implement the methods in public user-friendly software (Aim 3). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a set of statistical approaches to investigate two important topics in gene- mapping studies of complex human traits. First, we will develop techniques for identifying genes that have pleiotropic effects on phenotypes of possibly high dimension and further assess whether such genes have direct effects on such phenotypes or indirect effects through other possible factors. Second, we will develop tools to facilitate identification of rare polymorphic variation that increase risk for complex disease using data from affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure. We will evaluate these methods using simulated data and illustrate their value by applying them to genetic projects of complex traits in which we are actively involved. Application of the proposed methods to these datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of various complex traits.",Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits,9405576,R01GM117946,"['Affect ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Joints ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' genetic pedigree ', ' pedigree structure ', ' Pedigree ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Risk ', ' Siblings ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic ', ' Genets ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' pleiotropism ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' user friendly software ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' gene testing ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Categories ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' genetic determinant ', ' genetic association ', ' Applied Genetics ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' cost ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' human disease ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' public health relevance ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' screening ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' Genetic study ', ' identical by descent ', ' IBD inference ', ' IBD analysis ', ' identity by descent ', ' phenotypic data ', ' population stratification ', ' high dimensionality ', ' new sequencing technology ', ' emerging sequencing technology ', ' novel sequencing technology ', ' ']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,297619,0.11673529291016699
"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes Project Summary/Abstract  The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions. Project Narrative Proteins that bind throughout the human genome control the genes that govern human health. Precise identification of the positional organization of these proteins within complexes will inform us as to the mechanics of their action, and mis-action when diseased.

"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases. The advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms will provide efficient big-data integration tools for epigenetics, gene regulation and human genetics.

"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,9696513,UM1HG009435,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type one diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1DM ', ' T1D ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1 DM ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Elements ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Logic ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE - Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' SLE ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Amino Acid Substitution ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' trait ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Computational Technique ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' K562 blasts ', ' K562 ', ' K-562 ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Lupus ', ' human disease ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' biological systems ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' Hep G2 ', ' HepG2 ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' CRISPRi ', ' CRISPR interference ', ' clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats screen ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 screen ', ' CRISPR-based screen ', ' CRISPR editing screen ', ' CRISPR screen ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2018,933353,0.16975207237621465
"Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm Orofacial clefting is a common disease that causes significant morbidity for the affected individual and a major burden to families and society. The etiology of orofacial clefting is complex, but genetic factors contribute significant risk. To date, scores of genes have been identified where rare variants cause rare syndromic forms of orofacial clefting, and DNA variants at 24 loci have been associated with the common non-syndromic form of orofacial clefting. Despite these efforts, less than half of the heritable risk has been identified. In addition, the pathogenic variant has yet to be determined at most of the 24 associated loci. New approaches are needed to identify these genetic risk factors. Since most of the associated loci are located between genes, it is hypothesized that the pathogenic allele is in a regulatory element. Thus, the new approaches should not only help find new candidate genes but they should also find the elements that regulate the expression of those genes. In this proposal, we will use a triumvirate approach to find new candidate genes, the DNA elements that regulate their expression and the transcription factors that bind to those regulatory elements. In total, analysis of these three datasets will yield a gene regulatory network for a target tissue. The target tissue for this proposal is periderm. Periderm is the most superficial layer of squamous epithelial cells that covers the entire embryo, including the oral cavity. Recent studies from human and animal models identified 19 genes that are essential for periderm development, and of these, 10 have DNA variation that causes or increases risk for orofacial clefting. Despite its significant role in palate development, little is known about periderm at the molecular level. The immediate goals of this proposal are to i) determine the gene regulatory network for periderm and ii) apply that new knowledge to identify alleles within the 24 associated loci that perturb the gene regulatory network for periderm. The longterm goals of this proposal are to identify genetic pathways that are essential for periderm differentiation and to identify the actual pathogenic DNA variants that perturb these pathways. This new knowledge will help determine recurrence risk and provide opportunities to develop new rational therapies. In particular, since periderm only exists in the embryo and since it is the most superficial layer of the embryo, it is an ideal target for in utero therapies, when and where orofacial clefting actually occurs. We have two parallel specific aims. In Aim 1 we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm differentiation in zebrafish by systematically perturbing the system. In Aim 2, we will use a parallel approach to determine the gene regulatory network for mouse periderm. It is essential to use both animal models because while studies of zebrafish periderm led to the identification of genes required for development of the lip and palate, the “periderm” between these two clades has a different embryonic origin and it is possible aspects of the gene regulatory network are different. Our project thus exploits the power and tractability of the zebrafish, and the human-like origin of periderm in the mouse. Orofacial is a common disease with a major impact on the affected individual, their family and society. Here, we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm, an embryonic tissue that is critical for development of the palate. Our new knowledge will identify candidate genes and help identify pathogenic variants located in regulatory elements which will improve risk assessment and provide new targets for rational therapies.",Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm,9783225,R56DE023575,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Separation ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Elements ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Epidermis ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Differentiated Gene ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lip structure ', ' Lip ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Patients ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Transposase ', ' Enhancers ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Public Domains ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' System ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' transgenic ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Palate ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' RNA analysis ', ' prenatal therapy ', ' in utero therapy ', ' fetus therapy ', ' Fetal Therapies ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' embryo tissue ', ' Embryonic Tissue ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Dominant-Negative Mutation ', ' Dominant-Negative Mutant ', ' Dominant Negative ', ' Antimorphic mutation ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vivo ', ' Periderm ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' oral epithelium ', ' oral epithelia ', ' oral cavity epithelium ', ' paralog ', ' paralogous gene ', ' vector ', ' orofacial ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' loss of function ', ' network models ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' exome sequencing ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' congenital structural malformation ', ' Structural Birth Defect ', ' Structural Congenital Anomalies ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' orofacial clefting ', ' orofacial cleft ', ' ATACseq ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' differential expression ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' whole genome ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' rare syndrome ', ' rare condition ', ' human model ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R56,2018,339622,0.12791999647020244
"EMERGE PHASE III CLINICAL CENTER AT PARTNERS HEALTHCARE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eMERGE III Clinical Center proposal from Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank, clinical data in the electronic medical records (EMR) for >4 million participants from the largest integrated health care provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise and state-of-the-art genetic analysis. We propose three aims. (1) Aim 1. Discovery. We will test the hypothesis that common and rare variants from a custom chip including 50,000 loss of function (LoF) alleles will be associated with cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric and immune-mediated phenotypes derived from the EMR. We are currently genotyping 25,000 Partners HealthCare Biobank subjects with a custom chip that includes LoF alleles from 63,000 exomes that we have analyzed. (2) Aim 2. Penetrance and Pleiotropy. We will test the hypothesis that sequencing a set of established genes or loci will allow us to discover additional variation, and define penetrance and pleiotropy using EMR phenotypes. Rare variants in genes selected by the eMERGE network will be studied for penetrance and pleiotropic outcomes by PheWAS and chart review. In addition, we are poised to perform recall-by-genotype studies because all Biobank participants have provided consent for such callback. (3) Aim 3. Implementation. We will test the hypothesis that physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based upon voluntary return of actionable variants to provide safe and cost-effective benefits to patients. We will screen our entire Biobank population of 25,000 individuals for pathogenic variants in the LDLR gene, the leading genetic cause of premature coronary artery disease, and conduct an exploratory trial in disclosing this information. Biobank participants with pathogenic variants in LDLR will be offered enrollment into a randomized trial, in which their finding will be CLIA-confirmed, and in one arm, this result will be communicated to their physicians through the EMR. Over one year, we will collect the following outcomes through participant surveys and EMR queries: physician visits, laboratory testing, changes in medication prescriptions, LDL levels, medical costs and the number of family members screened and treated as a result of the intervention. We will collaborate with the entire eMERGE III Network to incorporate what we learn from this pilot trial into large-scale implementation protocols for the genes selected by the Network for sequencing. Finally, we will participate in all Network activities to enhance the movement of genetics into clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The discovery and clinical use of genetic variants associated with both rare Mendelian and more common complex diseases promises to dramatically change the practice of medicine.

"Modeling gene expression in yeast using large degenerate libraries PROJECT SUMMARY Short sequence elements in DNA and RNA determine the levels and composition of mRNAs and proteins, making it critical that we can accurately model how any given sequence will affect transcription, splicing or translation. Such models of cis-regulation will fill in gaps in our knowledge of these core gene expression processes. Additionally, as large numbers of human genomes are sequenced, the ability to predict the effects of sequence variation on the ultimate levels of proteins will be integral to the interpretation of variation in regulatory sequences. Similarly, the construction of metabolic pathways with defined levels of expression and the engineering of synthetic gene networks require accurate knowledge of how regulatory sequences affect expression. This application seeks to use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a test case for learning how any short regulatory sequence affects protein levels. A predictive model will be trained on a set of libraries two orders of magnitude more complex than have been characterized to date. Libraries will be generated of a growth reporter gene with a million random sequences of 50 nucleotides that comprise either a DNA element that regulates transcription or an RNA element that regulates splicing or translation. The libraries will be transformed into yeast, and the yeast will be placed under selection such that they grow according to the ability of each random sequence to contribute to protein expression. A convolution neural network approach will be used to learn the relationship between these “fitness” phenotypes and their associated genotypes. Although yeast is a single-celled eukaryote, it has been the source of most of the original findings on gene expression, and these findings form the basis for much of our knowledge of more complex eukaryotes. Furthermore, the short sequences in yeast that comprise the DNA- and RNA-binding sites of regulatory proteins tend to be comparable in size to those of other organisms. Yeast is used often in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, and the work proposed here will result in novel tools for quantitatively controlling its gene expression. Initial results with a library of 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) indicate that we can construct a model to account for a large fraction of the observed variability in expression, and that the model extends to native sequence elements. The model allowed us to forward engineer 5' UTRs to have increased activity. Specific aims of this application are to assess the effects of random sequences targeted to upstream regulatory elements, core promoter elements, 5' UTRs, introns and 3' UTRs; to learn predictive and interpretable models using convolutional neural networks and to identify novel functional cis-regulatory elements; and to validate our models on native sequences and combinatorial libraries, and by engineering synthetic sequence elements with user-specified properties. In sum, the proposal seeks to construct a comprehensive and predictive model of regulatory sequence–function relationships for a well-studied single- celled eukaryote, providing a basis for similar studies on other organisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research seeks to generate a model for how regulatory sequences present in the genome of a simple organism affect the expression of a protein. These studies will be important for ultimately understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease. The results will also improve the ability to engineer metabolic pathways to produce a protein, chemical, drug or other compound.",Modeling gene expression in yeast using large degenerate libraries,9422149,R01GM125809,"['Affect ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Library ', ' genetic library ', ' Genes ', ' Synthetic Genes ', ' Artificial Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Introns ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' S cerevisiae ', "" Brewer's Yeast "", "" Baker's Yeast "", ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Ensure ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', "" 5' Untranslated Regions "", ' mRNA Leader Sequences ', "" 5'UTR "", "" 3' Untranslated Regions "", "" 3'UTR "", ' Untranslated Regions ', ' UTRs ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Eukaryota ', ' Eukaryote ', ' genetic regulatory protein ', ' regulatory gene product ', ' Regulatory Protein ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' DNA Binding ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' RNA Binding ', ' RNA bound ', ' protein expression ', ' Metabolic Pathway ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Sum ', ' Gene Expression Process ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' metabolic engineering ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' scale up ', ' Genome engineering ', ' synthetic biology ', ' combinatorial ', ' human disease ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' new sequencing technology ', ' emerging sequencing technology ', ' novel sequencing technology ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,372737,0.05337791272235894
"HIV-1 Tat genetic variation impacts NeuroAIDS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 has demonstrated the ability to cause adverse neurological complications. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in improved survival, reduced viral loads, increased CD4 T- cell counts, reduced opportunistic infections, and has resulted in a decrease in the most severe form of HIV- associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), HIV-associated dementia (HAD). However, the overall prevalence of all forms of HAND has increased, potentially because HIV-1-infected individuals are living longer with persistent infection. In addition to activating an antiviral immne response within the CNS, the production of HIV-1 proteins leads to neurotoxicity through direct and indirect mechanisms. Of particular interest is the HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat, which in addition to driving viral transcription also functions as an extracellular neurotoxic protein, activator of astrocytes and microglial cells, and impacts the structure and function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Tat is released by infected monocytes, microglial cells, and astrocytes in addition to infected lymphocytes. Tat can be continually produced by HIV-1-infected cells located in the CNS despite the widespread use of HAART, demonstrating that neurologic vulnerability to this protein persists in the HAART era. In addition, mRNA levels for Tat are elevated in brain extracts from individuals with HAD. HIV-1 also displays extensive sequence variation with the quasispecies shaped by many host-specific and comorbidity pressures, while simultaneously maintaining functions that are critical to replication and infectivity as well as pathogenesis. Studies with respect to subtype B Tat genetic variation and HAND have demonstrated (i) Tat sequences from patients in the absence or presence of HAD showed clustering of sequences with respect to neurological impairment as well as tissue of origin, (ii) nonsynonymous versus synonymous mutation rates among brain-derived Tat sequences from patients with HAND were significantly greater than those isolated from patients without neurological disease, and (iii) variation at positions 74 and 100 were correlated to Tat sequences isolated from brain-derived sequences. Importantly, HIV-1 Tat derived from HAD patients has been associated with greater neuronal death. Together, these reports suggest that genetic diversity of HIV-1 Tat likely contributes to the establishment and severity of HAND. Given this, the hypothesis of this application is that patient-derived genetic variants of the HIV- protein Tat are specifically linked with neurologic impairment. To explore this hypothesis, the Specific Aims are to: (1) identify and characterize polymorphisms in HIV-1 Tat from patients with defined degrees of neurocognitive impairment; (2) examine the structural impact of HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms in protein-protein molecular models; and (3) examine the functional impact of the Tat polymorphisms on the BBB and cells of the CNS. These studies will contribute to defining how HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms affect the function of the CNS and the development of HAND and provide information useful in development of diagnostic assays of HAND and potential preventative and treatment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed research is to identify and characterize genetic variation in the HIV-1 regulatory protein Tat with respect to alteration in it functional impact on cells of the CNS as well as the blood- brain barrier (BBB). This will be accomplished by examining amino acid changes within peripherally-derived and CNS-derived Tat proteins from neurologically impaired and unimpaired HIV-1-infected patients to define how HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms affect the development of HIV-associated neurologic disorders (HAND) and provide information useful in development of diagnostic assays of HAND and potential therapeutic

"Leveraging Tissue-Specific Regulatory Grammar to Interpret Human Evolution and Non-coding Variation Project Summary  It is now possible to readily identify sequence variants that have been subject to natural selection in human populations. Adaptive variants have been shown to underlie diversity in both disease risk and morphology across human populations, suggesting that the lens of evolution remains a powerful tool for understanding human biology, yet one that is currently underutilized. One challenge to realizing this potential is that over 99% of human genetic variation is non-coding, as are most signals of selection and variants associated with human phenotypic traits. Mutations modifying transcription factor (TF) binding sites in non- coding, cis-regulatory regions are hypothesized to be more amenable to driving phenotypic evolution than coding changes. These cis-regulatory regions are major determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and variation within enhancers has been indicated to play role in selection and disease. However, enhancer `regulatory grammar' – the complex pattern of sequences that interact with TFs to control gene expression, is poorly understood. The challenge of linking a regulatory variant under selection to an adaptive phenotype is similar to that facing disease association studies: the targeted gene, cell type, and biological process are often unknown, hindering further investigation.  Machine learning algorithms automate the discovery of patterns, making them well-suited to uncover sequence constraints and the combinatorial TF binding patterns of enhancers without relying on limited motif databases. I will optimize support vector machine classifiers to elucidate regulatory grammar from over 100 cell types and tissues. These models will be used to predict the impact of sequence variants on cis-regulatory sites, expanding the utility of the NHGRI's ENCODE and Roadmap projects. I will then apply these tissue- specific predictions to signals of selection and/or disease from the NHGRI's 1000 Genomes Project and its genome-wide association studies catalog. By describing the regulatory impact of signals of selection, I will globally describe patterns of functional adaptation across populations, identifying genes, and gene networks targeted by selection and/or disease. I will functionally characterize variants using massively parallel reporter assays and genome editing to give deeper insight into specific cases of evolution relevant for human health.    This project seeks to develop tools and resources to describe the structure and function of sequence variation in the human genome. This proposal seeks to vastly increase the number of elucidated cases of human evolution, and specifically characterize those adaptive variants associated with disease. We will share the functional regulatory predictions for the use in interpreting a broad range of genomic datasets. This work has broad implications, from interpreting genetic variants in populations and understanding functional targets of evolution, to prioritizing non-coding mutations for precision genomic medicine and beyond. Project Narrative While thousands of genomic regions have been linked to human evolution and diseases, many of the genetic variants responsible are non-coding and thus difficult to interpret. I propose to describe the tissue-specific effects of regulatory variants using machine learning algorithms, and then integrate these functional predictions with signals of selection and/or disease association in order to pinpoint genetic variants important for human evolution and health.",Leveraging Tissue-Specific Regulatory Grammar to Interpret Human Evolution and Non-coding Variation,9406681,F32HG009226,"['Algorithms ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Chromatin ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Evolution ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Logic ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Enhancers ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Mediating ', ' Natural Selections ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' Human Biology ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' genome database ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Data ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression ', ' Differential Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Gene Expression ', ' trend ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' NHGRI ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' disease phenotype ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' combinatorial ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' epigenome ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' genomic editing ', ' genome editing ', ' functional adaptation ', ' precision genomic medicine ', ' genomic data ', ' web-based tool ', ' ']",NHGRI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,57066,0.17322074226230802
"RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome PROJECT SUMMARY The Human RegulomeDB project provides an essential resource that facilitates medical research and exploratory investigations of gene regulation. The majority of sequence variation identified in genome sequencing projects and disease association studies (GWAS) lie within the 98% of the human genome that is non-exomic. RegulomeDB is a unique web accessible resource that provides integrated knowledge of the wealth of existing information concerning regulatory elements that lie within non-exomic regions. The unique feature of this resource is its ability to comprehensively annotate, integrate and display the experimentally defined functional and biochemical regulatory elements of the human genome. Information generated from individual laboratories and consortia concerning potential regulatory regions such as that affecting gene expression, transcription factor binding, chromatin modification and DNA methylation will be collected from the literature, and integrated into a common database and displayed at nucleotide resolution. The information can be readily accessed via a web accessible interface and related to sequence variations identified from large scale projects (e.g. db SNPs, 1000 genome project, GWAS studies). Researchers will be able to compare variants identified from personal genomes and large scale sequencing projects as well as GWAS studies to the wealth of information in RegulomeDB, and thereby rapidly gain knowledge of non-exomic information. Given the wealth of DNA sequencing project that are emerging, we expect this unique resource to have wide impact in the biomedical community. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH, PROJECT NARRATIVE The regulation of gene expression controls the determination of cell types, and aberrant gene expression can cause diseases such as cancer. RegulomeDB will enable researchers, clinicians, and sophisticated computer programs to relate DNA variants that lie in previously poorly understood regions of the human genome to possible functions thereby helping us understand the genetic basis of human variation and disease.",RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome,9420648,U41HG009293,"['Affect ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' electronic communication ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Elements ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Medical Research ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Data Quality ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' meetings ', ' outreach ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Documentation ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Resource Informatics ', ' Large-Scale Sequencing ', ' Process ', ' cell determination ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' web-accessible ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' genome annotation ', ' cloud based ', ' social media ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' whole genome ', ' DNAseq ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' ']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U41,2018,733299,0.07229456027355857
"Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families Project Summary: Although affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees have substantially elevated recurrence risk compared to singleton cases, the mean polygenic risk scores between these groups do not differ, suggesting that one source of this higher familial recurrence risk is rare, higher impact variation. We will collect whole genome sequence (WGS) from 600 affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees to identify rare variation shared by affected individuals within and between pedigrees potentially accounting for the increased recurrence risk, and reducing the `variant space' under consideration. After QC and calling in our existing pipeline, a) familial sequence variants in the exome will be directly analyzed in 2000 Irish cases and 2000 Irish controls with 30X exome sequence data in production currently, and b) variants outside the exome will be imputed into 3600 Irish singleton schizophrenia or bipolar disorder cases and 3000 Irish population controls with GWAS framework data; 3781 additional UK10K controls with 10X WGS are available to increase analysis power. This imputed dataset will be analyzed using recently developed methods for kernel-based tests of variation aggregated over a defined interval (such as a gene) that avoid the inflation of type-1 error. We use multiple sources of genomic information to develop weights for each position in the genome (indexing the prior probability that a change at the site has functional consequence) and each variant detected (indexing the probability that observed changes have functional consequence), and we propose to improve the existing genomic information sources for this weighting in a number of ways. In aim 3, prioritized variants from aim 2a/2b will be directly genotyped in the case/control samples by custom microarray; individual genes or genesets showing enrichment of variation in cases (if any are observed) will be resequenced in the case/control sample. In Aim 4, the directly assessed genotypic and sequence data from aim 3 will be analyzed using standard methods to identify individual associated variants, and variant-enriched genes, genesets or other functional sequences. We seek to unambiguously identify 1) individual variants that are significantly more common in cases, or 2) individual genes or other functional sequences or 3) gene- or functional sequence sets enriched for variation in cases to provide critical information about the brain systems perturbed in schizophrenia, and the mechanisms by which such alleles increase risk. Project Narrative Rare sequence variation has been implicated in many human complex traits, incuding schizophrenia, and has been studied in unrelated cases and controls and parent:offspring trios, but remains unstudied in multiplex families. Sequencing the genomes of such families will allow conprehensive identification of variation in protein coding genes, non-coding expressed loci, regulatory sequences, and evolutionarily conserved regions, as well as detection of structural variation, and testing these alleles in a large case/control series of the same ethnic and geographic origin offers significant advantages over prior study designs, and has the potential to identify individual alleles, variant enriched genes, variant enriched non-genic sequences, and/or variant enriched genesets contributing to SCH risk in the Irish population. Such variants offer great potential for understanding the functional impact of risk alleles and improving mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia and related disorders.",Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families,9555069,R01MH114593,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Ireland ', ' Irish Free State ', ' Eire ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Methods ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Parents ', ' genetic pedigree ', ' pedigree structure ', ' Pedigree ', ' Population Control ', ' Probability ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' trait ', ' member ', ' offspring ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' genome sequencing ', ' LGALS3BP gene ', ' MAC-2-BP ', ' 90K ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk variant ', ' power analysis ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' whole genome ', ' genomic data ', ' ']",NIMH,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,457798,0.17127245251259096

"Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract In the United States, the joint disease osteoarthritis (OA) debilitates over one-third of people over sixty-five years old and causes hundreds of thousands of knee replacements annually. Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate knee formation and OA risk and how one inherits risk at specific joints (e.g., knee versus hip). Recent GWAS have identified at least seventeen loci that significantly associate with knee OA risk. However, the casual variants for these loci have not been identified because their association signals span large genomic intervals harboring uninvestigated non-coding regulatory regions. Of these, common variants in the Growth Differentiation Factor Five gene (GDF5), a critical regulator of joint development, reproducibly associate with knee OA risk in human populations. GDF5 OA variants reside on a high frequency 130 kb haplotype possessing numerous mutations that each may be causal for OA risk, but interestingly, no protein coding mutations have been uncovered that explain the associations. In a complementary study, we discovered ten GDF5 regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers) spanning this interval and revealed that they function with tremendous joint specificity (e.g., knee vs. hip). These enhancers were initially tested at incipient stages of GDF5 expression in mouse embryos, but we also know that GDF5 contributes to the differentiation of knee structures (ligaments, tendons, menisci, articular surfaces) well after this stage of development. Our research will bring together knee OA risk variants in patient populations and our knowledge of how GDF5 is controlled at the DNA level. We first aim to assess the functional contributions of joint-specific GDF5 enhancers to pre-natal knee development and adult joint homeostasis using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to excise these elements in vitro in human cells and in vivo in the mouse. Strikingly, our pilot analyses also revealed that a subset of these GDF5 enhancers possesses common and rare human variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with the highest associated OA variants in the interval. Our second aim is to further explore the association between genetic variants in the locus and OA knee shape using data acquired from the complete Osteoarthritis Initiative MR database on adult knees. Our preliminary data reveal that several variants associated with OA knee shape reside in several functional enhancers that control expression of GDF5 in the knee. Finally, our third aim is to functionally test these human regulatory variants for their impact on enhancer activity, knee formation, and OA risk by using transfection studies and CRISPR-Cas9 in human cartilage cells and in the mouse model. Completion of these studies will reveal functional variants in GDF5 that underlie its role in knee shape and OA risk. Project Narrative The Growth Differentiation Factor Five (GDF5) gene is the most reproducibly detected gene region in candidate and genome-wide association studies focusing on knee osteoarthritis risk. The proposed research focuses on (1) assessing the specific functions of key GDF5 regulatory sequences in knee development and cartilage maintenance in mice and humans, (2) the association of genetic variants in GDF5 locus with osteoarthritis knee shape, and (3) the impacts that human GDF5 risk mutations have on chondrocyte and joint biology.",Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind

We propose to develop scalable methods that incorporate ancestry to optimize medical genomic study design and improve power for uncovering the role of common and rare variants in disease. Achieving this goal requires expertise across diverse domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for complex disease mapping, and expertise in management of large-scale databases. Here, we have assembled a world-class team of medical and population geneticists, computer scientists, statisticians and clinicians, with leading expertise in the development of novel and scalable strategies for characterizing sequence variants and their role in disease. Importantly, our group has been at the forefront of development of resources, study designs and methods to enable genomic research in U.S. minority populations. Our project has three main objectives. First, we will develop an Automated Scalable Ancestry Pipeline (ASAP) for common disease mapping in diverse populations. ASAP will improve the computational efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods for ancestry inference and develop important extensions to linear mixed models (LMMs) and other mapping strategies leveraging local and global ancestry. We will also develop methods to refine phenotypes and identify common controls for disease studies and define endpoints. Secondly, we will develop tools and resources for trans- and multi-population rare variant discovery that incorporate patterns of local and sub-continental ancestry. We will also develop machine-learning tools for variant annotation that leverage ancestral information, patterns of sequence evolution, and protein structure in a unified framework. Furthermore, we will incorporate population-specific patterns of cellular phenotypes to improve functional prediction algorithms for non-coding and coding variants. Lastly, we will disseminate our results through web-based resource that empower the biomedical research community. We will augment existing resources including ClinGen by annotating and characterizing pathogenic variants across diverse populations. We will develop a secure web-server that allows sharing of summary statistics and analysis pipelines to enable discovery, fine-mapping and functional prediction of genetic variants. Our team has ample experience with NIH-funded consortia and is dedicated to meeting the overall GSP project goals through collaborative work with NHGRI leadership and other funded investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of our project is to accelerate the discovery of DNA variation relevant to health and disease by analyzing data from over 225,000 ethnically and racially diverse patients that will undergo genome sequencing. Of particular importance is ensuring we have powerful statistical methods for analyzing data from underserved groups including U.S. minority populations.

"Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recognized as an extremely common disorder that results in excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of automobile crashes. It is also an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiovascular events, increased cancer rates and cancer mortality, and accelerates the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. OSA is a systemic disorder and the cyclical intermittent hypoxia that occurs during sleep affects every organ system. OSA is heritable, with first degree relatives of individuals with OSA having a two-fold increased risk of the disorder. Although this has been known for over two decades, there are very limited data on gene variants conferring risk or protection for OSA. This is likely the result of underpowered studies and GENETIC HETEROGENEITY. There are multiple pathways to OSA. Obesity is a major risk factor, as are craniofacial dimensions. The relative risk of these different risk factors varies by ethnic group. There are also neuronal mechanisms and other physiological risk factors. This proposal seeks to directly address the issue of genetic heterogeneity using a very large sample of patients and state-of- the-art analysis techniques. Towards this end, we have assembled by far the largest sample of well characterized and genotyped patients with OSA. This is the result of collaboration with key sites in the eMERGE Network [Geisinger, Vanderbilt, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern], Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania. We propose to carry out a robust genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using an electronic health record (EHR) derived case definition and quantitative trait analysis of OSA severity. We will use novel machine learning approaches to specifically address genetic heterogeneity. The GWAS approach will be complimented by a PheWAS strategy as another approach to identifying common variants and related clinical phenotypes. Specifically, we will look for variants that associate with OSA and other clinical diagnoses in the EHR. It is likely that gene variants for OSA will have pleiotropic effects. Gene variants identified from GWAS and/or PheWAS will be further assessed. First, we will use available whole exome sequencing data to see if there are relevant rare variants in these genes, as well as to perform exploratory discovery analyses to look for novel rare variation. The functional role of the genes identified will be studied by functional network analysis. Finally, we will assess associations with quantitative data on intermediate traits identified by high throughput craniofacial and intra-oral photography. These data are currently available within the Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium (SAGIC). Future directions will assess the function of the genes identified in model systems and the clinical utility of utilizing variants as part of risk stratification for OSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with multiple adverse consequences. It is known that OSA has a genetic basis, but to date no convincing gene variants have been identified. This study uses state of the art approaches to identifying relevant genes based on a very large sample of patients with OSA obtained from multiple institutions in the United States. It is by far the largest study ever proposed for identifying genes for this common sleep disorder.",Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea,9478321,R01HL134015,"['Affect ', '

"Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Over the past 10 years human genetics studies made unprecedented numbers of discoveries relating genome variation to common diseases. While it is unquestionably true that we have learned substantially from the discoveries made to date, we must also acknowledge that with respect to the identification and characterization of the genome variation affecting risk of common human diseases - those accounting for the overwhelming majority of public health care expenditures - our discoveries have not generated nearly the knowledge of disease etiology that we would have expected given the sheer number of these discoveries. The combination of these observations coupled with the dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing is driving the case for moving to whole genome sequencing studies for common disease. We have focused our application on three critical challenges for methods development and analysis of whole genome sequence data. While there has been substantial progress in methods development for analysis of exome sequencing, with gene-based tests that are relatively robust to the direction of effects of rare coding variants as well as the proportionof the gene's rare variants contributing to phenotype, it is clear that methods integrating the analysis of common and rare variation as well as functional genomics data will be essential for appropriate analysis of whole genome sequence data. Thus, we propose in Specific Aim 1 to develop novel methods, software and analysis pipelines for integrated analysis of common and rare variants for the analysis of whole genome sequence on 50,000- 100,000 individuals for any given common disease, and in Specific Aim 2 to develop and apply novel approaches for prioritizing results from these large-scale sequencing studies using BioVU, the 200,000 member biobank at Vanderbilt that is associated with 30 years of high quality electronic health records, and in Specific Aim 3 to develop queriable results databases and a comprehensive web portal to serve results of our studies on the sequence data for both the internal sequencing community and for the broader scientific community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies are being carried out to understand the genetic architecture of human complex diseases. It remains challenging to decipher the genetic mechanisms of disease etiology. In this application we aim to develop a suite of statistical and computational methods to identify genes and variants associated with complex disease and use BioVU, a DNA BioBank linked to electronic health records, to validate and investigate genetic architecture of multiple complex diseases.","Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases",9483341,U01HG009086,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' health-care expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Genome ', ' Government ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Generations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' pleiotropism ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' success ', ' expectation ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' gene testing ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' functional genomics ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Data ', ' Large-Scale Sequencing ', ' Validation ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' NHGRI ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' disease phenotype ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' cost ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Coupled ', ' human disease ', ' public health relevance ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' exome-seq ', ' exome sequencing ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' Genetic study ', ' internet portal ', ' web portal ', ' human genomics ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' whole genome ', ' genomic data ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' genomic science ', ' genome sciences ', ' genetic architecture ', ' ']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,1037745,0.08926021278842002
"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches. Computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data produced for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers and genetic disorders. The proposed studies aim to address new challenges arising from the latest sequencing data and to develop faster and more accurate solutions to existing applications. The success of this proposal is likely to unlock the full power of recent sequencing technologies in disease studies and will dramatically reduce the cost of data analyses.",Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data,9498252,R01HG010040,"['Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Maps ', ' Modernization ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Running ', ' Seeds ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Genetic ', ' light weight ', ' lightweight ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' high throughput analysis ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' computerized data processing ', ' data processing ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Large-Scale Sequencing ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' deep sequencing ', ' cost ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Advanced Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' nano pore ', ' nanopore ', ' mammalian genome ', ' user-friendly ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' open source ', ' genome analysis ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' whole genome ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genetic condition ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2018,158992,0.03843626670350099
"PROMOTERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand the combinatorial rules that govern the interactions between transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Through these rules, combinations of TFBS specify an enormous diversity of gene expression patterns. Normal growth and development depends on the tight control of TFBS over levels of gene expression in both time and space, and aberrant regulation of gene expression underlies many genetic diseases. Although much progress has been made identifying TFBS, and the transcription factors (TFs) that bind to them, much less is known about how TFBS interact with each other to generate specific patterns of gene expression. In particular we lack an understanding of how specificity is achieved in large genomes where the cell must distinguish between ""true"" cis-regulatory elements and thousands of similar, but non-functional sequences. The proposal addresses this problem through experiments designed to unravel the mechanisms that govern cis-regulatory element specificity. Large libraries of simplified synthetic promoters will be constructed and assayed for expression, TF occupancy, and chromatin state. The data from these libraries will be analyzed with a thermodynamic model that describes the physical interactions between TFBS, TFs, RNA polymerase, and other elements that determine cis- regulatory activity. The models we produce from synthetic promoters will be explicitly tested on genomic promoters. The three aims of the proposal are organized around three different sources of information that determine specificity. In Aim1 we test the hypothesis that functional TFBS are specified by their interactions with other nearby TFBS. In Aim2 we explore the extent to which local sequence features besides TFBS help specify functional cis-regulatory elements. Finally, in Aim3 we will test the extent to which the chromosomal position and chromatin state of cis-regulatory elements influence the interactions between TFBS that govern their activity. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will result in a quantitative and molecular understanding of the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation. Such an understanding is necessary to empower biomedical applications, such as stem cell engineering, that are based on manipulating gene expression patterns. The results produced from this proposal will also help guide the annotation of the large regions of non-coding DNA in the genome that specify gene expression patterns. Finally, a clear understanding of TFBS interactions will help the identification and interpretation of disease causing genetic variants that affect cis-regulation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In addition to serving as a ""parts list"" of genes, the genome also encodes information that controls precisely where, when, and to what levels genes are produced (expressed). Strict control of gene expression is critical for normal growth and development, and aberrant gene expression underlies many genetic diseases, including cancer. Successful completion of the experiments in this proposal will illuminate the processes through which information in the genome controls precise patterns of gene expression, and will help us interpret disease causing genetic variants that alter normal patterns of gene expression.",PROMOTERS,9490337,R01GM092910,"['Affect ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Elements ', ' Explosion ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase ', ' RNA Polymerases ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases ', ' Specificity ', ' Stem cells ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Testing ', ' Thermodynamics ', ' Thermodynamic ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Measures ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Funding ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' cellular engineering ', ' cell engineering ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Chromosome Positioning ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Collection ', ' To specify ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' combinatorial ', ' public health relevance ', ' gDNA ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' genomic editing ', ' genome editing ', ' synthetic genomics ', ' chromosome location ', ' chromosomal position ', ' chromosomal location ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genetic condition ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' ']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,397299,0.03373204738570703
"Functional characterization of genetic and post-transcriptional variation using machine learning methods The goal of this research proposal is to develop new in-silico approaches for accurate functional annotation of genetic and post-transcriptional variants. The rapid growth of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and high- throughput -omics data have brought us one step closer towards mechanistic understanding of the complex genetic disease, such as cancer, neurological disorders, diabetes, and others at the molecular level. In particular, these data revealed that complex diseases commonly manifest changes at the genetic and post- transcriptional levels. Bot of these types of changes often affect structure and function of the corresponding genes and their products. Understanding the functional implications of the genetic and post-transcriptional variation is an important task as it can provide critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. Here, we propose to leverage novel machine learning paradigms to design computational methods for predicting the effect of genetic and alternative splicing variants on the macromolecular interactions. Macromolecular interactions underlie many cellular functions in a healthy organism. The disease-induced changes in the genes, such as single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and alternative splicing variations (ASVs) have been recently reported to cause the protein-protein interaction network rewiring. Unfortunately, the experimental high-throughput techniques that characterize the large-scale effects of SNVs or ASVs on PPIs are expensive, time-consuming, and far from being comprehensive. The current in-silico methods either suffer from the limited applicability, or are less accurate when compared with the experimental methods. To overcome these challenges, we will use two recent machine learning paradigms, learning under privileged information (LUPI) and semi-supervised learning. If successful, we expect for the proposed methods to provide the critical advancement in the two main challenges of the current computational approaches, the limited coverage and lower than the experimental accuracy. The methods will be freely available to the community as the stand-alone tools as well as web- servers. The goal of this proposal is to build computational tools that discover the links  between the disease-associated mutations as well as alternatively spliced protein isoforms  and the protein-protein interactions mediated by the disease proteins. The tools use advanced  machine learning methods to find such links in a fast and inexpensive way. These tools  will be useful in elucidating the molecular mechanisms implicated in the complex genetic disorders.",Functional characterization of genetic and post-transcriptional variation using machine learning methods,9601437,R21LM012772,"['Affect ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Proposals ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Work ', ' forest ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' One-Step dentin bonding system ', ' One Step ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Isoforms ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Data ', ' Homology Modeling ', ' Mutate ', ' RNA-Protein Interaction ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Molecular ', ' Genetic Annotation ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' rapid growth ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' transcriptomics ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' gene product ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genetic condition ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' human interactome ', ' ']",NLM,WORCESTER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R21,2018,159669,0.0676275898151965
"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design Our Vision: We propose DeepLink, a versatile data translator that integrate multi-scale, heterogeneous, and multi-source biomedical and clinical data. The primary goal of DeepLink is to enable meaningful bidirectional translation between clinical and molecular science by closing the interoperability gap between models and knowledge at different scales. The translator will enhance clinical science with molecular insights from basic and translational research (e.g. genetic variants, protein interactions, pathway functions, and cellular organization), and enable the molecular sciences by connecting biological discoveries with their pathophysiological consequences (e.g. diseases, signs and symptoms, pharmacological effects, physiological systems). Fundamental differences in the language and semantics used to describe the models and knowledge between the clinical and molecular domains results in an interoperability gap. DeepLink will systematically and comprehensively close this gap. We will begin with the latest technology in semantic knowledge graphs to support an extensible architecture for dynamic data federation and knowledge harmonization. We will design a system for multi-scale model integration that is ontology-based and will combine model execution with prior, curated biomedical knowledge. Our design strategy will be iterative and participatory and anchored by 10 major milestones. In a series of demonstrations of DeepLink’s functions, we will address one of the major challenges facing translational science: reproducibility of biomedical research findings that are based on evolving molecular datasets. Reproducibility of analyses and replication of results are central to scientific advancement. Many landmark studies have used data that are constantly being updated, curated, and pared down over time. Our series of demonstrations projects are designed to prototype the technology required for a scalable and robust translator as well as the techniques we will use to close the interoperability gap for a specific use case. The demonstration project will, itself, will be a significant and novel contribution to science. DeepLink will be able to answer questions that are currently enigmatic. Examples include: - From clinicians: What is the comparative effectiveness of all the treatments for disease Y given a patient's genetic/metabolic/proteomic profile? What are the functional variants in cell type X that are associated with differential treatment outcomes? What metabolite perturbations in cell type Y are associated with different subtypes of disease X? - From basic science researchers: What is known about disease Y across all model organisms (even those not designed to model Y)? What are all the clinical phenotypes that result from a change in function in protein X? Which biological pathways are affected by a pathogenic variant of disease Y? What patient data are available to evaluate a molecularlyderived clinical hypothesis? Challenges and Our Approaches: DeepLink will close the interoperability gap that currently prohibits molecular discoveries from leading to clinical innovations. DeepLink will be technologically driven, addressing the challenges associated with large, heterogeneous, semantically ambiguous, continuously changing, partially overlapping, and contextually dependent data by using (1) scalable, distributed, and versioned graph stores; (2) semantic technologies such as ontologies and Linked Data; (3) network analysis quality control methods; (4) machine-learning focused data fusion methods; (5) context-aware text mining, entity recognition and relation extraction; (6) multi-scale knowledge discovery using patient and molecular data; and (7) presentation of actionable knowledge to clinicians and basic scientists via user-friendly interfaces.

"Biomedical Computing and Informatics Strategies for Infectious Disease Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important goal of infectious disease research is to develop genetic predictors of susceptibility. Our success in this endeavor will depend critically on the informatics methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic and genomic data. The goal of this research program is to develop, evaluate, distribute and support new and novel biomedical computing algorithms and open-source software for identifying combinations of genetic predictors of clinically important infectious disease outcomes. This application will target the growing body of rare genetic variants identified by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our clinical application will focus on the prediction of antiretroviral response in clinical trials for HIV/AIDS. We propose here a highly innovative Hierarchical Rare Variant Collapsing Machine (HRVCM) algorithm for identifying and collapsing combinations of rare variants across gene regions (AIM 1). We will then integrate these new collapsed HRVCM variables into our popular Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method that will assess them in combination with common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genome-wide association studies or GWAS (AIM 2). Our novel HRVCM-MDR approach will, for the first time, make it possible to assess non-additive interactions among sets of rare and common variants simultaneously in genetic studies of infectious diseases. We will apply these new and novel methods to approximately 13 million rare and common variants from nearly 3000 subjects that participated in an AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) study to evaluate risk for virologic failure with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens (AIM 3). Finally, we will release all methods as open source to the biomedical research community through our freely available MDR software package (AIM 4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this application is to develop innovative new computational methods for the genetic analysis of infectious diseases.

"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies SUMMARY Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. NARRATIVE The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,9702305,R01GM125639,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Crystallization ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Proteins ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Site-Directed Mutagenesis ', ' Targeted Modification ', ' Targeted DNA Modification ', ' Site-Specific Mutagenesis ', ' forest ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' mutant ', ' success ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Homology Modeling ', ' International ', ' Resolution ', ' Scheme ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' Population ', ' Coupling ', ' biological research ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' screening ', ' biophysical modeling ', ' biophysical model ', ' biophysical methods ', ' biophysical methodology ', ' biophysical approaches ', ' biophysical techniques ', ' Genetic study ', ' internet portal ', ' web portal ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' whole genome ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' human interactome ', ' ']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,99500,0.09885225456127447
"Center for Multi- and Trans-ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) will identify genomic variants relevant to health and disease by genome sequencing over 225,000 participants across a multitude of diseases. The GSP will also serve as a pilot for the Precision Medicine Initiative that aims to enroll and sequence more than a million people representative of U.S. ethnic diversity. Here, we propose a GSP analysis center focused on Multi- and Trans- ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases. There is a growing recognition of the substantial scientific advantages, as well as public health importance, of conducting biomedical research across ethnically diverse cohorts. We propose to develop scalable methods that incorporate ancestry to optimize medical genomic study design and improve power for uncovering the role of common and rare variants in disease. Achieving this goal requires expertise across diverse domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for complex disease mapping, and expertise in management of large-scale databases. Here, we have assembled a world-class team of medical and population geneticists, computer scientists, statisticians and clinicians, with leading expertise in the development of novel and scalable strategies for characterizing sequence variants and their role in disease. Importantly, our group has been at the forefront of development of resources, study designs and methods to enable genomic research in U.S. minority populations. Our project has three main objectives. First, we will develop an Automated Scalable Ancestry Pipeline (ASAP) for common disease mapping in diverse populations. ASAP will improve the computational efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods for ancestry inference and develop important extensions to linear mixed models (LMMs) and other mapping strategies leveraging local and global ancestry. We will also develop methods to refine phenotypes and identify common controls for disease studies and define endpoints. Secondly, we will develop tools and resources for trans- and multi-population rare variant discovery that incorporate patterns of local and sub-continental ancestry. We will also develop machine-learning tools for variant annotation that leverage ancestral information, patterns of sequence evolution, and protein structure in a unified framework. Furthermore, we will incorporate population-specific patterns of cellular phenotypes to improve functional prediction algorithms for non-coding and coding variants. Lastly, we will disseminate our results through web-based resource that empower the biomedical research community. We will augment existing resources including ClinGen by annotating and characterizing pathogenic variants across diverse populations.

"Computational Methods to Characterize Alternative Splicing from Massive Collections of RNA-seq Data SUMMARY Alternative splicing (AS) is a gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human biology and disease. High throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) is making it possible to survey the expressed genes and their alternative splicing variations in a wide variety of cellular conditions. However, the short reads are challenging to analyze, demanding highly sophisticated computational methods that can extract meaningful AS information efficiently, accurately, and in a comprehensive way. While there has been great progress so far, current methods based on assembling the short reads into transcript annotations have reached a plateau. We propose two innovations that can help overcome the limits. The first is one-step simultaneous analyses of multiple samples in an RNA-seq collection, in contrast with the current two-step approach that analyzes each sample separately and then merges the results. The second is to create and interrogate assembly-free representations of AS. The project will design a suite of tools that will leverage the latent information in large collections of samples and from heterogeneous data types to build complete and accurate AS signatures of tissues and cell types, and to elucidate the regulatory circuitry of AS and its functional implications. Aim 1 will develop a high- performance multi-sample transcript assembly tool, combining subexon graph representations of genes and AS variations, statistical methods for improved feature detection, and search space reduction techniques for efficient sample processing. Aim 2 will build highly efficient and accurate feature selection tools to detect and characterize assembly-free AS variations (subexons and introns), simultaneously from collections of RNA-seq samples. It will combine novel regularized programs with complex models of intronic `noise' and other RNA-seq confounders, and enable analyses of differential splicing and to identify individual and group-specific variations. Lastly, Aim 3 will develop a system to comprehensively model the regulatory and functional circuitry of AS and the effects of mutations, starting from deep learning models of sequences and alignments and integrating expression, sequence, epigenetic and mutation data across tissues, cell types and conditions. We will rigorously test and evaluate all tools in simulations and on large public data sets, as well as on thyroid and head and neck cancer data provided by our collaborators, and we will experimentally validate random subsets of predictions with capillary electrophoresis and qRT-PCR. Collectively, the concepts, methods and tools will establish a new framework for analyzing RNA-seq data that can efficiently tackle the `big data' challenges, leading to more complete discovery and annotation of AS structure and function in human health and disease.   NARRATIVE Alternative splicing is a fundamental gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human physiology and disease. Next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is making it possible to characterize alternative splicing in great detail, however, current bioinformatics analysis tools miss important variations.

"RegulomeDB: A Resource for the Human Regulome PROJECT SUMMARY The Human RegulomeDB project provides an essential resource that facilitates medical research and exploratory investigations of gene regulation. The majority of sequence variation identified in genome sequencing projects and disease association studies (GWAS) lie within the 98% of the human genome that is non-exomic. RegulomeDB is a unique web accessible resource that provides integrated knowledge of the wealth of existing information concerning regulatory elements that lie within non-exomic regions. The unique feature of this resource is its ability to comprehensively annotate, integrate and display the experimentally defined functional and biochemical regulatory elements of the human genome. Information generated from individual laboratories and consortia concerning potential regulatory regions such as that affecting gene expression, transcription factor binding, chromatin modification and DNA methylation will be collected from the literature, and integrated into a common database and displayed at nucleotide resolution. The information can be readily accessed via a web accessible interface and related to sequence variations identified from large scale projects (e.g. db SNPs, 1000 genome project, GWAS studies). Researchers will be able to compare variants identified from personal genomes and large scale sequencing projects as well as GWAS studies to the wealth of information in RegulomeDB, and thereby rapidly gain knowledge of non-exomic information.

"Genetic Factors in Keratoconus DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to develop techniques for use in the 'early' detection of keratoconus (KC) and identify genetic variants that contribute to is development. KC is a complex genetic eye disorder and a leading cause of corneal transplantation in the young, with approximately 300,000 affected individuals in the US. Undiagnosed, subclinical KC is one of the major causes for complications of LASIK (Laser-in-situ- Keratomilieusis) surgery, commonly performed for vision correction. In the past two decades we have made major improvements to the early diagnosis of KC and have also made significant contributions to the delineation of major genetic determinants of KC through genome wide linkage studies (GWLS), fine mapping, and genome wide association studies (GWAS). In this proposal, we intend to follow up on these studies using new powerful approaches to achieve the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will combine corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Pentacam HR Scheimpflug Tomography (PST), new technologies that measure both the anterior and posterior surface of the cornea, with videokeratography (VK), a method which revolutionized KC diagnosis, to characterize criteria and to improve the diagnosis of subclinical KC. In Aim 2, to identify additional KC genes, we will perform a 2.5 million SNP GWAS, with an additional 6,000 SNPs, to fine- map already identified genes. We will confirm these results in a separate cohort of KC patients. For this two- stage GWAS design we are assembling the largest group of KC patients described to date: 2000 KC patients in total, 1,000 for the GWAS discovery stage and 1,000 for the confirmation stage. The controls for GWAS discovery will come from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 3300) and for confirmation will come from 400 subjects with VK, PST, and OCT measurements under Aim 1 and 600 ""convenience controls"" from the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study. In our current state of knowledge, the most cost-effective approach to increase the number of identified KC genes is to proceed with the expanded GWAS proposed herein. In Aim 3, we will test the impact of the genes identified in Aim 2 on the 'early' subclinical phenotypes identified through the use o VK, PST and OCT measures in Aim 1. Lastly, for the second part of Aim 3, we will investigate the potential function of KC variants by testing their ability to influence gene structure, expression and function in corneal cell models, including iPS cells derived from corneal keratocytes developed by our research team. The results of these studies will help advance our understanding of the genetic susceptibility to KC and may result in novel treatment options to slow the progression of the disease.

"Linking human enhancers to predictive models of mRNA abundance PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A central challenge in understanding the genetic origins of disease is the inability to isolate which regions of the genome are functionally responsible for the aberrant expression of genes. To date, nearly 85% of identified disease-causing mutations lie within protein-coding exons (i.e. the “exome”), which comprises 2% of the human genome. Yet an estimated 50-75% of Mendelian disorders, and an even greater proportion of non-Mendelian (i.e. polygenic) diseases, have unexplained genetic etiologies which are suspected to involve genetic variants in the remaining 98% of the human non-coding genome. Over the past 5 years, new genome-scale technologies have uncovered the existence of ~400,000 enhancer-like regions. Mutations in these regions are suspected to be a major source of the misregulation of gene expression levels, which can in turn manifest in disease. Nevertheless, the vast majority of these regions have never been directly tested for their ability to activate transcription, nor have they been definitively linked to the regulation of target genes. The K99 training phase of this award entails the development of a new generation of massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) technologies that can interrogate the functional activity of 10,000-100,000 enhancers with high precision and reproducibility, an order of magnitude more than is currently possible (Aim 1). Coordinated with this effort will be the quantitative modeling of biological determinants that are predictive of enhancer activity (Aim 2). Complementing Aims 1 and 2 is the development of models designed to infer enhancer-promoter regulatory interactions. Towards this goal, self-attentive models, derived from the field of computational linguistics, will be trained to learn how the epigenetic marks and transcription factor binding events associated with distal enhancers contribute to gene expression levels in a diversity of cell types (Aim 3). As this work transitions into the R00 independent phase of the award, deep convolutional neural networks will be trained to learn how underlying DNA sequences encode epigenetic and transcription factor binding information. This would thereby generate a mathematical function which links DNA sequence directly to gene expression levels, which would help to predict how specific genetic variants in distal enhancers might perturb the mRNA levels of target genes. These predictions will help to inform—at single nucleotide resolution—which genetic variants identified by genome-wide association studies are causally linked to disease (Aim 4). Collectively, these aims will give insight into the cis-regulatory logic encoded in DNA that specifies mRNA abundance. The methods developed herein will lay a quantitative framework with which to evaluate enhancer function, prioritize which genetic variants are likely to be associated with disease, and shed light onto the elusive functions of the non-coding regions of the human genome. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goals of this project are to develop a technology that can measure the activity of >10,000 enhancers in parallel, and to devise quantitative models that describe the impact of enhancers on gene expression levels. Achieving these goals will give insight into the cis-regulatory logic encoded in DNA that specifies mRNA abundance. We anticipate that these methods will shed light upon the elusive functions of non-coding regions in the human genome, and help to dissect the molecular origins of diverse genetic diseases.",Linking

"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs.

"Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation How do changes in DNA sequence impact organismal properties? This is a central question of modern  biology, and insights into it can help us understand, among other things, why patients respond  differently to the same treatment, or why some species exhibit behavioral properties not seen in  other species. A major hurdle in solving this ‘genotype-to-phenotype’ problem is our poor knowledge  of gene regulatory mechanisms underlying phenotypes and cellular processes, and how those  mechanisms are encoded in DNA. It also leads to severe difficulties in prioritizing  phenotype-linked non-coding variants (polymorphisms) for further investigation. Driven by these  challenges, my lab seeks to develop quantitative frameworks for describing and  discovering transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We have made significant progress towards this  goal in two main directions: (1) We have developed detailed biophysical models of the  cis-regulatory encoding of gene expression. Using these models we have shown how the regulatory  function of transcription factor (TF) binding sites depends on their sequence and DNA shape, as  well as their ‘trans-context’, e.g., cellular concentrations of regulators, and  ‘cis-context’, e.g., proximity to other TF binding sites and chromatin states. (2) We have  devised statistical models to discover TF-gene interactions from transcriptomic data, as well as  other types of ‘omics’ data if available. Working closely with biologists, we have applied these  models to understand phenotypes such as cytotoxic drug response in cell lines, behavioral response  to social encounters, and embryonic development. Building on the strong foundations of our  past work, I propose to establish a research program that studies transcriptional regulation  holistically at the cis- and trans- levels. Our new pursuits will include: (1) use of our  computational, sequence-level models to describe two data-rich mammalian regulatory programs, an  experimental collaboration to dissect the cis-regulatory logic of a key inflammation gene using  massively parallel reporter assays, and major advances in our modeling techniques; (2) new  machine learning methods for reconstructing networks of TF-gene interactions that explain  phenotypic differences, integration of cis- and trans-regulatory evidence from multi-omics  data, and collaborations to apply these methods in cancer pharmacogenomics and behavioral  neurogenomics; (3) a new probabilistic framework to combine traditional statistical scores of a  non-coding variant with quantitative predictions of its regulatory impact based on the  above-mentioned techniques. Explorations of new forms of synergy among these related goals of  network reconstruction, cis-regulatory sequence modeling and variant interpretation will be woven  throughout our research program. The proposed work will answer fundamental questions about molecular mechanisms underlying  phenotypic differences between individuals, such as why different patients respond differently to  the same drug. We will develop new computational methods for discovery of such mechanisms from a  variety of genomics data sets. We will work closely with experimental biologists and use our tools  to study important biological topics including cancer drug response, inflammation, and effect of  estrogen on breast cancer.","Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation",9699641,R35GM131819,"['Antineoplastic Agents ', ' anticancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Chromatin ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Inflammation ', ' Logic ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' polymorphism ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Research ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Cytotoxic agent ', ' Cytotoxic drug ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' gene interaction ', ' synergism ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Data ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' reconstruction ', ' transcriptomics ', ' biophysical model ', ' biophysical modeling ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' neurogenomics ', ' neuro-genomics ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' multiple omic data ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R35,2019,356979,0.08513007555837135
"Modeling gene expression in yeast using large degenerate libraries PROJECT SUMMARY Short sequence elements in DNA and RNA determine the levels and composition of mRNAs and proteins, making it critical that we can accurately model how any given sequence will affect transcription, splicing or translation. Such models of cis-regulation will fill in gaps in our knowledge of these core gene expression processes. Additionally, as large numbers of human genomes are sequenced, the ability to predict the effects of sequence variation on the ultimate levels of proteins will be integral to the interpretation of variation in regulatory sequences. Similarly, the construction of metabolic pathways with defined levels of expression and the engineering of synthetic gene networks require accurate knowledge of how regulatory sequences affect expression. This application seeks to use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a test case for learning how any short regulatory sequence affects protein levels. A predictive model will be trained on a set of libraries two orders of magnitude more complex than have been characterized to date. Libraries will be generated of a growth reporter gene with a million random sequences of 50 nucleotides that comprise either a DNA element that regulates transcription or an RNA element that regulates splicing or translation. The libraries will be transformed into yeast, and the yeast will be placed under selection such that they grow according to the ability of each random sequence to contribute to protein expression. A convolution neural network approach will be used to learn the relationship between these “fitness” phenotypes and their associated genotypes. Although yeast is a single-celled eukaryote, it has been the source of most of the original findings on gene expression, and these findings form the basis for much of our knowledge of more complex eukaryotes. Furthermore, the short sequences in yeast that comprise the DNA- and RNA-binding sites of regulatory proteins tend to be comparable in size to those of other organisms. Yeast is used often in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, and the work proposed here will result in novel tools for quantitatively controlling its gene expression. Initial results with a library of 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) indicate that we can construct a model to account for a large fraction of the observed variability in expression, and that the model extends to native sequence elements. The model allowed us to forward engineer 5' UTRs to have increased activity. Specific aims of this application are to assess the effects of random sequences targeted to upstream regulatory elements, core promoter elements, 5' UTRs, introns and 3' UTRs; to learn predictive and interpretable models using convolutional neural networks and to identify novel functional cis-regulatory elements; and to validate our models on native sequences and combinatorial libraries, and by engineering synthetic sequence elements with user-specified properties. In sum, the proposal seeks to construct a comprehensive and predictive model of regulatory sequence–function relationships for a well-studied single- celled eukaryote, providing a basis for similar studies on other organisms.

"Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Over the past 10 years human genetics studies made unprecedented numbers of discoveries relating genome variation to common diseases. While it is unquestionably true that we have learned substantially from the discoveries made to date, we must also acknowledge that with respect to the identification and characterization of the genome variation affecting risk of common human diseases - those accounting for the overwhelming majority of public health care expenditures - our discoveries have not generated nearly the knowledge of disease etiology that we would have expected given the sheer number of these discoveries. The combination of these observations coupled with the dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing is driving the case for moving to whole genome sequencing studies for common disease. We have focused our application on three critical challenges for methods development and analysis of whole genome sequence data. While there has been substantial progress in methods development for analysis of exome sequencing, with gene-based tests that are relatively robust to the direction of effects of rare coding variants as well as the proportionof the gene's rare variants contributing to phenotype, it is clear that methods integrating the analysis of common and rare variation as well as functional genomics data will be essential for appropriate analysis of whole genome sequence data. Thus, we propose in Specific Aim 1 to develop novel methods, software and analysis pipelines for integrated analysis of common and rare variants for the analysis of whole genome sequence on 50,000- 100,000 individuals for any given common disease, and in Specific Aim 2 to develop and apply novel approaches for prioritizing results from these large-scale sequencing studies using BioVU, the 200,000 member biobank at Vanderbilt that is associated with 30 years of high quality electronic health records, and in Specific Aim 3 to develop queriable results databases and a comprehensive web portal to serve results of our studies on the sequence data for both the internal sequencing community and for the broader scientific community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies are being carried out to understand the genetic architecture of human complex diseases. It remains challenging to decipher the genetic mechanisms of disease etiology. In this application we aim to develop a suite of statistical and computational methods to identify genes and variants associated with complex disease and use BioVU, a DNA BioBank linked to electronic health records, to validate and investigate genetic architecture of multiple complex diseases.","Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases",9693289,U01HG009086,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Communities ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Government ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Generations ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' pleiotropism ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' success ', ' expectation ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' gene testing ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' functional genomics ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Data ', ' Large-Scale Sequencing ', ' Validation ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' NHGRI ', ' disease phenotype ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' cost ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Coupled ', ' human disease ', ' public health relevance ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' Genetic study ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' human genomics ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' genome sciences ', ' genomic science ', ' genetic architecture ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' ']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,994410,0.08926021278842002
"Interrogating regulatory variants by multiplexed genome editing A major result from recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) is that the majority of genetic variants driving common human diseases lie in regulatory, rather than protein-coding, regions. Massive efforts to map epigenomic features such as localization of histone modifications (HMs) and transcription factors (TFs) have paved the way toward understanding the regulatory genome. However, dissecting the impact of an individual non-coding variant remains an unsolved challenge.  A variety of computational methods have been proposed, such as quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies and machine learning techniques. However, these methods still do not provide conclusive information about causality of any specific non-coding mutation and lack gold-standard experimental results for evaluation. Several techniques are used to experimentally test the impact of individual regulatory variants. For example, massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) synthesize thousands of oligonucleotides encoding mutated versions of putative regulatory elements placed in plasmids upstream of reporter genes. However, a major limitation is that tested sequences are outside of their endogenous chromosomal locus, and hence do not necessarily provide physiological relevance.  CRISPR enables targeted editing of genomic DNA. Indeed, CRISPR is widely used, but studies of individual point mutations have been primarily on a small scale and are usually limited to a handful of variants or to a single gene. The major throughput challenge in studying a specific variant using genome editing is in tying genotype to phenotype. Introducing individual mutations exhibits low efficiency, and thus there is a need for enrichment of the genotype or phenotype of interest prior to assessing the impact of a mutation on a phenotype, such as gene expression. Current enrichment methods either disrupt the physiological context or are low throughput. Recent efforts overcame these challenges using pooled editing to analyze thousands of mutations simultaneously, but were limited to variants in protein coding regions.  This proposal aims to develop a novel technique merging multiplexed genome editing of putative regulatory variants followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to simultaneously measure the impact of hundreds of non-coding variants on regulatory potential in their native genomic context. The key insight of the proposed approach is that mutations impacting epigenomic features can be measured both in genomic DNA and in phenotypic readouts such as ChIP-seq of TFs or HMs, avoiding the need for a selection step to connect genotypes with phenotypes. ​Aim 1 develops the pooled editing technique on a pilot set of previously validated regulatory variants. ​Aim 2 scales this approach to interrogate thousands of mutations at once. ​Aim 3 integrates experimental predictions with state of the art machine learning methods to evaluate and optimize computational methods for regulatory variant effect prediction. Recent studies have demonstrated that the majority of genetic changes in the population contributing to common human diseases, such as schizophrenia, heart disease, and diabetes, lie in regions of the genome that do not code for proteins, but rather regulate the expression of genes. Despite massive efforts to map regulatory regions across dozens of human cell types, it is still difficult to predict the effect of an individual non-coding mutation. This project develops a high-throughput genome editing technique to simultaneously measure the impact of hundreds of non-coding mutations on regulatory potential in their native genomic context, with the ultimate goal of interpreting genetic changes leading to human disease.",Interrogating regulatory variants by multiplexed genome editing,9761568,R21HG010070,"['Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' oligos ', ' Oligo ', ' Oligonucleotides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasmids ', ' Proteins ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Measures ', ' Protein Coding Region ', ' ORFs ', ' Open Reading Frames ', ' Enhancers ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Point Mutation ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Reporter Genes ', ' Evaluation ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' novel ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Cell Fraction ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Allelic Imbalance ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Mutate ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' Malignant Epithelial Cell ', ' Carcinoma Cell ', ' Molecular ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' epigenomics ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' human disease ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' gDNA ', ' genome editing ', ' genomic editing ', ' HepG2 ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' Hep G2 ', ' HNF4A gene ', ' Transcription Factor 14, Hepatic Nuclear Factor ', ' TCF14 ', ' Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor, 4 ', ' Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4-Alpha ', ' HNF4A ', ' HNF4-Alpha ', ' HNF4 ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' ']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2019,236250,0.08331939268567216

"Gene expression and regulation in C. elegans with single cell resolution Abstract The nematode C. elegans is unique among model organisms in having a defined lineage and known connections for all its 302 neurons. The genome sequence was completed more than 20 years ago, but knowing which genes in the genome are used in exactly which cells and what transcription factors are controlling that expression remains a major challenge. We have successfully applied single cell- (sc-)RNA-seq methods to one larval stage and three embryonic stages to measure the RNA content of individual cells across the whole animal. We also have preliminary data that indicates that we can assay chromatin accessibility at the single cell level using the assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq). We now propose to collect both sc-RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data at multiple stages to determine the gene expression patterns of each cell in the worm and the active regulatory sequence throughout the entire life cycle of C. elegans. In turn we will use the combined data sets along with chromatin- immunoprecipitation- (ChIP-) seq data to impute what transcription factors are controlling expression of each gene in the genome in every cell and what regulatory sequences these transcription factors recognize. The results will provide a valuable resource to scientists studying the worm and addresses a major outstanding question in the molecular biology of development. In addition, these data sets, from an animal with a “ground truth” should serve as a platform for methods development in the single cell field.

"Deep learning methods to predict the function of genetic variants in orofacial clefts Project Summary  Orofacial clefts (OFCs) comprise a significant fraction of human birth defects in all populations (ranging between 1/500 to 1/2500 live births) and represent a major public health challenge. Individuals born with OFCs require surgical, nutritional, dental, speech, medical and behavioral interventions, imposing a substantial economic and personal burden. There has been convincing evidence that non-syndromic OFCs represent human complex disorders with a multifactorial etiology including genetic risk factors, environmental exposures, and their complex interactions. So far, there have been ~10 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted for non-syndromic CL/P (NSCL/P) and >15 genomic loci reported with compelling statistical support, including genes such as IRF6, PAX7, and ABCA4 and the 8q24 locus. In addition, next-generation sequencing (NGS) as well as exome array have been conducted with extra depth of genotyping that enable detection of rare variants associated with OFCs. However, gaps exist in how to interpret these variants and how to identify novel variants from the large volume of data, with high expectations for new methods and new models for “second- analysis” of the genome-wide data. In this proposal, we propose two complementary aims to carry out deep and second-analysis of genome-wide data for OFCs. In Aim 1, we propose a deep learning method to build in silico models that can predict the effect of genetic variants in the context of rich craniofacial epigenomic features. With substantial fine map of sequence patterns, ad hoc motifs will be revealed and variants that disturb these motifs will provide mechanistic insights on OFCs. In Aim 2, we shift our focus to the gene level and propose a network assisted method to discover sensibly combined genes in spatial and temporal points that are critical to orofacial development. We target on all forms of OFCs, with particular interest in NSCL/P. To guarantee the success of this proposal, we form a multi-disciplinary team and local computational infrastructure equipped with GPUs for the implementation of both aims. Our aims are non-overlapping; rather, they are integrated and strongly focused on our fundamental question of interest: how genetic variants function to cause OFCs. The successful completion of our proposal will lead to deep understanding of genetic components in OFCs. Project Narrative Orofacial clefts (OFCs) comprise a significant fraction of human birth defects in all populations and represent a major public health challenge. Substantial progress has been made to identify genes and variants for OFCs through recent genome-wide association studies and next- generation sequencing projects.

"Mosaicism in focal cortical dysplasias spectrum seen in neuropsychiatric disease Abstract/Summary  Our parent grant U01-MH108898 entitled “Mosaicism in focal cortical dysplasias spectrum seen in neuropsychiatric disease” has a focus on understanding the mechanisms of dysplasia of the cerebral cortex, and the contribution of brain somatic mosaicism to this process. Mosaicism is the occurrence of two (or more) genomes in an individual who is derived from a single zygote. Members of the NIMH-supported Brain Somatic Mosaicism Network (BSMN) are characterizing mosaic variation in other neuropsychiatric disorders with a common goal of assessing the role of somatic mosaic variation across diseases including BPD, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, Tourette syndrome, and dysplasias. We propose three capstone projects to map the full spectrum of somatic variation in human brain and characterize the contributions of mosaic variants to neuropsychiatric disease risk. These capstones can advance the mission of the BSMN, to both achieve greater power of discovery of somatic mutations by combining and harmonizing deep coverage whole genome sequencing data that have been generated across nodes, as well as placing the variants identified through the study of brain somatic mosaicism (BSM) in the context of neurodevelopment and disease. To integrate this multi- dimensional data from the BSMN, as well as other consortia, administrative supplements are requested to continue, in the final two years of the award, three capstone projects, as well as to contribute to the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) and data analytic core (DAC). We expect these Capstone Projects to increase the profile of the BSMN by creating an unprecedented data resource of somatic mosaicism variants across development and diseases widely available to the scientific community. The enhanced power provided by the combined analyses of the BSMN will provide foundational knowledge that will guide future work, and lead to new insight into brain somatic mosaicism. The specific aims are (1) for Capstone 2, to assess the somatic mutational landscape in the human brain, by an unprecedented, comprehensive mapping of brain mosaicism in a single person; (2) for Capstone 3, to exploit deeply sequenced bulk short-read WGS to detect somatic structural variation by refining and employing a novel machine-learning classifier approach named CHONK that was developed in our lab. Project Narrative This project assesses the natural mosaic variation in the human brain using unprecedented depth on comprehensive sampling to analyze the mosaicism within a single individual. We will further extend our analysis of mosaic variation to structural variants by employing a novel, machine-learning based, classifier. 1",Mosaicism in focal cortical dysplasias spectrum seen in neuropsychiatric disease,9905189,U01MH108898,"['Award ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain Mapping ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maps ', ' Mission ', ' mosaic disorders ', ' Mosaicism ', ' Names ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Single Person ', ' Maritally Unattached ', ' Unmarried person ', ' Time ', ' tic de Guinon ', ' maladie des tics ', "" Tourette's Syndrome "", "" Tourette's Disorder "", "" Tourette's Disease "", "" Tourette's "", ' Tourette Syndrome ', ' Tic Disorder, Combined Vocal and Multiple Motor ', "" Guinon's disease "", "" Gilles de la Tourette's Disease "", ' Gilles de la Tourette syndrome ', ' Work ', ' Fertilized Ovum ', ' Fertilized Egg ', ' zygote ', ' base ', ' Lateral ', ' Dorsal ', ' Medial ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Microglia ', ' perivascular glial cell ', ' microgliocyte ', ' microglial cell ', ' mesoglia ', ' gitter cell ', ' Hortega cell ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' Dysplasia ', ' dyscrasia ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Cortical Dysplasia ', ' brain tissue ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Sampling ', ' genome sequencing ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' parent grant ', ' Data Analytics ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' data resource ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2019,248888,0.09289206131879527
"Biomedical Data Translator Technical Feasibility Assessment and Architecture Design Our Vision: We propose DeepLink, a versatile data translator that integrate multi-scale, heterogeneous, and multi-source biomedical and clinical data. The primary goal of DeepLink is to enable meaningful bidirectional translation between clinical and molecular science by closing the interoperability gap between models and knowledge at different scales. The translator will enhance clinical science with molecular insights from basic and translational research (e.g. genetic variants, protein interactions, pathway functions, and cellular organization), and enable the molecular sciences by connecting biological discoveries with their pathophysiological consequences (e.g. diseases, signs and symptoms, pharmacological effects, physiological systems). Fundamental differences in the language and semantics used to describe the models and knowledge between the clinical and molecular domains results in an interoperability gap. DeepLink will systematically and comprehensively close this gap. We will begin with the latest technology in semantic knowledge graphs to support an extensible architecture for dynamic data federation and knowledge harmonization. We will design a system for multi-scale model integration that is ontology-based and will combine model execution with prior, curated biomedical knowledge. Our design strategy will be iterative and participatory and anchored by 10 major milestones. In a series of demonstrations of DeepLink’s functions, we will address one of the major challenges facing translational science: reproducibility of biomedical research findings that are based on evolving molecular datasets. Reproducibility of analyses and replication of results are central to scientific advancement. Many landmark studies have used data that are constantly being updated, curated, and pared down over time. Our series of demonstrations projects are designed to prototype the technology required for a scalable and robust translator as well as the techniques we will use to close the interoperability gap for a specific use case. The demonstration project will, itself, will be a significant and novel contribution to science. DeepLink will be able to answer questions that are currently enigmatic. Examples include: - From clinicians: What is the comparative effectiveness of all the treatments for disease Y given a patient's genetic/metabolic/proteomic profile? What are the functional variants in cell type X that are associated with differential treatment outcomes? What metabolite perturbations in cell type Y are associated with different subtypes of disease X? - From basic science researchers: What is known about disease Y across all model organisms (even those not designed to model Y)? What are all the clinical phenotypes that result from a change in function in protein X? Which biological pathways are affected by a pathogenic variant of disease Y? What patient data are available to evaluate a molecularlyderived clinical hypothesis? Challenges and Our Approaches: DeepLink will close the interoperability gap that currently prohibits molecular discoveries from leading to clinical innovations. DeepLink will be technologically driven, addressing the challenges associated with large, heterogeneous, semantically ambiguous, continuously changing, partially overlapping, and contextually dependent data by using (1) scalable, distributed, and versioned graph stores; (2) semantic technologies such as ontologies and Linked Data; (3) network analysis quality control methods; (4) machine-learning focused data fusion methods; (5) context-aware text mining, entity recognition and relation extraction; (6) multi-scale knowledge discovery using patient and molecular data; and (7) presentation of actionable knowledge to clinicians and basic scientists via user-friendly interfaces.

"HIV-1 Tat genetic variation impacts NeuroAIDS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 has demonstrated the ability to cause adverse neurological complications. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in improved survival, reduced viral loads, increased CD4 T- cell counts, reduced opportunistic infections, and has resulted in a decrease in the most severe form of HIV- associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), HIV-associated dementia (HAD). However, the overall prevalence of all forms of HAND has increased, potentially because HIV-1-infected individuals are living longer with persistent infection. In addition to activating an antiviral immne response within the CNS, the production of HIV-1 proteins leads to neurotoxicity through direct and indirect mechanisms. Of particular interest is the HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat, which in addition to driving viral transcription also functions as an extracellular neurotoxic protein, activator of astrocytes and microglial cells, and impacts the structure and function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Tat is released by infected monocytes, microglial cells, and astrocytes in addition to infected lymphocytes. Tat can be continually produced by HIV-1-infected cells located in the CNS despite the widespread use of HAART, demonstrating that neurologic vulnerability to this protein persists in the HAART era. In addition, mRNA levels for Tat are elevated in brain extracts from individuals with HAD. HIV-1 also displays extensive sequence variation with the quasispecies shaped by many host-specific and comorbidity pressures, while simultaneously maintaining functions that are critical to replication and infectivity as well as pathogenesis. Studies with respect to subtype B Tat genetic variation and HAND have demonstrated (i) Tat sequences from patients in the absence or presence of HAD showed clustering of sequences with respect to neurological impairment as well as tissue of origin, (ii) nonsynonymous versus synonymous mutation rates among brain-derived Tat sequences from patients with HAND were significantly greater than those isolated from patients without neurological disease, and (iii) variation at positions 74 and 100 were correlated to Tat sequences isolated from brain-derived sequences. Importantly, HIV-1 Tat derived from HAD patients has been associated with greater neuronal death. Together, these reports suggest that genetic diversity of HIV-1 Tat likely contributes to the establishment and severity of HAND. Given this, the hypothesis of this application is that patient-derived genetic variants of the HIV- protein Tat are specifically linked with neurologic impairment. To explore this hypothesis, the Specific Aims are to: (1) identify and characterize polymorphisms in HIV-1 Tat from patients with defined degrees of neurocognitive impairment; (2) examine the structural impact of HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms in protein-protein molecular models; and (3) examine the functional impact of the Tat polymorphisms on the BBB and cells of the CNS. These studies will contribute to defining how HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms affect the function of the CNS and the development of HAND and provide information useful in development of diagnostic assays of HAND and potential preventative and treatment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed research is to identify and characterize genetic variation in the HIV-1 regulatory protein Tat with respect to alteration in it functional impact on cells of the CNS as well as the blood- brain barrier (BBB). This will be accomplished by examining amino acid changes within peripherally-derived and CNS-derived Tat proteins from neurologically impaired and unimpaired HIV-1-infected patients to define how HIV-1 Tat polymorphisms affect the development of HIV-associated neurologic disorders (HAND) and provide information useful in development of diagnostic assays of HAND and potential therapeutic strategies and vaccines.",HIV-1 Tat genetic variation impacts NeuroAIDS,9610566,R01NS089435,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired

"lntegration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data PROJECT SUMMARY The onset of most human disease involves numerous molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway, and treatment contexts. This system is probed by thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, and integrative analysis of these data can generate testable hypotheses identifying causal genetic variants and linking them to network level changes in cells to disease phenotypes. This can enable deeper molecular-level understanding of pathophysiology, paving the way to genome-based precision medicine.  The long term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through integrative analysis of high- throughput biological data in a disease context. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration methods, created algorithms for the prediction of disease genes through context-specific and mechanistic network models and analysis of quantitative genetics data, and made novel insights into important biological processes and diseases. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by building public interactive systems capable of real-time user-driven integration that are popular among experimental biologists.  We now propose to connect these gene-level functional network approaches with the underlying genomic variation by deciphering how genomic variants lead to specific transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects. We propose to develop ab initio sequence-level models capable of predicting biochemical effects of any genomic variant (including rare or never observed) on chromatin state and RNA regulation, then link these effects with gene-level regulatory consequences (including tissue-specific transcription and RNA splicing), and finally put genomic sequence directly into the network context via a statistical approach for detecting genes and network neighborhoods with a significantly elevated mutational burden in disease. Our key deliverable will be a user- friendly, interactive web-based framework enabling systems-level variant impact analysis in a network context and an open source library for computational scientists. In addition to systematic analysis across contexts and diseases, we will collaborate with experimentalists to apply our methods to Alzheimer’s, autism spectrum disorders, chronic kidney disease, immune diseases, and congenital heart defects as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to directly contribute to better understanding of these diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE To pave the way for mechanistic interpretation of disease in the genomic context and eventually, precision medicine, we will develop algorithms for de novo prediction of functional biochemical effects of noncoding variants at the DNA regulation and RNA processing levels and then build frameworks for sequence-based prediction of tissue-specific transcription and post-transcriptional RNA processes (starting with splicing). To facilitate discovery of disease mechanisms, we will develop approaches for analyzing these variant effects in a network context, including those developed in the previous grant period (mechanistic and functional networks) and novel network models that integrate exon usage information or enhancer-gene interactions. In addition to verifying top predictions experimentally in our group or by our collaborators in case study areas of neurodegenerative disease, chronic kidney disease, ASD, and congenital heart disease, we will make our methods available to the broader biomedical community through public, interactive user interfaces and open source libraries.",lntegration and Visualization of Diverse

"Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in cancer[1], common disease[2]and rare disease diagnosis.[3] Despite their success, our ability to fully interpret the clinical relevance of personal genome variation remains a significant gap[4-6]. Considering this, the most crucial need is more genotype-phenotype data that link genetic variation with disease causation. The objective of this proposal is to improve the clinical interpretation of genetic variation; in particular, by developing integrative approaches that predict the effect of genetic variation on clinical phenotype. This proposal addresses the hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, that combining patient transcriptomic data with genotypic and clinical data (as opposed to each alone) offers a better mechanistic understanding of disease natural history, from initial presentation to progression. The specific aims are designed such that each independently add substantial functional genomic information, over and above previously available patient genetic data, to further resolve the clinical phenotype. Aim 1 establishes a comprehensive and widely-shared dataset of patient transcriptomic (and genetic) variation across multiple cancer, cardiovascular and thrombosis/bleeding phenotypes, in patients with somatically-acquired myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and select other rare heritable blood diseases (HBD). Aim 2 methodically determines differential RNA expression and processing between clinically-relevant subgroups of MPN and HBD patients. Aim 3 brings these elements together – and applies two integrative Bayesian and machine learning approaches, RIVER[24] (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation) and LASSO[25] (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), to resolve the functional and clinical relevance of rare variants; and identify signatures most predictive of disease risk or progression. Completion of these aims will contribute new scientific knowledge on how integrating transcriptomic data improves clinical genomic analyses in other genetic (and rare) diseases. In addition, this project will enable the Principal Investigator to develop expertise in the informatics and data science aspects of genomic medicine that complement her current background in biophysics, biochemistry and translational hematology. Combined with additional informatics training at Stanford University through coursework, seminars, one-on-one advising from project mentors, and interactions with the wider statistics, bioinformatics and genomics communities, this project will prepare the Principal Investigator to launch an independent academic career in genomic medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate clinical interpretation of genetic variation in personal genome data is an essential component of personalized medicine approaches and the precise genetic diagnosis toward achieving improved public health. This project will integrate genetic and clinical modifiers with functional genomic information (RNA sequencing) from adequately-powered, disease-relevant cells; and provide direct insight into

"TOOLS FOR NORMALIZING AND INTERPRETING THE CLINICAL ACTIONABILITY OF GENOMIC VARIANTS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The availability of high-throughput, low-cost sequencing has transformed the landscape of biomedical research by dramatically expanding our capacity to interrogate the sequence of the human genome. Consequently, there has been an explosion of biomedical literature describing the role of specific genomic variants and their impact on human diseases. These advances are bringing sequencing into the clinic to shape clinical practice from the patient’s genomic content, a paradigm colloquially referred to as genomic or precision medicine. There remain many obstacles to fully realizing our potential in the era of precision medicine. Among them is a recognized need for robust, well-engineered systems that provide knowledge about genomic variants and their role in disease. Ideally, such systems would provide a comprehensive summary of all knowledge that is relevant to the patient’s unique genomic content. An early bottleneck to realizing precision medicine was that, despite the substantial literature and several established knowledgebases that define interactions between drugs and genes, querying across them was extremely challenging. In response to this need, the Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb, dgidb.org) was developed. Through a combination of automated processing and manual curation, drug-gene interaction information was collected, structured, and connected (normalized) from these diverse sources of data and entered into a database with a user-friendly search interface and an application programming interface (API). However, linking drug and drug-gene interaction concepts across resources remains an extremely challenging task, and aggregated drug-gene interactions are also challenging to represent in a way that highlights the utility of the collected knowledge for precision medicine efforts. This proposal seeks to improve our ability to normalize and interpret drug-gene interactions corresponding to patient genomic variants. We will achieve this goal through two specific aims. First, the DGIdb normalization routines will be improved through incorporation of new content and features. Among these, the DGIdb will support collections of drugs, including combination therapies and drug classes. Also, the DGIdb will have new community submission and curation features, allowing users to incorporate new knowledge into the database. Second, the Variant Interpretation Aggregator database (VIAdb) will be created to normalize knowledge across several disparate sources focused on the clinical interpretations of genomic variants. The VIAdb will operate as a stand-alone web tool and API and will behave as a source of relevant interpretations to DGIdb. Finally, we will develop techniques for automated identification of drug-gene interactions and variant interpretation consensus to assist community curation efforts. If successful, this research will improve breadth and consistency of variant interpretations and drug-gene interactions for precision medicine efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will improve our ability to interpret genomic variations in human patients in support of precision medicine efforts. Specifically, it will provide web-based tools for identifying potential therapies that specifically target the patient’s individual genes or variants, and an assessment of the clinical actionability of those drugs.",TOOLS FOR NORMALIZING AND INTERPRETING THE CLINICAL ACTIONABILITY OF GENOMIC VARIANTS,9744231,K99HG010157,"['Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' combined treatment ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Engineering ', ' Explosion ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Suggestion ', ' Work ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Level of Evidence ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' gene interaction ', ' cohort ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' drug resource ', ' Data ', ' Resource Development ', ' The Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center at the Vanderbilt University ', ' VICC ', ' Collection ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' data modeling ', ' modeling of the data ', ' model the data ', ' model of data ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' cancer type ', ' user-friendly ', ' web interface ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' tumor ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' genomic variation ', ' clinically actionable ', ' application programming interface ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' individual patient ', ' profiles in patients ', ' patient profile ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' therapeutic biomarker ', ' therapeutic marker ', ' web-based tool ', ' ']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K99,2019,115001,0.13951229590253622
"Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms for orofacial clefting (OFC) is limited by the fact that less than half of the heritable risk for this disorder has been assigned to specific genes. Towards identifying pathological sequence variants among the many irrelevant ones detected in exomes and whole genomes of patients with this disorder, an understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the development of relevant tissues, including the oral periderm, is essential. We propose a systems biology approach to analyzing the periderm GRN. Using this approach in the past enabled us to identify three novel OFC risk genes. We will utilize two model organisms, zebrafish and mouse, because the periderm differentiation GRN appears to be highly conserved. In zebrafish, the periderm differentiates very early in embryogenesis, greatly facilitating the execution and interpretation of genetic perturbation analyses. Mouse, on the other hand, has the advantage that its craniofacial anatomy is more similar to that of humans. In Aim 1, we will determine the zebrafish periderm differentiation GRN using a state-of-the-art network inference algorithm, NetProphet 2. This tool carries out both a coexpression analysis and a differential expression analysis. Input data sets will include RNA-seq expression profiles we will generate from loss-of-function (LOF) embryos for 4 key transcription factors (TF) known to participate in this GRN. We will also identify the direct gene linkages of these key TFs in the periderm GRN. Finally, we will test a novel candidate member of the periderm GRN, Tead, by carrying out LOF tests in zebrafish, thereby exploiting the strength of this model system. In Aim 2 we will deduce the murine oral periderm differentiation GRN, also using the NetProphet algorithm. Input datasets will include expression profiles of periderm isolated from the palate shelves of wild-type mouse embryos, and from heterozygous mutants of three key TFs: Irf6, Grhl3 and Tfap2a. For each of the mutant genotypes there is evidence of abnormal periderm differentiation. We will also identify murine periderm enhancer candidates by sorting GFP-positive and -negative cells from Krt17-gfp transgenic embryos, performing ATAC-seq on both populations, and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq on cells from palate shelves and the nasal cavity. As in Aim 1, we will also identify the direct gene linkages of the key TFs. We will train a machine learning algorithm on palate periderm enhancers, and use the resulting scoring function to prioritize OFC-associated SNPs near genes that are expressed in periderm for those that are likely to directly affect risk for OFC. Finally, we will perform allele- specific reporter assays on the top candidate SNPs from each of three loci. The expected outcome is a deeper understanding of the specific TFs and cis-regulatory elements that control differentiation of the periderm. This will have a broad impact because it will enable human geneticists to prioritize candidate risk variants that emerge from whole-exome and -genome sequencing analyses of OFC. Orofacial is a common disease with a major impact on the affected individual, their family and society. Here, we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm, an embryonic tissue that is critical for development of the palate. Our new knowledge will identify candidate genes and help identify pathogenic variants located in regulatory elements which will improve risk assessment and provide new targets for rational therapies.",Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm,9738125,R01DE023575,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Elements ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Epidermis ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Differentiated Gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Nasal cavity ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' vertebrata ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Enhancers ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Oral ', ' Outcome Study ', ' craniofacial ', ' craniofacies ', ' mutant ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' transgenic ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' CDH1 gene ', ' LCAM ', ' CDHE ', ' CDH1 ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Palate ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Embryo Loss ', ' embryonic loss ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' embryo tissue ', ' Embryonic Tissue ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Genetics ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vivo ', ' Periderm ', ' Tissue Differentiation ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' Pathologic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' oral cavity epithelium ', ' oral epithelium ', ' oral epithelia ', ' paralogous gene ', ' paralog ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' orofacial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' loss of function mutation ', ' Heritability ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' loss of function ', ' network models ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' Structural Congenital Anomalies ', ' congenital structural malformation ', ' Structural Birth Defect ', ' orofacial cleft ', ' orofacial clefting ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' model building ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2019,225980,0.08893103234713795
"Comprehensive Characterization of Adaptive Regulatory Variation Linked to Human Disease Project Summary/ Abstract  Over the past decade there has been a rapid expansion of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), as well as the development of large-scale consortia like the UKBioBank and the All of Us project. While the number of genetic associations to human traits and disease is soaring, tools to characterize and interpret these variants are lacking. One challenge to realizing the potential of genomics is that over 99% of human genetic variation is non-coding, regulatory sequences. However, ‘regulatory grammar’ – the complex pattern of sequences that interact with transcription factors to control gene expression, is poorly understood. A repertoire of well-characterized causal variants is needed to build generalizable models with which to unlock insights into the genetic basis of human health and history.  Natural selection is a powerful driver of human genetic variation. As our species has encountered new climates, dramatic alterations in diet, and novel pathogens, these selective pressures have left hundreds of signatures of adaptation in our genomes, reflected in our species’ diversity of disease risk and morphology. For selection to have acted positively on them, these adaptive alleles must exhibit relatively strong phenotypic effects, and they continue to contribute to modern traits and disease (e.g. height or sickle cell anemia). Salient examples of human adaptation include immunity, metabolism, and morphology, all of which have extensive, unresolved GWAS signals. This renders the lens of recent evolution a powerful, but underutilized, tool for identifying alleles that contribute to phenotypic variation in modern association studies.  This proposal aims to expand the repertoire of well-characterized GWAS signals, by A) using evolution to prioritize adaptive variants, and B) applying novel, high-throughput experimental and computational tools to comprehensively decipher the functions of regulatory variants. These approaches will identify much needed causal variants, devise paradigms for their study, and inform future predictive models to characterize them. During the mentored phase of the K99, I will first develop methods to colocalize signals of selection and GWAS, and then use Variant Effect Predictions (VEP) to predict their function. I will then employ high-through methods such as a the massively parallel reporter assay and CRISPR non-coding screen to functionally characterize them directly. From the adaptive GWAS alleles our screens identify, we will make in-vivo system to more deeply characterize them during the Independent R00 phase. During this time I will deploy a variety of genomic tools such as ChIP, ChIA-PET, and RNA-seq to understand the adaptive variants’ molecular etiology. I will use the empirical data fro these studies, and the MPRA/HCR-FlowFISH screens to build more accurate VEP models. ! Project Narrative While thousands of genomic regions have been linked to human evolution and diseases, many of the genetic variants responsible are non-coding and thus difficult to interpret. I propose to identify adaptive human alleles underlying genome wide association studies and comprehensively characterize them using novel computational and experimental tools. I will then make in-vivo models of these to test their function and effects on fitness, improving future predictions of how genetic variants impact human evolution and health.",Comprehensive

"Micropublications for Automating Genome Sequence Variant Interpretation from Medical Literature PROJECT SUMMARY Accurate and efficient interpretation of genomic variants for clinical decision making is predicated on ready access to useful information in the medical literature. The sheer number of potentially relevant articles that must be examined during this curation process poses a major challenge in ensuring the accuracy and reproducibility of clinical variant interpretation as it is time-consuming and the results highly user-dependent. To this end, we have developed the Mastermind Genomic Search Engine - a commercial database that automatically organizes disease, gene and variant information from the medical literature by systematically indexing millions of scientific articles. In direct comparison to manually developed databases of genetic variants, we have achieved greater than 97% concordance and accurately identified >50% more variants with an average of 3-fold more references demonstrating the effectiveness of our automated approach. Currently, Mastermind is used by over 1800 variant scientists in 25 different countries to more quickly curate literature for genetic variants in clinical settings. In response to feedback from ClinGen curators and others, the present proposal seeks to create a framework to facilitate literature curation and clinical variant interpretation activities within Mastermind by 1) prioritizing relevant references and external database entries containing content meaningful to variant classification guidelines, 2) assembling this information into a “micropublication” text format with codified data fields including population frequencies, computational predictions, reference citations and relevant sentence fragments with conclusive content, 3) allowing users to manually review, alter and augment pre-populated entries and 4) providing a platform to share and continuously update this information with other variant scientists in the Mastermind community and elsewhere. Developing tools that allow for collaborative curation in real-time at the point of interaction with source material (i.e. individual articles) will mitigate reproducibility challenges plaguing other large-scale crowd-sourced projects. In contrast to genetic variant databases of user submitted classification information and associated data, the present proposal seeks to create enhanced curation tools to fill such variant databases with more accurate and reproducible data and in a way that would promote dramatic scaling of variant curation activities including those undertaken by groups like ClinVar. To test this approach, we will work with industry partners engaged in variant curation activities to 1) determine the requisite data fields, 2) integrate external database information, 3) test the accuracy and relevance of results and the overall efficacy of the approach using hundreds of manually curated genetic variants, and 4) solicit and incorporate feedback from our development partners to iterate and refine the software features for the greatest effect. Within the $4B genome sequencing software market, there is significant commercial potential and scientific merit in bringing more automated techniques of data analysis to large-scale genome sequencing variant interpretation as described in this proposal.

"IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset PROJECT SUMMARY Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 200 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, meeting recruitment objectives and taking roles in IBDGC leadership positions. Our particular focus is on African American (AA) IBD genetics. We performed the first large-scale evaluation of European loci in the AA population, replicating several genes, but also finding unique African-ancestral variants within these loci, as well as identified multiple admixture significant loci. We also published the first AA IBD genome-wide association study (GWAS), a collaborative effort that identified two African-specific gene loci, and replicated multiple additional European loci. We have also explored why some loci with proven risk variants in Europeans and other populations only cause disease in one ancestral population but not others. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population. In this application we will re-evaluate the AA GWAS by better imputation, evaluate whole genome sequencing data to test low frequency and rare variants, and perform an evaluation for chromosome X variants. We will recruit a large number of AA IBD patients through our own and multiple Satellite Recruitment Centers to power a second AA IBD GWAS, both UC and CD, and meta-analyze with the first to identify more novel loci, identify more African specific risk variants, and replicate known loci for this population and replicate our admixture loci. We will also incorporate diverse data sources to incorporate into our GWAS analyses including RNA-Seq currently being generated on lymophoblastoid cell lines from AA CD cases and controls, and RNA-Seq that we will generate in colonic biopsies from UC cases and controls. We will evaluate chromatin differences and expression of genes in cell types relevant to IBD from European, AA and East Asian ancestries in an effort to better understand locus heterogeneity by ancestry. We will continue to participate in all IBDGC activities to maximize the Impact of IBD genetics research by this cooperative funding mechanism. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.4 million Americans suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic debilitating disorder with no cure that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD ranks in the top 5 in prevalence for gastrointestinal disorders and represents a significant financial burden to society requiring a lifetime of medical care. This proposed research aims to determine the genetic variations that cause IBD which will aid in developing preventive measures, improving the quality of care with better treatments and educating

"Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks The goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods that will identify genes driving epistasis between quantitative trait loci. Genetic association studies in both humans and model organisms have been increasingly able to detect interactions among genetic variants that influence disease risk and pathogenesis. However, identifying which genes are represented by individual variants is a major challenge. Many variants influencing disease are situated between genes, and even those that are in genes may be representing an effect from a neighboring gene. In model organism studies the situation is even more problematic. In breeding experiments, genetic associations with phenotypes typically encompass large regions of DNA with many genes, and experimental follow-up to identify the genes responsible for the association is resource-intensive. To address this problem, we are developing computational tools to prioritize putative gene interactions in interacting genomic regions for biological follow-up. We use machine learning classifiers trained on functional gene-gene interaction networks and combinatorial optimization to identify likely candidate gene-gene interactions responsible for epistatic interactions between genomic regions. Our methods sift through enormous spaces of candidate interactions, retaining only those whose functional interactions identify as plausible for supporting the epistatic interaction. These tools hold promise to dramatically limit the resource-intensity of biological follow up of putative epistasis and to clarify the genetic architecture of complex disease. Genetic studies in humans and model organisms are critical to understanding how genes interact to influence disease. Standard association studies, however, do not identify individual genes, but rather large genetic regions containing many genes, and determining individual genes responsible for phenotypic effects requires resource-intensive biological follow-up experiments. We are developing computational methods to prioritize genes in these regions for biological follow-up, with the ultimate goal of speeding the discovery of novel roles of genes in disease.",Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Complex Disease by Integrating Patterns of Epistasis with Functional Genomic Networks,9712956,R21LM012615,"['Algorithms ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bacteria ', ' Breeding ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Engineering ', ' genetic epistases ', ' gene x gene interaction ', ' epistatic relationship ', ' Interaction Deviation ', ' Epistatic Deviation ', ' Epistasis ', ' Genetic Epistasis ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Proteins ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' progressive systemic sclerosis ', ' Systemic Sclerosis ', ' Systemic Scleroderma ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Training Support ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Letters ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' gene interaction ', ' mutant ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' trait ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' genetic association ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Address ', ' Copy Number Polymorphism ', ' copy number variation ', ' copy number variant ', ' Data ', ' The Jackson Laboratory ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Lower Organism ', ' Ontology ', ' Molecular ', ' Knock-out ', ' Knockout ', ' Modification ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' combinatorial ', ' human disease ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', "" Alzheimer's disease model "", ' alzheimer model ', ' AD model ', ' systemic autoimmune disease ', ' systemic autoimmune disorder ', ' Combinatorial Optimization ', ' Genetic study ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' genomic biomarker ', ' genomic marker ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' human model ', ' genetic architecture ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NLM,JACKSON LABORATORY,R21,2019,223200,0.09668618783030566
"Enhancing molecular diagnosis in children with multiple congenital anomalies using clinically focused splicing prediction algorithms The training included in this career development award promotes the applicant's development as a physician-scientist during his the PhD phase of his MD/PhD training in transdisciplinary computational genomics. The applicant has previously completed a Master's Degree in Mathematics, and has had extensive instruction in general computational biology. This unique melding of high-level computational expertise and interest in applied genomics has led to the development of this innovative project. He is now being co-mentored by Drs. Barash and Bhoj to gain complementary practical training in predictive algorithm development and molecular genetics. In both his clinical and research interests he is dedicated to improving the rate of molecular diagnosis for children with rare Mendelian disorders. His short-term goals include developing and refining his skills in RNA splicing prediction and human genetic variation analysis in exome and genome data. In addition, he will gain new insight into experimental design, data interpretation, and scientific communication skills to ensure his successful post-doctoral transition. His co-mentors for the proposal are Drs. Yoseph Barash and Elizabeth Bhoj, international leaders in computational genomics and molecular genetics. In addition he will be supported by outstanding resources of the MSTP at Penn, which has an extensive proven track record of successful previous awardees.  The applicant has been pursuing work in creating an improved computational pipeline for the analysis of variants from exome and genome data. Specifically he is capturing the intronic and synonymous variants that are generally removed from the analysis pipeline because of the difficulty in determining the pathogenicity of such variants. As there are many intronic and synonymous variants that are known to cause Mendelain disorders, this clearly leads to missed diagnoses. In Aim 1 he will generate an interpretable algorithm for prioritizing general splicing variants that guides functional validation. In Aim 2 he will identify novel variants and genes for mechanistic evaluation in the pathogenesis of congenital anomalies. This algorithm will be generally applicable, significantly enhancing our ability to provide molecular diagnoses for all patients with suspected Mendelian disorders. In addition, this proposal will allow the candidate to gain experience, knowledge, and new skills to successfully lay the foundation as a physician-scientist in computational genomics. Many children who are born with multiple medical issues have a genetic cause for their differences, but even the best tests cannot identify the genetic cause.

"EMERGE PHASE III CLINICAL CENTER AT PARTNERS HEALTHCARE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The eMERGE III Clinical Center proposal from Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank, clinical data in the electronic medical records (EMR) for >4 million participants from the largest integrated health care provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise and state-of-the-art genetic analysis. We propose three aims. (1) Aim 1. Discovery. We will test the hypothesis that common and rare variants from a custom chip including 50,000 loss of function (LoF) alleles will be associated with cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric and immune-mediated phenotypes derived from the EMR. We are currently genotyping 25,000 Partners HealthCare Biobank subjects with a custom chip that includes LoF alleles from 63,000 exomes that we have analyzed. (2) Aim 2. Penetrance and Pleiotropy. We will test the hypothesis that sequencing a set of established genes or loci will allow us to discover additional variation, and define penetrance and pleiotropy using EMR phenotypes. Rare variants in genes selected by the eMERGE network will be studied for penetrance and pleiotropic outcomes by PheWAS and chart review. In addition, we are poised to perform recall-by-genotype studies because all Biobank participants have provided consent for such callback. (3) Aim 3. Implementation. We will test the hypothesis that physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based upon voluntary return of actionable variants to provide safe and cost-effective benefits to patients. We will screen our entire Biobank population of 25,000 individuals for pathogenic variants in the LDLR gene, the leading genetic cause of premature coronary artery disease, and conduct an exploratory trial in disclosing this information. Biobank participants with pathogenic variants in LDLR will be offered enrollment into a randomized trial, in which their finding will be CLIA-confirmed, and in one arm, this result will be communicated to their physicians through the EMR. Over one year, we will collect the following outcomes through participant surveys and EMR queries: physician visits, laboratory testing, changes in medication prescriptions, LDL levels, medical costs and the number of family members screened and treated as a result of the intervention. We will collaborate with the entire eMERGE III Network to incorporate what we learn from this pilot trial into large-scale implementation protocols for the genes selected by the Network for sequencing. Finally, we will participate in all Network activities to enhance the movement of genetics into clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The discovery and clinical use of genetic variants associated with both rare Mendelian and more common complex diseases promises to dramatically change the practice of medicine. Our eMERGE III project will leverage a large Biobank and a rich electronic medical record to define the phenotypic impact of mutations emerging from sequencing and then return results on selected variants to Biobank participants using a clinical trial.",EMERGE PHASE III CLINICAL CENTER AT PARTNERS HEALTHCARE,9882457,U01HG008685,"['Algorithms ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Rheumatoid

"Functional characterization of genetic and post-transcriptional variation using machine learning methods The goal of this research proposal is to develop new in-silico approaches for accurate functional annotation of genetic and post-transcriptional variants. The rapid growth of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and high- throughput -omics data have brought us one step closer towards mechanistic understanding of the complex genetic disease, such as cancer, neurological disorders, diabetes, and others at the molecular level. In particular, these data revealed that complex diseases commonly manifest changes at the genetic and post- transcriptional levels. Bot of these types of changes often affect structure and function of the corresponding genes and their products. Understanding the functional implications of the genetic and post-transcriptional variation is an important task as it can provide critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. Here, we propose to leverage novel machine learning paradigms to design computational methods for predicting the effect of genetic and alternative splicing variants on the macromolecular interactions. Macromolecular interactions underlie many cellular functions in a healthy organism. The disease-induced changes in the genes, such as single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and alternative splicing variations (ASVs) have been recently reported to cause the protein-protein interaction network rewiring. Unfortunately, the experimental high-throughput techniques that characterize the large-scale effects of SNVs or ASVs on PPIs are expensive, time-consuming, and far from being comprehensive. The current in-silico methods either suffer from the limited applicability, or are less accurate when compared with the experimental methods. To overcome these challenges, we will use two recent machine learning paradigms, learning under privileged information (LUPI) and semi-supervised learning. If successful, we expect for the proposed methods to provide the critical advancement in the two main challenges of the current computational approaches, the limited coverage and lower than the experimental accuracy. The methods will be freely available to the community as the stand-alone tools as well as web- servers. The goal of this proposal is to build computational tools that discover the links  between the disease-associated mutations as well as alternatively spliced protein isoforms  and the protein-protein interactions mediated by the disease proteins. The tools use advanced  machine learning methods to find such links in a fast and inexpensive way. These tools  will be useful in elucidating the molecular mechanisms implicated in the complex genetic disorders.",Functional characterization of genetic and post-transcriptional variation using machine learning methods,9730612,R21LM012772,"['Affect ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nucleotides ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Genetic ', ' gene function ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' One-Step dentin bonding system ', ' One Step ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Isoforms ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Data ', ' Homology Modeling ', ' Mutate ', ' RNA-Protein Interaction ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Molecular ', ' Genetic Annotation ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' rapid growth ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Consumption ', ' transcriptomics ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' gene product ', ' preservation ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genetic condition ', ' human interactome ', ' random forest ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' web server ', ' ']",NLM,WORCESTER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R21,2019,193732,0.0676275898151965
"Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages Regulatory networks that control which genes are expressed when, are critical players in the maintenance and transitions of different cell states. In mammalian systems such networks are established by a complex interplay of thousands of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, chromatin remodelers and signaling proteins, histone post-translational modifications and three-dimensional organization of the genome. Hence, the identification of genome-scale regulatory networks and their changes remains a computational and experimental challenge, especially for rare and novel cell types. Through recent efforts of consortia projects we now have rich datasets measuring multiple components of the regulation machinery in model cell lines. These data enable the creation of a more complete regulatory network for these cell lines. Can we use this information to identify networks in new cell types where measuring only a few components of the regulation machinery is possible (e.g. the transcriptome)? Can we leverage more complete regulatory networks to predict new cell types, and to predict the effect of network perturbations to cellular state? To tackle these questions, in this proposal we will develop innovative network reconstruction methods to identify regulatory networks in novel and rare cell types by leveraging their relationships to well-studied cell types, as well as to each other. Our methods will use the framework of non-stationary graphical models to represent cell type-specific regulatory networks and will use multi-task learning to incorporate shared information between cell types in a lineage. Methods in Aim 1 will infer modular gene regulatory networks for each cell type and additionally refine an existing incomplete or uncertain lineage structure. Methods in Aim 2 will identify cell type-specific directed dependencies among chromatin state and transcription factors and how they impact target gene expression through proximal and long-range regulation. Our methods will be applied to two cell-fate specification problems: cellular reprogramming and multi-cell lineage forward differentiation. In cellular reprogramming, regulators and subnetworks hindering reprogramming efficiency will be predicted and tested using genetic perturbation experiments. In forward differentiation, regulatory network changes that drive alternate lineages will be identified and tested. Successful completion of this project will provide two broadly applicable software tools that will enable researchers to (i) accurately identify regulatory networks and their changes between different cell states in complex cell lineages, (ii) examine interactions among multiple levels of regulation and their impact on cell type-specific gene expression, and (iii) efficiently identify the most upstream regulatory genes and subnetworks that change cellular states. Software tools from this project will be made available and will be broadly applicable to diverse types of dynamic biological processes in development and disease. Project Narrative Many human diseases are due to aberrant activity of genes in specific cell types. Transcriptional regulatory networks specify what genes must be expressed in which cell types and play a central role in the type and function of cells. Therefore, the ability to identify these networks in each cell type and the network changes that result in changes in cell type is important for a better understanding of human health and disease. Computational methods that can identify regulatory networks and their dynamics across related mammalian cell types offer a powerful approach to create better models of human disease and for regenerative medicine.",Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages,9729760,R01GM117339,"['Algorithms ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' Correlation Studies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Health ', ' Histones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Distal ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Training ', ' Sample Size ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' genetic regulatory protein ', ' regulatory gene product ', ' Regulatory Protein ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' chromatin remodeling ', ' cell fate specification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Regenerative Medicine ', ' Signaling Protein ', ' Signaling Pathway Gene ', ' Signaling Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' human disease ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' epigenome ', ' learning network ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' human model ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' multi-task learning ', ' multitask learning ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,303220,0.07843373973118173

Better understanding of the genetic basis of structural birth defects will lead to new insights into human developmental biology and will provide targets for medical intervention and treatment. Recent large-scale genome and exome sequencing studies of birth defects have identified new risk genes, especially through the analysis of de novo variants in protein coding regions. However, we are still far from complete understanding of the genetic causes of birth defects. Estimates are that there are 400- 800 risk genes of large effect size for birth defects such as congenital heart disease, and the vast majority of these genes are unknown. This is primarily due to the lack of statistical power. While increasing sample size is essential and is part of the core deliverables of the Gabriella Miller Kids First (GMKF) programs, we also need to develop and apply new analytical methods that improve power and maximize the utility of the available genetic data by using other types of data and biological knowledge. In addition, in most prior studies, the analysis of rare genetic variation has been focused on small variants in the coding regions or large copy number variants (CNV). The data and methods to interrogate the contribution of rare noncoding variants is rudimentary, limiting our understanding of genetic architecture of these diseases. In this study, we propose two aims to address these questions by leverage GMKF cross-disease whole genome sequencing data sets: Specific Aim 1. Elucidate genetic architecture by cross-disease analysis of rare coding and non-coding variants. Specific Aim 2. Integrate gene expression with genome sequencing data to improve discovery and biological interpretation of risk genes of structural birth defects.  The proposed study will maximize the genetic discovery potential of the GMKF WGS data sets for birth defects and improve our understanding of the pleiotropic effects and tissue specificity of risk genes and variants. The analytical approaches developed in this study will be applicable to genetic data of birth defects and developmental disorders from future GMKF cohorts and other programs. Project Narrative We propose to analyze whole genome sequencing data from the Gabriella Miller Kids First cohorts using new computational approaches that maximize the risk gene discovery and improve interpretation of candidate genes.

"Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families Project Summary: Although affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees have substantially elevated recurrence risk compared to singleton cases, the mean polygenic risk scores between these groups do not differ, suggesting that one source of this higher familial recurrence risk is rare, higher impact variation. We will collect whole genome sequence (WGS) from 600 affected members of multiplex schizophrenia pedigrees to identify rare variation shared by affected individuals within and between pedigrees potentially accounting for the increased recurrence risk, and reducing the `variant space' under consideration. After QC and calling in our existing pipeline, a) familial sequence variants in the exome will be directly analyzed in 2000 Irish cases and 2000 Irish controls with 30X exome sequence data in production currently, and b) variants outside the exome will be imputed into 3600 Irish singleton schizophrenia or bipolar disorder cases and 3000 Irish population controls with GWAS framework data; 3781 additional UK10K controls with 10X WGS are available to increase analysis power. This imputed dataset will be analyzed using recently developed methods for kernel-based tests of variation aggregated over a defined interval (such as a gene) that avoid the inflation of type-1 error. We use multiple sources of genomic information to develop weights for each position in the genome (indexing the prior probability that a change at the site has functional consequence) and each variant detected (indexing the probability that observed changes have functional consequence), and we propose to improve the existing genomic information sources for this weighting in a number of ways. In aim 3, prioritized variants from aim 2a/2b will be directly genotyped in the case/control samples by custom microarray; individual genes or genesets showing enrichment of variation in cases (if any are observed) will be resequenced in the case/control sample. In Aim 4, the directly assessed genotypic and sequence data from aim 3 will be analyzed using standard methods to identify individual associated variants, and variant-enriched genes, genesets or other functional sequences. We seek to unambiguously identify 1) individual variants that are significantly more common in cases, or 2) individual genes or other functional sequences or 3) gene- or functional sequence sets enriched for variation in cases to provide critical information about the brain systems perturbed in schizophrenia, and the mechanisms by which such alleles increase risk. Project Narrative Rare sequence variation has been implicated in many human complex traits, incuding schizophrenia, and has been studied in unrelated cases and controls and parent:offspring trios, but remains unstudied in multiplex families. Sequencing the genomes of such families will allow conprehensive identification of variation in protein coding genes, non-coding expressed loci, regulatory sequences, and evolutionarily conserved regions, as well as detection of structural variation, and testing these alleles in a large case/control series of the same ethnic and geographic origin offers significant advantages over prior study designs, and has the potential to identify individual alleles, variant enriched genes, variant enriched non-genic sequences, and/or variant enriched genesets contributing to SCH risk in the Irish population. Such variants offer great potential for understanding the functional impact of risk alleles and improving mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia and related disorders.",Whole Genome Sequencing in Irish Multiplex Schizophrenia Families,9749268,R01MH114593,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Irish Free State ', ' Eire ', ' Ireland ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Methods ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Parents ', ' pedigree structure ', ' Pedigree ', ' genetic pedigree ', ' Population Control ', ' Probability ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' psychotic illness ', ' Psychoses ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' offspring ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' genome sequencing ', ' LGALS3BP gene ', ' MAC-2-BP ', ' 90K ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' power analysis ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' ']",NIMH,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,430191,0.17127245251259096
"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation,9786812,R01HG010045,"['Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Comparative Study ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Ice ', ' Joints ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' training transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' Measures ', ' Enhancers ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' cell type ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Performance ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Graph ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Tissue-Specific Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression ', ' Differential Gene Expression ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' epigenomics ', ' cost ', ' markov model ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' multitask ', ' multi-task ', ' human disease ', ' comparative ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' epigenome ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' chromosome capture ', ' chromatin conformation capture ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' multi-task learning ', ' multitask learning ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,352626,0.07424294362378542
"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,9766882,UM1HG009435,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' type one diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1DM ', ' T1D ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1 DM ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dissection ', ' Elements ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Logic ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE - Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' SLE ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Amino Acid Substitution ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' trait ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' K-562 ', ' K562 blasts ', ' K562 ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Lupus ', ' human disease ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' biological systems ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' HepG2 ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' Hep G2 ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR interference ', ' CRISPRi ', ' CRISPR screen ', ' clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats screen ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 screen ', ' CRISPR-based screen ', ' CRISPR editing screen ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2019,1497668,0.16975207237621465
"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases. The advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms will provide efficient big-data integration tools for epigenetics, gene regulation and human genetics.

"Methods for analysis of regulatory variation in cellular differentiation One of the key challenges in human genomics currently is to dissect the impact of sequence variation on gene regulation. Characterizing the functional consequences of regulatory variation would lead to a greater understanding of evolutionary constraint on gene expression, improved interpretation of whole genome sequencing, and a more complete picture of the genetic architecture of complex disease. However, interpreting non-coding genetic variation remains difficult, particularly due to the complexity of gene regulation, which is highly specific to cell-type and environmental context. Understanding how disease-associated genetic variation impacts human tissues requires that we identify mechanisms behind cell-type-specific regulatory variation. In order to address these important goals, we propose to create a resource in which we can directly assay a range of regulatory phenotypes in multiple cell-types. We propose to establish a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 70 individuals and collect genomic data from iPSCs and differentiated cells. This empirical effort will be complemented by formulating a novel statistical methodology to integrate data across different assays, cell-types, time points, and individuals; to robustly identify regulatory networks and genetic variants that affect gene regulation in each context. Together, these contributions will provide a basis for ongoing study of gene regulation and sequence variation in multiple disease-relevant cell types using a renewable model system and novel methods for robust analysis of these data. In Aim 1, we propose to develop the resource of 70 iPSC lines, where we will collect extensive molecular regulatory phenotypes at multiple time points throughout differentiation to three cell types (cardiomyocytes, neurons and hepatocytes). Measuring gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and methylation in each sample throughout differentiation, we will provide a detailed picture of the cascade of regulatory influences active in each cell type and during development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel statistical framework for inferring universal and cell- type-specific regulatory factors from multi-dimensional data spanning cell-types, individuals, phenotypes, and time points. We specify a machine learning method based on Bayesian hierarchical transfer learning that provides dramatically increased power to detect shared effects while explicitly identifying context-specific regulatory changes. This approach will be adopted to infer regulatory networks, identify key regulatory sequence elements, and map QTLs in each phenotype and cell type. In Aim 3, we will utilize the empirical data and novel methods to infer regulatory relationships and mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with gene expression in primary tissue and with disease. We will do this by performing a careful integration of external association studies. All samples, cell lines, data, computational tools, and analytical results will be made freely available to the community. We expect our project will greatly advance the understanding of gene regulation, the consequences of genetic variation in diverse cell-types, and the genetic basis of disease. Project narrative: Understanding the impact of individual genetic variation on diverse tissues and cell types in the human body is essential to dissecting the genetics of complex human diseases.

"Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of sequencing-based functional genomic data profiling the transcriptome, regulome and epigenome in hundreds of diverse cellular contexts has spurred the development of powerful computational methods to learn integrative models of gene regulation. However, models learned on data from static cellular contexts only reveal correlative regulatory relationships. There is a paucity of tractable model systems and experiments profiling dynamic cellular processes and a corresponding lack of computational methods that can learn putative causal mechanisms controlling the precise timing and temporal order of changes in genomic chromatin state and gene expression. Here, we propose novel machine learning methods to learn dynamic models of transcription regulation in the context of cellular reprogramming. In Aim 1, we propose deep learning frameworks with new interpretation engines that can integrate dynamic chromatin accessibility and gene expression data to reveal networks of cis regulatory elements, transcription factor binding complexes and cascades of trans-acting regulatory factors that control cell fate. In Aim2, we will apply our modeling framework to investigate early dynamics of nuclear reprogramming of human fibroblasts to pluripotency. We will leverage a powerful heterokaryon cell fusion model system to generate global chromatin and gene expression profiles over a two day timecourse. In Aim 3, we perform perturbation experiments using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to validate hypotheses generated by our models and test the effectiveness of predicted pluripotency factors and regulatory elements in inducing reprogramming. The validation experiments will be further used to iteratively refine the computational models. We will integrate the time-course data generated in our model system with data from large reference compendia of functional genomic data such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Our analyses will reveal molecular mechanisms crucial to early and transient stages of nuclear reprogramming, providing novel contributions to our fundamental knowledge of regenerative medicine. Finally, the proposed end-to-end integrative framework is highly generalizable and will be of broad utility to learn dynamic models of transcriptional regulation from time-course datasets in other model systems. NARRATIVE Understanding how cells precisely control the timing and order of gene expression changes during dynamic cellular processes remains a challenge. Here, we propose the development of novel machine learning methods based on deep neural networks to decipher dynamic regulatory networks controlling cell fate decisions. We will generate genome-wide temporal profiles of chromatin state and gene expression during nuclear reprogramming, learn integrative models of dynamic gene regulation and perform experiments to validate biological hypotheses generated by the model.",Learning Regulatory Drivers of Chromatin and Expression Dynamics during Nuclear Reprogramming,9722284,R01HG009674,"['Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Cell

"Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract In the United States, the joint disease osteoarthritis (OA) debilitates over one-third of people over sixty-five years old and causes hundreds of thousands of knee replacements annually. Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate knee formation and OA risk and how one inherits risk at specific joints (e.g., knee versus hip). Recent GWAS have identified at least seventeen loci that significantly associate with knee OA risk. However, the casual variants for these loci have not been identified because their association signals span large genomic intervals harboring uninvestigated non-coding regulatory regions. Of these, common variants in the Growth Differentiation Factor Five gene (GDF5), a critical regulator of joint development, reproducibly associate with knee OA risk in human populations. GDF5 OA variants reside on a high frequency 130 kb haplotype possessing numerous mutations that each may be causal for OA risk, but interestingly, no protein coding mutations have been uncovered that explain the associations. In a complementary study, we discovered ten GDF5 regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers) spanning this interval and revealed that they function with tremendous joint specificity (e.g., knee vs. hip). These enhancers were initially tested at incipient stages of GDF5 expression in mouse embryos, but we also know that GDF5 contributes to the differentiation of knee structures (ligaments, tendons, menisci, articular surfaces) well after this stage of development. Our research will bring together knee OA risk variants in patient populations and our knowledge of how GDF5 is controlled at the DNA level. We first aim to assess the functional contributions of joint-specific GDF5 enhancers to pre-natal knee development and adult joint homeostasis using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to excise these elements in vitro in human cells and in vivo in the mouse. Strikingly, our pilot analyses also revealed that a subset of these GDF5 enhancers possesses common and rare human variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with the highest associated OA variants in the interval. Our second aim is to further explore the association between genetic variants in the locus and OA knee shape using data acquired from the complete Osteoarthritis Initiative MR database on adult knees. Our preliminary data reveal that several variants associated with OA knee shape reside in several functional enhancers that control expression of GDF5 in the knee. Finally, our third aim is to functionally test these human regulatory variants for their impact on enhancer activity, knee formation, and OA risk by using transfection studies and CRISPR-Cas9 in human cartilage cells and in the mouse model. Completion of these studies will reveal functional variants in GDF5 that underlie its role in knee shape and OA risk. Project Narrative The Growth Differentiation Factor Five (GDF5) gene is the most reproducibly detected gene region in candidate and genome-wide association studies focusing on knee osteoarthritis risk. The proposed research focuses on (1) assessing the specific functions of key GDF5 regulatory sequences in knee development and cartilage maintenance in mice and humans, (2) the association of genetic variants in GDF5 locus with osteoarthritis knee shape, and (3) the impacts that human GDF5 risk mutations have on chondrocyte and joint biology.",Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind

"Center for Multi- and Trans-ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) will identify genomic variants relevant to health and disease by genome sequencing over 225,000 participants across a multitude of diseases. The GSP will also serve as a pilot for the Precision Medicine Initiative that aims to enroll and sequence more than a million people representative of U.S. ethnic diversity. Here, we propose a GSP analysis center focused on Multi- and Trans- ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases. There is a growing recognition of the substantial scientific advantages, as well as public health importance, of conducting biomedical research across ethnically diverse cohorts. We propose to develop scalable methods that incorporate ancestry to optimize medical genomic study design and improve power for uncovering the role of common and rare variants in disease. Achieving this goal requires expertise across diverse domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for complex disease mapping, and expertise in management of large-scale databases. Here, we have assembled a world-class team of medical and population geneticists, computer scientists, statisticians and clinicians, with leading expertise in the development of novel and scalable strategies for characterizing sequence variants and their role in disease. Importantly, our group has been at the forefront of development of resources, study designs and methods to enable genomic research in U.S. minority populations. Our project has three main objectives. First, we will develop an Automated Scalable Ancestry Pipeline (ASAP) for common disease mapping in diverse populations. ASAP will improve the computational efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods for ancestry inference and develop important extensions to linear mixed models (LMMs) and other mapping strategies leveraging local and global ancestry. We will also develop methods to refine phenotypes and identify common controls for disease studies and define endpoints. Secondly, we will develop tools and resources for trans- and multi-population rare variant discovery that incorporate patterns of local and sub-continental ancestry. We will also develop machine-learning tools for variant annotation that leverage ancestral information, patterns of sequence evolution, and protein structure in a unified framework. Furthermore, we will incorporate population-specific patterns of cellular phenotypes to improve functional prediction algorithms for non-coding and coding variants. Lastly, we will disseminate our results through web-based resource that empower the biomedical research community. We will augment existing resources including ClinGen by annotating and characterizing pathogenic variants across diverse populations. We will develop a secure web-server that allows sharing of summary statistics and analysis pipelines to enable discovery, fine-mapping and functional prediction of genetic variants. Our team has ample experience with NIH-funded consortia and is dedicated to meeting the overall GSP project goals through collaborative work with NHGRI leadership and other funded investigators.

"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.",Massively

"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,9629970,R01GM125639,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Crystallization ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Proteins ', ' Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Targeted Modification ', ' Targeted DNA Modification ', ' Site-Specific Mutagenesis ', ' Site-Directed Mutagenesis ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biochemical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Measurement ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' mutant ', ' success ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Homology Modeling ', ' International ', ' Resolution ', ' Scheme ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' Population ', ' Coupling ', ' biological research ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' screening ', ' biophysical model ', ' biophysical modeling ', ' biophysical techniques ', ' biophysical methods ', ' biophysical methodology ', ' biophysical approaches ', ' Genetic study ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' human interactome ', ' random forest ', ' ']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,563248,0.09885225456127447
"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss phenotypes including noise-induced and age-related hearing loss.",Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics,9593020,R01DC012049,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', '

"Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences The proportion of the human genome that underlies gene regulation dwarfs the proportion that encodes proteins. However, we remain poorly equipped for identifying which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to risk for both rare and common human diseases. Understanding how non-coding sequences regulate gene expression, as well as being able to predict the functional consequences of genetic variation for gene regulation, are paramount challenges for the field. Here, we propose to combine synthetic biology, massively parallel functional assays, and machine learning to profoundly advance our understanding of the `regulatory code' of the human genome. While challenging, the task of unravelling complex codes from large amounts of empirical data is not without precedent. For example, over the past decade, computer scientists working in natural language processing have made immense progress, driven in large part by a combination of algorithmic and computational improvements and enormously larger training datasets than were available to the previous generations of scientists working in this area. Inspired by the revolutionizing impact of “big data” for traditional problems in machine learning, we propose to model gene regulatory phenomena using training datasets with several orders of magnitude more examples than naturally exist in the human genome. We predict that the models learned from massive numbers of synthetic examples will strongly outperform models learned from the small number of natural examples. We will demonstrate our approach by developing comprehensive, quantitative, and predictive models for alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, two widespread regulatory mechanisms by which a single gene can code for multiple transcripts and proteins. However, we anticipate that this basic paradigm – specifically, the massively parallel measurement of the functional behavior of extremely large numbers of synthetic sequences followed by quantitative modeling of sequence-function relationships – can be generalized to advance our understanding of diverse forms of gene regulation. This research seeks to develop predictive models of alternative splicing and polyadenylation by learning from millions of synthetic constructs, orders of magnitude more than the number of endogenous examples. These models will be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease.",Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences,9637415,R01HG009136,"['Algorithms ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Phenomena ', ' Biologic Phenomena ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Computers ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Nanism ', ' Dwarfism ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Nucleotides ', ' polymorphism ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' Isoforms ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' synthetic construct ', ' synthetic DNA ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Polyadenylation ', ' RNA Polyadenylation ', ' Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' synthetic biology ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' human disease ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' exon skipping ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' causal variant ', ' causative variant ', ' causative mutation ', ' causal mutation ', ' causal gene ', ' causal allele ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,582191,0.0807789455599627
"Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants ABSTRACT Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing of complex diseases have revealed a plethora of disease risk variants, most of which lie in noncoding regions of DNA without easily interpretable function. A main functional mechanism of noncoding variants is to alter chromatin accessibility to transcription factors (TFs), thereby influencing gene expression. Predicting the effects of noncoding variants on TF binding and gene expression on a large scale is thus important but remains challenging. Available computational tools for predicting regulatory variants largely rely on TF-binding motif models and/or local chromatin modification features. Here, we aim to develop a novel computational framework to address two major limitations of these methods. First, given that known disease causal noncoding variants often reside outside of TF binding motifs, how can we improve the prediction of TF binding variants outside of motifs? For this, we plan to integrate TF ChIP-seq data with features that are important for TF binding but have not been considered in previous methods, in particular the DNA breathing dynamics (AIM1). DNA breathing reflects local transient opening of the DNA double helix due to thermal fluctuations. We have shown that genetic variants can affect nearby (up to a few hundred base pairs) DNA breathing dynamics that affect TF binding. Using TF ChIP-seq data, we will train models that predict specific TF binding variants in or outside TF motifs, incorporating DNA breathing dynamics with other features such as DNA shapes and cooperative TF binding. Secondly, given that chromatin features only show modest (<2-fold) enrichment of genetic variants associated with complex diseases or traits, how can we improve the prediction of regulatory variants? For this, we will build a computation model, considering the allele-specific chromatin accessibility (ASCA; i.e., two alleles of a heterozygous individual show read imbalance in chromatin accessibility assays) as a functional readout of a regulatory variant (AIM2). We have shown that neuronal ASCA SNPs are highly enriched for those implicated by schizophrenia (SZ) GWAS. Using neuronal ASCA data, we will train models that predict variants with regulatory effects, taking advantage of our TF-specific classifiers (from AIM1). As a proof of concept, the models will be applied to a large SZ GWAS dataset to predict putative causal regulatory variants. We will validate the effects of the predicted top-ranking regulatory SZ variants on gene expression in a well-powered hiPSC sample by combining multiplex CRISPR-based SNP editing and single-cell RNA-seq analysis (AIM3). For SNPs showing the strongest regulatory effects, we will further use CRISPR editing to verify the SNP effect on gene expression and disease-relevant neuronal phenotypes. Accurately predicting TF-affecting noncoding variants will enable better understanding of the large number of noncoding variants implicated in complex disorders and help formulate testable biological hypotheses, ultimately facilitating the development of targeted therapeutics. NARRATIVE We will develop novel computational methods and a cost-effective functional validation approach to systematically infer the effect of disease-associated noncoding variants on transcription factor binding and gene expression. Identifying the functional noncoding variants that are associated with disease risk will help illuminate causal molecular mechanisms, facilitating the clinical translation of genetic findings into disease risk prediction and treatment.",Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants,9670347,R01MH116281,"['Adenine ', ' Vitamin B4 ', ' 1H-Purin-6-amine ', ' Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Chromatin ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' DNA-Binding Proteins ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Methods ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Phenotype ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' mRNA Translation ', ' Genetic Translation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' trait ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' DNA Binding ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' chromatin modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' epigenomics ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' cost effective ', ' open source ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' iPSCs ', ' iPSC ', ' iPS ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' predictive tools ', ' clinical translation ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' causal variant ', ' causative variant ', ' causative mutation ', ' causal mutation ', ' causal gene ', ' causal allele ', ' ']",NIMH,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2019,672622,0.15552375244824795
"Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION While accurate annotations of protein-coding regions in the human genome have been available for many years, annotation and interpretation of regulatory sequences has lagged far behind. This is because—in contrast to protein-coding sequences—the “rules” that govern links from genome sequence to regulatory function are fuzzy, complex, and highly context-specific. Our limited understanding of regulatory regions presents a fundamental challenge for the identification and interpretation of disease variation, especially in the context of personal genome interpretation. Work from ENCODE and other groups has started to close this gap through experimental work, including high-resolution maps of regulatory sites in a variety of cell types, and modeling of the cell-type specific mappings from genome sequence to regulatory function. In this project we will develop a suite of new tools that uses these diverse new data sets to tackle these problems. We will implement and apply powerful new machine learning methods (based on deep learning) to interpret the genomic, context-specific encoding of regulatory information, and to identify genetic variants that impact the encoded information. We will build models using data from a variety of sources including ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GTEx, regulatory variation in the HapMap cell lines, as well as from disease cohorts. Validation experiments will be performed using a new high-complexity CRISPR/Cas9 system developed by our team. We will develop software tools and analytical results that can be widely used for genome interpretation, especially in analysis of personal genomes. By the end of this study we expect to have: (1) developed powerful new computational models for predicting regulatory function in a wide variety of cell types, at unprecedented resolution; (2) implemented novel validation screens in native chromatin at extremely high throughput; and (3) developed new tools for interpreting common and rare regulatory variation, with particular focus on identification of high-impact regulatory mutations in personal genomes. We are committed to timely release of software, data and analysis and are committed to working with the ENCODE Consortium to increase the impact of data and analyses from all study sites. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this project is to develop powerful new computational methods to understand and predict the identity and function of gene regulatory sequences in diverse cell types. We will use these new methods to help us interpret common and rare genetic variation, and to identify variants that may contribute to disease. Outputs from the project will include new methods, software and functional validation data.","Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and

"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches. Computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data produced for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers and genetic disorders. The proposed studies aim to address new challenges arising from the latest sequencing data and to develop faster and more accurate solutions to existing applications. The success of this proposal is likely to unlock the full power of recent sequencing technologies in disease studies and will dramatically reduce the cost of data analyses.",Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data,9693291,R01HG010040,"['Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Chromosomes ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Maps ', ' Modernization ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Running ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Seeds ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Genetic ', ' light weight ', ' lightweight ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' high throughput analysis ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Large-Scale Sequencing ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' deep sequencing ', ' cost ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' Advanced Development ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanopore ', ' nano pore ', ' mammalian genome ', ' user-friendly ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' open source ', ' genome analysis ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' preservation ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genetic condition ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' contig ', ' ']",NHGRI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2019,397125,0.03843626670350099
"Computational tools for regulome mapping using single-cell genomic data Project Summary Understanding how genes' activities are controlled is crucial for elucidating the basic operating rules of biology and molecular mechanisms of diseases. Recent innovations in single-cell genomic technologies have opened the door to analyzing a variety of functional genomic features in individual cells. These technologies enable scientists to systematically discover unknown cell subpopulations in complex tissue and disease samples, and allow them to reconstruct a sample's gene regulatory landscape at an unprecedented cellular resolution. Despite these promising developments, many challenges still exist and must be overcome before one can fully decode gene regulation at the single-cell resolution. In particular, current technologies lack the ability to accurately measure the activity of each individual cis-regulatory element (CRE) in a single cell. They also cannot measure all functional genomic data types in the same cell. Moreover, the prevalent technical biases and noises in single-cell genomic data make computational analysis non-trivial. With rapid growth of data, lack of computational tools for data analysis has become a rate-limiting factor for effective applications of single-cell genomic technologies.  The objective of this proposal is to develop computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory landscape using single-cell genomic data. Our Aim 1 addresses the challenge of accurately measuring CRE activities in single cells using single-cell regulome data. Regulome, deﬁned as the activities of all cis-regulatory elements in a genome, contains crucial information for understanding gene regulation. The state-of-the-art technologies for mapping regulome in a single cell produce sparse data that cannot accurately measure activities of individual CREs. We will develop a new computational framework to allow more accurate analysis of individual CREs' activities in single cells using sparse data. Our Aim 2 addresses the challenge of collecting multiple functional genomic data types in the same cell. We will develop a method that uses single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), the most widely used single-cell functional genomic technology, to predict cells' regulatory landscape. Since most scRNA-seq datasets do not have accompanying single-cell data for other -omics data types, our method will also signiﬁcantly expand the utility and increase the value of scRNA- seq experiments. Our Aim 3 addresses the challenge of integrating different data types generated by different single-cell genomic technologies from different cells. We will develop a method to align single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell regulome data to generate an integrated map of transcriptome and regulome.  Upon completion of this proposal, we will deliver our methods through open-source software tools. These tools will be widely useful for analyzing and integrating single-cell regulome and transcriptome data. By addressing several major challenges in single-cell genomics, our new methods and tools will help unleash the full potential of single-cell genomic technologies for studying gene regulation. As such, they can have a major impact on advancing our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases. Project Narrative Understanding how genes' activities are controlled at single-cell resolution is crucial for studying human diseases. This proposal will develop a coordinated set of computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory programs using single-cell genomic data.

"Discovering Novel Structural Genomic Rearrangements Using Deep Neural Networks Abstract Accurately detecting structural variation in the genome is a challenging task. Many approaches have been developed over the last few decades, yet it is estimated that tens of thousands of variants are still being missed in a given sample. Many of these variants are missed due to the limitations of using short-read sequencing to identify large variants. Although many of these missed variants are located within complex regions of the genome, it has been shown that some still have clinical relevance making their discovery important. New platforms have been developed for sequencing the genome using long-reads and show promise for overcoming many of these limitations creating the ability to identify the full spectrum of simple and complex structural variants. Because this technology is relatively young, new computational approaches to support the analysis of long-read sequencing data can aid in the discovery of these variants which are still being missed. In addition to detecting novel variation in samples with long-read sequencing data, computational approaches can be developed to leverage these novel variant calls to reanalyze the hundreds of thousands of short-read datasets currently available. In this proposal, we plan to develop new computational approaches to identify novel structural variation in the genome. In Aim 1, we will apply a recurrence approach to analyze long read sequencing datasets utilizing deep neural networks. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool to derive profiles of structural variants predicted in long- reads which can be used to identify and genotype structural variants calls in short read data-sets. Together, these approaches will allow researchers to accurately characterize structural variation in both long and short- read datasets. Narrative Structural variation has been implicated in numerous human diseases but there are still tens of thousands of variants being overlooked in the genome. The proposed research aims to detect novel variation by developing new computational tools to analyze data generated by state-of-the-art sequencing methods.

"Algorithms to identify non-coding mutational burden and disease-relevant pathways PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a disease with complex, polygenic etiology with numerous contributing mechanisms. To devise new therapeutics to combat this epidemic, we need to identify causal genes and variants for T2D and related, cardiometabolic traits implicated by human genetic association. Recently, large- scale DNA biobanks attached to electronic health records have facilitated extensive phenotyping in surprising large sample sizes (>500,000 subjects), importantly in diverse ancestries. These data have enabled a dramatic expansion of the number of bona-fide associations for T2D and related traits. While the increase in statistical power is certainly welcome, new opportunities for how to use these data require new computational methods and analytical pipelines. In this renewal, we focus on three areas for new methods development, which we will create and subsequently deploy to accelerate the genetic dissection for cardiometabolic disease. First, the number of associated loci now available permit the opportunity to learn directly from the data, which non- coding sequences functionally relate to T2D risk. We propose to utilize techniques in machine learning to make predictions for T2D and related causal traits, used to identify and prioritize causal variants and functional elements that are disease-predictive. A second challenge is that the quantity and pace at which this data is being produced is outstripping the rate at which even highly expert quantitative scientists can explore and extract novel insights from the data. To combat this problem, we propose to develop an informatics toolkit with apps to perform compute-intensive, important analyses and visualization with these data, tethered to cloud- based or local computation infrastructure. Finally, one key observation that follows biobank-based data analysis is that, at each physically distinct associated locus, numerous additional conditionally independent associations segregate nearby. This series of alleles can be identified through existing methods, but their use in causal inference approaches (i.e., Mendelian Randomization) has not been extensively explored. Here, we will evaluate their utility and develop statistical pipelines to use this spectrum of variation to perform new causal inference studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identification of causal variants and genes underlying type-2 diabetes (T2D) and related cardiometabolic trait associations are key challenge impeding biological understand and therapeutic developments. New, large- scale data sets from DNA biobanks are poised to help overcome these challenges but require the development of new informatics and statistical methods to take full advantage of the data. In this renewal application, we will develop new methods, machine learning applications, informatics tools, and causal inference statistical approaches to identify pinpoint casual variants and genes

"Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recognized as an extremely common disorder that results in excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of automobile crashes. It is also an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiovascular events, increased cancer rates and cancer mortality, and accelerates the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. OSA is a systemic disorder and the cyclical intermittent hypoxia that occurs during sleep affects every organ system. OSA is heritable, with first degree relatives of individuals with OSA having a two-fold increased risk of the disorder. Although this has been known for over two decades, there are very limited data on gene variants conferring risk or protection for OSA. This is likely the result of underpowered studies and GENETIC HETEROGENEITY. There are multiple pathways to OSA. Obesity is a major risk factor, as are craniofacial dimensions. The relative risk of these different risk factors varies by ethnic group. There are also neuronal mechanisms and other physiological risk factors. This proposal seeks to directly address the issue of genetic heterogeneity using a very large sample of patients and state-of- the-art analysis techniques. Towards this end, we have assembled by far the largest sample of well characterized and genotyped patients with OSA. This is the result of collaboration with key sites in the eMERGE Network [Geisinger, Vanderbilt, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern], Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania. We propose to carry out a robust genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using an electronic health record (EHR) derived case definition and quantitative trait analysis of OSA severity. We will use novel machine learning approaches to specifically address genetic heterogeneity. The GWAS approach will be complimented by a PheWAS strategy as another approach to identifying common variants and related clinical phenotypes. Specifically, we will look for variants that associate with OSA and other clinical diagnoses in the EHR. It is likely that gene variants for OSA will have pleiotropic effects. Gene variants identified from GWAS and/or PheWAS will be further assessed. First, we will use available whole exome sequencing data to see if there are relevant rare variants in these genes, as well as to perform exploratory discovery analyses to look for novel rare variation. The functional role of the genes identified will be studied by functional network analysis. Finally, we will assess associations with quantitative data on intermediate traits identified by high throughput craniofacial and intra-oral photography. These data are currently available within the Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium (SAGIC). Future directions will assess the function of the genes identified in model systems and the clinical utility of utilizing variants as part of risk stratification for OSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with multiple adverse consequences. It is known that OSA has a genetic basis, but to date no convincing gene variants have been identified. This study uses state of the art approaches to identifying relevant genes based on a very large sample of patients with OSA obtained from multiple institutions in the United States. It is by far the largest study ever proposed for identifying genes for this common sleep disorder.",Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea,9975264,R01HL134015,"['Affect ', '

"From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes.

"Leveraging Tissue-Specific Regulatory Grammar to Interpret Human Evolution and Non-coding Variation Project Summary  It is now possible to readily identify sequence variants that have been subject to natural selection in human populations. Adaptive variants have been shown to underlie diversity in both disease risk and morphology across human populations, suggesting that the lens of evolution remains a powerful tool for understanding human biology, yet one that is currently underutilized. One challenge to realizing this potential is that over 99% of human genetic variation is non-coding, as are most signals of selection and variants associated with human phenotypic traits. Mutations modifying transcription factor (TF) binding sites in non- coding, cis-regulatory regions are hypothesized to be more amenable to driving phenotypic evolution than coding changes. These cis-regulatory regions are major determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and variation within enhancers has been indicated to play role in selection and disease. However, enhancer `regulatory grammar' – the complex pattern of sequences that interact with TFs to control gene expression, is poorly understood. The challenge of linking a regulatory variant under selection to an adaptive phenotype is similar to that facing disease association studies: the targeted gene, cell type, and biological process are often unknown, hindering further investigation.  Machine learning algorithms automate the discovery of patterns, making them well-suited to uncover sequence constraints and the combinatorial TF binding patterns of enhancers without relying on limited motif databases. I will optimize support vector machine classifiers to elucidate regulatory grammar from over 100 cell types and tissues. These models will be used to predict the impact of sequence variants on cis-regulatory sites, expanding the utility of the NHGRI's ENCODE and Roadmap projects. I will then apply these tissue- specific predictions to signals of selection and/or disease from the NHGRI's 1000 Genomes Project and its genome-wide association studies catalog. By describing the regulatory impact of signals of selection, I will globally describe patterns of functional adaptation across populations, identifying genes, and gene networks targeted by selection and/or disease. I will functionally characterize variants using massively parallel reporter assays and genome editing to give deeper insight into specific cases of evolution relevant for human health.    This project seeks to develop tools and resources to describe the structure and function of sequence variation in the human genome. This proposal seeks to vastly increase the number of elucidated cases of human evolution, and specifically characterize those adaptive variants associated with disease. We will share the functional regulatory predictions for the use in interpreting a broad range of genomic datasets. This work has broad implications, from interpreting genetic variants in populations and understanding functional targets of evolution, to prioritizing non-coding mutations for precision genomic medicine and beyond. Project Narrative While thousands of genomic regions have been linked to human evolution and diseases, many of the genetic variants responsible are non-coding and thus difficult to interpret. I propose to describe the tissue-specific effects of regulatory variants using machine learning algorithms, and then integrate these functional predictions with signals of selection and/or disease association in order to pinpoint genetic variants important for human evolution and health.",Leveraging Tissue-Specific Regulatory Grammar to Interpret Human Evolution and Non-coding Variation,9614325,F32HG009226,"['Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Chromatin ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Evolution ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Logic ', ' Methods ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' Enhancers ', ' Experimental Models ', ' Mediating ', ' Natural Selections ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' Human Biology ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' genome database ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Data ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Tissue-Specific Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression ', ' Differential Gene Expression ', ' trend ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' NHGRI ', ' disease phenotype ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' combinatorial ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' epigenome ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' genome editing ', ' genomic editing ', ' functional adaptation ', ' precision genomic medicine ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' web-based tool ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NHGRI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,46114,0.17322074226230802
"Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genotyping and emerging sequencing technologies have enabled comprehensive interrogation of genetic variation across the human genome, thereby facilitating a study's ability to map genetic variants that influence phenotypes of interes. Nevertheless, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) projects have uncovered only a limited number of trait-influencing loci. While large increases in sample size will improve power to detect such variation, the ascertainment and sequencing/genotyping of such samples are costly and inefficient. Therefore, it is desirable to increase power to detect such variants without requiring additional sample collection. We propose novel methods for improved gene mapping of common and rare susceptibility variants that move beyond standard strategies typically applied to GWAS and NGS studies of complex traits. The first topic we consider is pleiotropic or cross- phenotype effects of genetic variants. Empirical studies have suggested that pleiotropy is widespread throughout the genome and that leveraging this additional information for gene mapping yields a more powerful analysis than an analysis that ignores such information. In Aim 1, we propose novel statistical methods for genetic analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data using an innovative kernel distance-covariance (KDC) framework that allows for an arbitrary number of phenotypes both continuous and/or categorical in nature, as well as an arbitrary number of genotypes (permitting gene-based testing of both rare and common variants). We will use the KDC framework to implement tests of pleiotropy as well as tests of mediation. The second topic we consider is the mapping of rare susceptibility variants using affected pedigrees, which provide many attractive features for rare-variant testing that case-control studies lack. In Aim 2, we propose a series of powerful statistical methods for rare-variant association testing in affected pedigrees that are based on a framework (recently published in AJHG) for rare-variant association testing in affected sibships. The existing framework compares rare-variant burden in a region by an affected sib pair to the number of regions that pairs shares identical by descent. We have shown the method is more powerful than case-control association testing given fixed sample size and further is robust to population stratification. In this proposal, we will extend the framework to handle affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure (rather than just affected sib pairs) and devise a powerful two-stage screening and validation strategy for rare-variant mapping that first compares familial cases in the pedigrees to external controls and then follows up the most interesting findings using an independent test based on our identity-by-descent sharing statistic among the affected relatives used in the first stage. We will apply the methods in Aims 1-2 to relevant data from genetic studies of complex traits in which we are directly involved. We also will implement the methods in public user-friendly software (Aim 3). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a set of statistical approaches to investigate two important topics in gene- mapping studies of complex human traits. First, we will develop techniques for identifying genes that have pleiotropic effects on phenotypes of possibly high dimension and further assess whether such genes have direct effects on such phenotypes or indirect effects through other possible factors. Second, we will develop tools to facilitate identification of rare polymorphic variation that increase risk for complex disease using data from affected pedigrees of arbitrary size and structure. We will evaluate these methods using simulated data and illustrate their value by applying them to genetic projects of complex traits in which we are actively involved. Application of the proposed methods to these datasets should improve our understanding of the genetic origins of various complex traits.",Statistical Tests for Mapping Genetic Determinants of Complex Traits,9616870,R01GM117946,"['Affect ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Joints ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' pedigree structure ', ' Pedigree ', ' genetic pedigree ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Risk ', ' Siblings ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic ', ' Genets ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' pleiotropism ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' user friendly software ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' gene testing ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Categories ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' genetic determinant ', ' genetic association ', ' Applied Genetics ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' cost ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' human disease ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' public health relevance ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' screening ', ' rare variant ', ' rare allele ', ' Genetic study ', ' identity by descent ', ' identical by descent ', ' IBD inference ', ' IBD analysis ', ' phenotypic data ', ' population stratification ', ' high dimensionality ', ' novel sequencing technology ', ' new sequencing technology ', ' emerging sequencing technology ', ' ']",NIGMS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,297373,0.11673529291016699
"Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recognized as an extremely common disorder that results in excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of automobile crashes. It is also an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, hypertension, cardiovascular events, increased cancer rates and cancer mortality, and accelerates the progression of neurodegenerative disorders. OSA is a systemic disorder and the cyclical intermittent hypoxia that occurs during sleep affects every organ system. OSA is heritable, with first degree relatives of individuals with OSA having a two-fold increased risk of the disorder. Although this has been known for over two decades, there are very limited data on gene variants conferring risk or protection for OSA. This is likely the result of underpowered studies and GENETIC HETEROGENEITY. There are multiple pathways to OSA. Obesity is a major risk factor, as are craniofacial dimensions. The relative risk of these different risk factors varies by ethnic group. There are also neuronal mechanisms and other physiological risk factors. This proposal seeks to directly address the issue of genetic heterogeneity using a very large sample of patients and state-of- the-art analysis techniques. Towards this end, we have assembled by far the largest sample of well characterized and genotyped patients with OSA. This is the result of collaboration with key sites in the eMERGE Network [Geisinger, Vanderbilt, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern], Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania. We propose to carry out a robust genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using an electronic health record (EHR) derived case definition and quantitative trait analysis of OSA severity. We will use novel machine learning approaches to specifically address genetic heterogeneity. The GWAS approach will be complimented by a PheWAS strategy as another approach to identifying common variants and related clinical phenotypes. Specifically, we will look for variants that associate with OSA and other clinical diagnoses in the EHR. It is likely that gene variants for OSA will have pleiotropic effects. Gene variants identified from GWAS and/or PheWAS will be further assessed. First, we will use available whole exome sequencing data to see if there are relevant rare variants in these genes, as well as to perform exploratory discovery analyses to look for novel rare variation. The functional role of the genes identified will be studied by functional network analysis. Finally, we will assess associations with quantitative data on intermediate traits identified by high throughput craniofacial and intra-oral photography. These data are currently available within the Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium (SAGIC). Future directions will assess the function of the genes identified in model systems and the clinical utility of utilizing variants as part of risk stratification for OSA. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with multiple adverse consequences. It is known that OSA has a genetic basis, but to date no convincing gene variants have been identified. This study uses state of the art approaches to identifying relevant genes based on a very large sample of patients with OSA obtained from multiple institutions in the United States. It is by far the largest study ever proposed for identifying genes for this common sleep disorder.",Approaches to Genetic Heterogeneity of Obstructive Sleep Apnea,9692399,R01HL134015,"['Affect ', '

"Direct measurement of gene-environment interactions by high-throughput precision genome editing Abstract  Modern genetics has identified many genetic variants that affect traits such as height, but most phenotypic variation still cannot be explained by these variants alone. Importantly, differences in environment often result in individual variation of traits—including disease risk and drug response—for different genotypes. These relationships are known as genotype by environment (GxE) interactions. For example, the sickle cell allele of hemoglobin S causes sickle cell anemia, but also provides a fitness advantage in the presence of malaria by conferring resistance to infection. However, there are few examples where the exact causal variants are known. Therefore, we need to develop new methodology for identifying more of these GxE interactions, to improve prediction of disease risk and treatment outcomes.  In this study, I will fill in the gap of knowledge in GxE interactions by establishing an experimental framework for identifying hundreds of causal GxE variants in parallel, providing the first comprehensive view of GxE causal variant landscape. Specifically, I will study how thousands of genetic variants between a laboratory yeast strain (BY) and a vineyard strain (RM) lead to their differences in growth upon stress and drug treatments, as one form of GxE interaction. In Aim 1, I will use a novel gene-editing technology that can detect the fitness effects of thousands of variants in one experiment, as shown in a pilot experiment. Using this method, I will be able to map hundreds of casual variants that contribute to growth differences under various conditions, such as carbon source, oxidative stress and drug treatment. In Aim 2, I will measure allele-specific mRNA expression (ASE) from BYxRM F1 hybrids in above-mentioned conditions and associate the mapped causal GxE variants, to identify GxE variants that influence growth rate through gene expression. Then, I will apply a machine learning model to predict causal GxE genes using the molecular features found in this study. By mapping causal GxE variants, linking them to gene expression and predicting causal genes through gene expression, I will establish a complete framework for accelerating the discovery of GxE interactions. Public Health Relevance The recent explosion of precision medicine based on genotype and mutations has enabled personalized treatment of diseases. However, how environmental factors influence the outcome of such treatments is not clear. By establishing a framework to study general principles and underlying molecular mechanisms of these gene-by-environment interactions, we will be able to integrate such knowledge in disease risk prediction and personalized treatment.",Direct measurement of gene-environment interactions by high-throughput precision genome editing,9678678,F31ES030282,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' Carbon ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Explosion ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Hemoglobin S ', ' Sickle Hemoglobin ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Somatic Cell Hybrids ', ' Hybrid Cells ', ' Hybrids ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Malaria ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Modernization ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Research ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' S cerevisiae ', "" Brewer's Yeast "", "" Baker's Yeast "", ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Lactose Galactohydrolase ', ' Lactase Enzyme ', ' Lactase ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle RBC ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Height ', ' Resistance to infection ', ' infection resistance ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' trait ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Human Cell Line ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Polygenic Traits ', ' Polygenic Inheritances ', ' Polygenic Characters ', ' Meiotic Recombination ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Resolution ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' Molecular ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' Heritability ', ' public health relevance ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' Genetic study ', ' genome editing ', ' genomic editing ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' precise genome editing ', ' individual variation ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' causal variant ', ' causative variant ', ' causative mutation ', ' causal mutation ', ' causal gene ', ' causal allele ', ' ']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,29016,0.14659080117230058
"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,9988741,R01GM125639,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Crystallization ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Proteins ', ' Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Targeted Modification ', ' Targeted DNA Modification ', ' Site-Specific Mutagenesis ', ' Site-Directed Mutagenesis ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biochemical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Measurement ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' mutant ', ' success ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Homology Modeling ', ' International ', ' Resolution ', ' Scheme ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' Population ', ' Coupling ', ' biological research ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' screening ', ' biophysical model ', ' biophysical modeling ', ' biophysical techniques ', ' biophysical methods ', ' biophysical methodology ', ' biophysical approaches ', ' Genetic study ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' human interactome ', ' random forest ', ' ']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,238632,0.09885225456127447
"Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome Abstract My research aims to understand the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in gene regulation. This involves studying associations among genotype, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, non-coding RNAs, chromatin interactions and gene expression. In order to transform this genome-wide information into new biological discoveries, my laboratory develops scalable and interpretable computational methods based on statistics, graph theory and machine learning. Our recent focus is to address an important gap in the current knowledge of the role of 3D chromatin structure in gene regulation. That is, we aim to define how genotypic variation affects 3D organization of gene promoters, and in turn, their expression. To achieve this at a genome- wide scale is an ambitious goal, because it requires having at a minimum, genotype, gene expression and chromatin interaction profiles in pure populations of specific cell types from a large number of donors. However, my laboratory is uniquely positioned to perform this research because: i) we are involved in a study at the La Jolla Institute (LJI-R24AI108564) that has already genotyped ~100 donors and expression-profiled more than 15 different pure populations of human immune cell types, and we have access to the same samples for chromatin interaction mapping, ii) in collaboration with other groups at LJI, we have already discovered a prototypical example of an interaction quantitative trait locus (iQTL) that alters and rewires interactions from the promoter of a specific gene that is associated with asthma susceptibility, iii) we have the necessary expertise and proven track record in experimental design and computational analyses of various chromatin conformation capture assays. Leveraging the resources available at LJI and our expertise in the field, we will build a unique research program around the novel concept of iQTLs. The emerging set of three main questions we propose to address within the next five years are: Q1) How do we define cell-type-specific iQTLs for common genetic variants? Q2) What is the extent of overlap between iQTLs and GWAS SNPs? Q3) Can we build predictive models for the cell-type specificity of chromatin interactions and iQTLs? Although we propose to define iQTLs only in two abundant, easily accessible, and highly disease-relevant immune cell types, the concept of iQTLs is equally important in other cell types implicated in diseases with a genetic component. Hence, the proof-of-concept developed by this work, without a doubt, will open up a new field in studying a previously uncharacterized role for disease-susceptibility variants, specifically non-coding SNPs, from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gene regulation. Narrative Recent discoveries that allow us to look beyond the one-dimensional sequence of DNA and understand the large-scale organization principals of its three-dimensional folding have been limited when it comes to characterizing the role of fine-scale genetic variations of the DNA code in controlling important cellular processes such as gene expression. This work will employ state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques and develop novel computational methods to define the role of such genetic variants in changing three-dimensional connections made by the promoters of genes in the human genome. This systematic and unbiased genome- wide study will have important implications in changing the way we study the disease relevance of genetic variation by revealing genotype dependence of long-range chromatin interactions between genes and their distal control switches at a scale that has not been achieved to date.",Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome,9751340,R35GM128938,"['Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Chromatin ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' liability to disease ', ' Diathesis ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Dependence ', ' cell type ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Sampling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' histone modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Molecular Biology Techniques ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computational analyses ', ' Gene Structure ', ' Gene Structure/Organization ', ' Gene Organization ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Population ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' graph theory ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' chromosome capture ', ' chromatin conformation capture ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' ']",NIGMS,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R35,2019,449829,0.057334968924630206
"Biomedical Computing and Informatics Strategies for Infectious Disease Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important goal of infectious disease research is to develop genetic predictors of susceptibility. Our success in this endeavor will depend critically on the informatics methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic and genomic data. The goal of this research program is to develop, evaluate, distribute and support new and novel biomedical computing algorithms and open-source software for identifying combinations of genetic predictors of clinically important infectious disease outcomes. This application will target the growing body of rare genetic variants identified by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our clinical application will focus on the prediction of antiretroviral response in clinical trials for HIV/AIDS. We propose here a highly innovative Hierarchical Rare Variant Collapsing Machine (HRVCM) algorithm for identifying and collapsing combinations of rare variants across gene regions (AIM 1). We will then integrate these new collapsed HRVCM variables into our popular Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method that will assess them in combination with common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genome-wide association studies or GWAS (AIM 2). Our novel HRVCM-MDR approach will, for the first time, make it possible to assess non-additive interactions among sets of rare and common variants simultaneously in genetic studies of infectious diseases. We will apply these new and novel methods to approximately 13 million rare and common variants from nearly 3000 subjects that participated in an AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) study to evaluate risk for virologic failure with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens (AIM 3). Finally, we will release all methods as open source to the biomedical research community through our freely available MDR software package (AIM 4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this application is to develop innovative new computational methods for the genetic analysis of infectious diseases. We will focus on the development of methods that are able to detect synergistic effects of multiple genetic variants regardless of whether they are rare of common in human populations.

"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs. Models will then be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and for the design of mRNA therapeutics.",A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics,9894822,R01HG009892,"['synthetic DNA ', ' synthetic construct ', ' computer science ', "" 5'UTR "", ' mRNA Leader Sequences ', "" 5' Untranslated Regions "", "" 3'UTR "", "" 3' Untranslated Regions "", ' UTRs ', ' Untranslated Regions ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' RNA Stability ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' DNA bank ', ' DNA Library ', ' Genomics ', ' voice recognition ', ' protein expression ', ' mRNA Stability ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Expression Library ', ' Genetic Algorithm ', ' Genetic Programming ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' application in practice ', ' practical application ', ' comparative ', ' screening ', ' Ribo-seq ', ' ribosome footprint profiling ', ' ribosome profiling ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' polysome profiling ', ' neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' machine vision ', ' statistical learning ', ' Affect ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Engineering ', ' Human Genetics ', ' In Vitro ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Polyribosomes ', ' Polysomes ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Ribosomes ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Thiouridine ', ' 4-Thiouridine ', ' 4-thio-uridine ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Genetic Translation ', ' mRNA Translation ', ' Translations ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' stable cell line ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,473065,0.10348166147571294

"Computational approaches for comparative regulatory genomics to decipher long-range gene regulation Project Abstract/Summary The three-dimensional organization of the genome is a major player in long-range gene regulation, where regulatory elements such as enhancers affect the expression of a gene hundreds of kilobases away. Changes in three-dimensional organization are associated with tissue-specific gene expression and have been implicated in several human diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Advances in chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies have expanded our repertoire of long-range interactions between enhancers and promoters in model cell lines and have shown that such interactions are established through a complex interplay of chromatin state, transcription factor binding and three-dimensional proximity of genomic regions. However, our current understanding of the dynamics of long-range gene regulation is limited, both across different cell types as well as across different species. This is because of the absence of such datasets in most species and cell types, lack of systematic methods to predict and interpret these interactions, and due to limited approaches to compare both the regions and their interactions across different cell types and especially across species. The overarching goals of this proposal are to develop novel computational methods to jointly identify candidate regulatory elements in multiple species and predict their long- range interactions in new cell types and species where high-throughput 3C datasets are not available or difficult to obtain. In Aim 1, we will develop a phylogenetically aware method of jointly identifying regulatory elements such as enhancers in multiple species. Aim 2 will develop multi-task and transfer learning approaches to predict interactions in new species and cell types by integrating available high-throughput 3C datasets from multiple cell types and 3C platforms. In Aim 3, we will collect a novel multi-species chromatin mark dataset in species-specific endothelial cells to enable a systematic study of long-range gene regulation dynamics. We will apply our computational approaches developed in Aims 1 and 2 on this multi-species epigenomic dataset to identify different regulatory elements and predict long-range interactions in multiple species. We will develop rigorous computational measures to evaluate the quality of predictions from our novel methods and the improvements compared to existing methods based on published 3C datasets. We will further experimentally validate predicted interactions using Capture-HiC in multiple species and using CRISPR/Cas9 experiments. We will examine individual and groups of interactions to identify species-specific, and clade- specific interactions and interpret the corresponding genes in the context of known pathways and curated gene sets associated with cardiovascular diseases. Our methods will be widely applicable to dissect long-range gene regulation in complex phenotypes including diseases. Software tools, resources, original data and experimental protocols developed by this project will be made publicly available. Project Narrative Long-range gene regulatory interactions are emerging as important determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and are often disrupted in different diseases including cancer. Such interactions occur between distally located regulatory sequence elements and genes hundreds of kilobases away. Currently our understanding of long-range gene regulation is limited to a few cell types and model organisms. Computational methods to identify regulatory elements and systematically link them to target genes in diverse cell types and mammalian species can significantly improve our understanding of the impact of long-range gene regulation in human diseases, help interpret regulatory variation in non-coding parts of the genome and assist in the development of better biomarkers.",Computational approaches for

"A Role for Glycemic Variation in Optimizing Management of Diabetes and Vascular Complications PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A role for glycemic variation in optimizing management of diabetes and vascular complications It is well demonstrated that high glucose levels lead to more rapid development of macrovascular and microvascular complications in people with diabetes. However, there is less consistent evidence that lowering glucose levels to near normal levels prevent or slows vascular complications, particularly in more advanced stages of type 2 diabetes. The recent VADT, ACCORD, and ADVANCE trials demonstrated that intensive efforts to lower glucose had only modest effects on the rate of vascular complications. Why glycemic control strategies that focused on reduction of glucose levels and HbA1c did not have the anticipated success in reducing vascular outcomes is not clear. This has raised the possibility that (1) there are glycemic metrics beyond those that reflect average glucose control, such as HbA1c, that can explain this paradox, and (2) there exists heterogeneous treatment effects of intensive glycemic therapy for macrovascular and microvascular complications, with subgroups of patients who do less well with intensive treatment counter-balancing those that do respond. In recent reports we have demonstrated long-term glycemic variability was associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, even after adjusting for traditional markers of glycemic control. Importantly, this appeared most relevant to those receiving intensive glycemic control. These preliminary findings support careful examination of determinants and consequences of glycemic variability. In this proposal, we therefore propose to (a) evaluate and compare the importance of glycemic variation, both short-term measured by 1,5-anhydroglucitol and long-term in the development of macro and microvascular complications; (b) to study whether intensive treatment is beneficial in preventing vascular outcomes when glycemic variation is constrained; (c) genetic variants associated with glycemic variation in T2D patients will explain additional risk in progression to vascular complications beyond the genetic variants associated with mean glycemic levels. PROJECT NARRATIVE The major goals of glucose-lowering therapy in T2D are to reduce the incidence and progression of both microvascular and macrovascular complications. However, several large clinical trials that focused on reduction of glucose levels and HbA1c did not have the anticipated success in reducing macrovascular outcomes. Our proposal focuses on filling the gap of identifying the role of glycemic variability (short-term and long-term) in optimizing management of diabetes and vascular complications.",A Role for Glycemic Variation in Optimizing Management of Diabetes and Vascular Complications,10040813,R21HL150374,"['Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' macrovascular complication ', ' macrovascular disease ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' treatment effect ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' dbGaP ', ' database of Genotypes and Phenotypes ', ' microvascular complications ', ' microvascular disease ', ' small vessel disease ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' individualized medicine ', ' Patient risk ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' Risk stratification ', ' secondary analysis ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' random forest ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Genetic ', ' Event ', ' Visit ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2020,122816,0.060468816936584416
"A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT  The incidence of diagnosed psychiatric disorders has been increasing for decades, leaving millions of afflicted individuals. Despite the high heritability, their underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Most risk loci are located in noncoding genomic elements without direct effects on protein products. Comprehensive functional annotation and variant impact quantification are essential to provide new molecular insights and discover therapeutic targets.  Recent advances in novel sequencing technologies and community efforts to share genomic data provide unprecedented opportunities to understand how genetic variants contribute to psychiatric diseases. This application describes the development of integrative strategies and machine learning methods to combine novel assays (such as STARR-seq) with population-scale genomic profiles to elucidate the genetic regulatory grammar in the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and to prioritize genetic variants in psychiatric disorders. Specifically, we will (1) dissect the cis- regulatory landscape of the PFC using population-scale epigenetics data, (2) construct multi- model gene regulatory networks by linking distal cis-regulatory elements to genes using chromatin co-variability analyses, (3) integrate genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional data to identify key transcription factors and variants that contribute to psychiatric disorders. Distinct from existing efforts focusing on one genome, this proposed work presents a truly novel big-data approach for both modeling gene regulation and investigating disease-risk factors by incorporating heterogeneous multi-omics profiles from hundreds of individuals. The resultant comprehensive list of cis-regulatory elements will expand the number of known functional regions in the human brain by at least an order. We will release our methods and resources in the form of web services, distributed open-source software, and annotation databases, which will also benefit other investigators exploring the genetic underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders.  In addition to its scientific content, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in computational genomics and neurogenetics. This training will take place at Yale University (in the Dept. of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry) under the mentorship of Prof. Mark Gerstein (functional genomics), Prof. Nenad Sestan (neurogenetics), and Prof. Hongyu Zhao (statistical genetics and machine learning). A committee of experienced psychiatric disease experts and data scientists will also provide advice on both scientific research and career development. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to discover cis- regulatory elements in the noncoding genome by incorporating novel functional characterization technologies (such as STARR-seq) with genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data from psychiatric patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely on a single genome, this work assumes a dynamic regulatory program in each individual and explores the regulatory heterogeneity across hundreds of epigenomes, thereby significantly expanding our current knowledge of the noncoding genome and facilitating functional interpretation of genetic variants. Furthermore, it will also generate publicly available annotation resources and software packages for the scientific community, thereby significantly accelerating the pace of novel therapeutic target discovery for treating psychiatric disorders.",A big data approach to explore epigenetic heterogeneity and interpret noncoding variants for psychiatric disorders,10039384,K01MH123896,"['genomic

"Integrate gene expression data to characterize the contribution of rare genetic risk factors to structural birth defects Project Summary  We aim to maximize discovery of new risk genes and elucidate the genetic architecture of structural birth defects. To achieve that, we propose cross-disease genetic analysis of both protein-coding and noncoding variants and integration of gene expression data to prioritize candidate risk genes.  Better understanding of the genetic basis of structural birth defects will lead to new insights into human developmental biology and will provide targets for medical intervention and treatment. Recent large-scale genome and exome sequencing studies of birth defects have identified new risk genes, especially through the analysis of de novo variants in protein coding regions. However, we are still far from complete understanding of the genetic causes of birth defects. Estimates are that there are 400- 800 risk genes of large effect size for birth defects such as congenital heart disease, and the vast majority of these genes are unknown. This is primarily due to the lack of statistical power. While increasing sample size is essential and is part of the core deliverables of the Gabriella Miller Kids First (GMKF) programs, we also need to develop and apply new analytical methods that improve power and maximize the utility of the available genetic data by using other types of data and biological knowledge. In addition, in most prior studies, the analysis of rare genetic variation has been focused on small variants in the coding regions or large copy number variants (CNV). The data and methods to interrogate the contribution of rare noncoding variants is rudimentary, limiting our understanding of genetic architecture of these diseases. In this study, we propose two aims to address these questions by leverage GMKF cross-disease whole genome sequencing data sets: Specific Aim 1. Elucidate genetic architecture by cross-disease analysis of rare coding and non-coding variants. Specific Aim 2. Integrate gene expression with genome sequencing data to improve discovery and biological interpretation of risk genes of structural birth defects.  The proposed study will maximize the genetic discovery potential of the GMKF WGS data sets for birth defects and improve our understanding of the pleiotropic effects and tissue specificity of risk genes and variants. The analytical approaches developed in this study will be applicable to genetic data of birth defects and developmental disorders from future GMKF cohorts and other programs. Project Narrative We propose to analyze whole genome sequencing data from the Gabriella Miller Kids First cohorts using new computational approaches that maximize the risk gene discovery and improve interpretation of candidate genes.

"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,9872026,R01GM125639,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Crystallization ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Phenotype ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Genetic Recombination ', ' DNA Recombination ', ' Recombination ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Site-Directed Mutagenesis ', ' Site-Specific Mutagenesis ', ' Targeted DNA Modification ', ' Targeted Modification ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' mutant ', ' success ', ' Free Energy ', ' Structure ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Proteomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Homology Modeling ', ' International ', ' Resolution ', ' Scheme ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' Population ', ' Coupling ', ' biological research ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' screening ', ' biophysical model ', ' biophysical approaches ', ' biophysical methodology ', ' biophysical methods ', ' biophysical techniques ', ' Genetic study ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' web portal ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' human interactome ', ' random forest ', ' data pipeline ', ' computational pipelines ', ' ']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,563248,0.09885225456127447
"Biomedical Computing and Informatics Strategies for Infectious Disease Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important goal of infectious disease research is to develop genetic predictors of susceptibility. Our success in this endeavor will depend critically on the informatics methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic and genomic data. The goal of this research program is to develop, evaluate, distribute and support new and novel biomedical computing algorithms and open-source software for identifying combinations of genetic predictors of clinically important infectious disease outcomes. This application will target the growing body of rare genetic variants identified by high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our clinical application will focus on the prediction of antiretroviral response in clinical trials for HIV/AIDS. We propose here a highly innovative Hierarchical Rare Variant Collapsing Machine (HRVCM) algorithm for identifying and collapsing combinations of rare variants across gene regions (AIM 1). We will then integrate these new collapsed HRVCM variables into our popular Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method that will assess them in combination with common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genome-wide association studies or GWAS (AIM 2). Our novel HRVCM-MDR approach will, for the first time, make it possible to assess non-additive interactions among sets of rare and common variants simultaneously in genetic studies of infectious diseases. We will apply these new and novel methods to approximately 13 million rare and common variants from nearly 3000 subjects that participated in an AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) study to evaluate risk for virologic failure with efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens (AIM 3). Finally, we will release all methods as open source to the biomedical research community through our freely available MDR software package (AIM 4). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of this application is to develop innovative new computational methods for the genetic analysis of infectious diseases.

"Tools for Normalizing and Interpreting the Clinical Actionability of Genomic Variants PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The availability of high-throughput, low-cost sequencing has transformed the landscape of biomedical research by dramatically expanding our capacity to interrogate the sequence of the human genome. Consequently, there has been an explosion of biomedical literature describing the role of specific genomic variants and their impact on human diseases. These advances are bringing sequencing into the clinic to shape clinical practice from the patient’s genomic content, a paradigm colloquially referred to as genomic or precision medicine. There remain many obstacles to fully realizing our potential in the era of precision medicine. Among them is a recognized need for robust, well-engineered systems that provide knowledge about genomic variants and their role in disease. Ideally, such systems would provide a comprehensive summary of all knowledge that is relevant to the patient’s unique genomic content. An early bottleneck to realizing precision medicine was that, despite the substantial literature and several established knowledgebases that define interactions between drugs and genes, querying across them was extremely challenging. In response to this need, the Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb, dgidb.org) was developed. Through a combination of automated processing and manual curation, drug-gene interaction information was collected, structured, and connected (normalized) from these diverse sources of data and entered into a database with a user-friendly search interface and an application programming interface (API). However, linking drug and drug-gene interaction concepts across resources remains an extremely challenging task, and aggregated drug-gene interactions are also challenging to represent in a way that highlights the utility of the collected knowledge for precision medicine efforts. This proposal seeks to improve our ability to normalize and interpret drug-gene interactions corresponding to patient genomic variants. We will achieve this goal through two specific aims. First, the DGIdb normalization routines will be improved through incorporation of new content and features. Among these, the DGIdb will support collections of drugs, including combination therapies and drug classes. Also, the DGIdb will have new community submission and curation features, allowing users to incorporate new knowledge into the database. Second, the Variant Interpretation Aggregator database (VIAdb) will be created to normalize knowledge across several disparate sources focused on the clinical interpretations of genomic variants. The VIAdb will operate as a stand-alone web tool and API and will behave as a source of relevant interpretations to DGIdb. Finally, we will develop techniques for automated identification of drug-gene interactions and variant interpretation consensus to assist community curation efforts.

"Computational tools for regulome mapping using single-cell genomic data Project Summary Understanding how genes' activities are controlled is crucial for elucidating the basic operating rules of biology and molecular mechanisms of diseases. Recent innovations in single-cell genomic technologies have opened the door to analyzing a variety of functional genomic features in individual cells. These technologies enable scientists to systematically discover unknown cell subpopulations in complex tissue and disease samples, and allow them to reconstruct a sample's gene regulatory landscape at an unprecedented cellular resolution. Despite these promising developments, many challenges still exist and must be overcome before one can fully decode gene regulation at the single-cell resolution. In particular, current technologies lack the ability to accurately measure the activity of each individual cis-regulatory element (CRE) in a single cell. They also cannot measure all functional genomic data types in the same cell. Moreover, the prevalent technical biases and noises in single-cell genomic data make computational analysis non-trivial. With rapid growth of data, lack of computational tools for data analysis has become a rate-limiting factor for effective applications of single-cell genomic technologies.  The objective of this proposal is to develop computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory landscape using single-cell genomic data. Our Aim 1 addresses the challenge of accurately measuring CRE activities in single cells using single-cell regulome data. Regulome, deﬁned as the activities of all cis-regulatory elements in a genome, contains crucial information for understanding gene regulation. The state-of-the-art technologies for mapping regulome in a single cell produce sparse data that cannot accurately measure activities of individual CREs. We will develop a new computational framework to allow more accurate analysis of individual CREs' activities in single cells using sparse data. Our Aim 2 addresses the challenge of collecting multiple functional genomic data types in the same cell. We will develop a method that uses single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), the most widely used single-cell functional genomic technology, to predict cells' regulatory landscape. Since most scRNA-seq datasets do not have accompanying single-cell data for other -omics data types, our method will also signiﬁcantly expand the utility and increase the value of scRNA- seq experiments. Our Aim 3 addresses the challenge of integrating different data types generated by different single-cell genomic technologies from different cells. We will develop a method to align single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell regulome data to generate an integrated map of transcriptome and regulome.  Upon completion of this proposal, we will deliver our methods through open-source software tools. These tools will be widely useful for analyzing and integrating single-cell regulome and transcriptome data. By addressing several major challenges in single-cell genomics, our new methods and tools will help unleash the full potential of single-cell genomic technologies for studying gene regulation. As such, they can have a major impact on advancing our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases. Project Narrative Understanding how genes' activities are controlled at single-cell resolution is crucial for studying human diseases. This proposal will develop a coordinated set of computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory programs using single-cell genomic data.

"IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset PROJECT SUMMARY Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are complex genetic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, and a major health burden to patients and society. Tremendous progress has been made in dissecting IBD genetic etiology with identification of over 200 IBD loci by genome wide association studies (GWAS) but mainly limited to persons of European ancestry. The IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established to facilitate multicenter collaborative studies of 6 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) organized with a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Our GRC at Johns Hopkins (JHGRC) has contributed to all IBDGC studies, meeting recruitment objectives and taking roles in IBDGC leadership positions. Our particular focus is on African American (AA) IBD genetics. We performed the first large-scale evaluation of European loci in the AA population, replicating several genes, but also finding unique African-ancestral variants within these loci, as well as identified multiple admixture significant loci. We also published the first AA IBD genome-wide association study (GWAS), a collaborative effort that identified two African-specific gene loci, and replicated multiple additional European loci. We have also explored why some loci with proven risk variants in Europeans and other populations only cause disease in one ancestral population but not others. More research in AA IBD is needed to understand the etiology of IBD in this ancestrally distinct, major American population. In this application we will re-evaluate the AA GWAS by better imputation, evaluate whole genome sequencing data to test low frequency and rare variants, and perform an evaluation for chromosome X variants. We will recruit a large number of AA IBD patients through our own and multiple Satellite Recruitment Centers to power a second AA IBD GWAS, both UC and CD, and meta-analyze with the first to identify more novel loci, identify more African specific risk variants, and replicate known loci for this population and replicate our admixture loci. We will also incorporate diverse data sources to incorporate into our GWAS analyses including RNA-Seq currently being generated on lymophoblastoid cell lines from AA CD cases and controls, and RNA-Seq that we will generate in colonic biopsies from UC cases and controls. We will evaluate chromatin differences and expression of genes in cell types relevant to IBD from European, AA and East Asian ancestries in an effort to better understand locus heterogeneity by ancestry. We will continue to participate in all IBDGC activities to maximize the Impact of IBD genetics research by this cooperative funding mechanism. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.4 million Americans suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a chronic debilitating disorder with no cure that includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD ranks in the top 5 in prevalence for gastrointestinal disorders and represents a significant financial burden to society requiring a lifetime of medical care. This proposed research aims to determine the genetic variations that cause IBD which will aid in developing preventive measures, improving the quality of care with better treatments and educating patients through genetic counseling.",IBD Gene Mapping by Clinical and Population Subset,10001511,U01DK062431,"['Algorithms ', ' Biopsy ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', '

"Epilepsy Multiplatform Variant Prediction (EpiMVP) The advent of next generation DNA sequencing has revolutionized gene discovery in human diseases, including epilepsy. Hundreds of genes have been implicated in epilepsy in the last decade, revealing the diversity of biological mechanisms that can go awry in this disorder. However, the rate at which we are identifying new genes involved in epilepsy is now outpacing our ability to study disease mechanisms. Moreover, clinical gene panel or exome sequencing has become standard practice for patients with early-onset, familial, and refractory epilepsies. This rapid assimilation of genetic testing into clinical care has led to a surge in the number of genetic variants of uncertain significance (VUS), particularly the occurrence of missense VUS. These VUS are assigned to an indeterminate spectrum between pathogenic and benign, which complicate interpretation for genetic counselors, clinicians, patients and families, as well as assessment of the need for further testing. Here we propose a Center without Walls, entitled Epilepsy Multiplatform Variant Prediction (EpiMVP), spanning 5 institutions and incorporating expertise from geneticists, clinicians, computational biologists, neuroscientists, stem cell biologists, pharmacologists and electrophysiologists who have a proven track record of collaborative publications and grants, as well as stature as leaders of national and international epilepsy organizations. EpiMVP will develop a modular, highly integrated platform approach to accelerate determination of the functional, pharmacological, neuronal network and whole animal consequences of genetic variants implicated in a range of clinical epilepsy types. We will study non-ion-channel, non-receptor genes commonly implicated in epilepsy, and that are involved in diverse biological processes. Our ultimate goals are to devise an effective experimental platform for testing the pathogenicity of VUS in genes implicated in epilepsy and to generate a computational model (EpiPred) that predicts the likelihood that a variant is pathogenic or benign. This work is crucial in the pursuit of novel therapeutics and the promise of personalized medicine. The overall milestones of the Center are: 1. Evaluate genes associated with epilepsy and select candidates for analysis, model data for, and analyze all project data for development of EpiPred an iterative machine learning model to classify variants in genes implicated in epilepsy. 2. Test selected VUS using medium throughput, in vitro approaches. 3. Test selected VUS in human cortical neurons or human brain organoids using induced pluripotent stem cell approaches. 4. Test selected VUS in pre-clinical, in vivo models. The expected outcomes are: 1. Provide a freely available prediction tool for clinicians to differentiate between pathogenic and benign variants for genes implicated in epilepsy; 2. Provide experimental models to study the functional consequences of specific variants; 3. Provide a reclassification of VUS in ClinVar/ClinGen and to develop new guidelines for incorporating functional readouts into the ACMG criteria; 4. Inform the future development of novel therapeutics to treat epilepsy.

"Leveraging Common Fund data for feature selection in Kids First studies. Project Abstract This project will pilot a process for identifying multi-variant interactions contributing structural birth defect and childhood cancer disorders. This study will focus on analysis of oral-facial clefts, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and congenital heart defects from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from family cohorts taken from Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Project (KF).  Typically, tests to link disorders to genome-wide complex multivariate associations are computationally prohibitive. Thus, a first step to making such analyses more reasonable is to limit the number of variables (genes, variants) being tested together. We can reduce the number of possible tests by restricting what data should be tested. This study will seek to reduce the data for testing by utilizing biological knowledge from other two Common Fund datasets: the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. KOMP2 has generated extensive information on mouse knockout developmental phenotypes relevant for matching gene and phenotypes in KF WGS studies. GTEx can be merged with KF loci and relevant tissue-to-phenotype relationships. Thus, using features from other Common Fund data and annotations, we can generate selected subsets of KF variants and genes as feature-reduced KF data.  A comprehensive machine learning (ML) analysis pipeline will then be utilized for the identification of candidate risk factors and characterization of complex patterns of association between these feature-reduced KF data. In addition to performing the more traditional univariate association analyses of genotype vs. phenotype, this pipeline will also identify complex associations including (1) context-dependent genetic effects resulting from non-additive multi-variant interactions, i.e. epistasis, and (2) subgroup-specific associations, i.e. by phenotype and genotypic heterogeneity, where different etiological paths lead to the same/similar phenotypes in the selected KF subject group. This pipeline will include feature selection, modeling, and interpretation of multi-variant interactions.  The outcomes of this study will include (1) pipelines for integrating Common Fund data into Kids First datasets, (2) integrated KF-KOMP2-GTEx datasets including cross-species integration, (3) ML pipelines for multi-variant interaction analyses of phenotype vs genotype in selected, reduced-feature KF data, and (4) results from the aforementioned pipelines for multi-variant interactions for later hypothesis testing. Project Abstract This project will pilot a process for identifying interactions between genetic variants that contribute to structural birth defect and childhood cancer disorders by combining data from the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Project with biological knowledge from other two Common Fund datasets: the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project.

"Discovery of diabetes-relevant ÃÂ² cell enhancers through 4D enhancer mapping, integrative analysis, and large-scale CRISPRi perturbation screens ABSTRACT  Enhancers are essential regulatory elements that together with transcription factors (TFs) instruct cell- type specific transcriptional programs during development, tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Initiatives such as the ENCODE project, revealed tens of thousands putative enhancers based on linear proximity, using criteria like chromatin accessibility, TF binding, and histone modifications such as H3K27ac. However, a main challenge of uncovering functional enhancers and assigning them to target genes lies in the complexity of the 3D chromatin organization, which can influence enhancer specificity and activity. Using an advanced chromosome conformation capture assay, we recently captured the dynamic rewiring of 3D enhancer networks during mouse somatic cell reprogramming and discovered multi-connected enhancers that we named “3D enhancer hubs”. Here we extend the 3D mapping approach to human primary islets, and compare islets from healthy and type 2 diabetes (T2D) donors to assemble a 4D atlas to capture the rewiring of 3D enhancer network in disease progression. At the same time, we plan to compare the enhancer network in adult islets to earlier stages of development by using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to generate early β cells and their developmental precursors. Utilizing these 4D genomic data, we will computationally nominate core β-cell specific enhancers relevant to β cell development, function, and T2D, and then interrogate these putative enhancers through large-scale CRISPRi mediated perturbation screens using hPSC-β cells. Enhancers identified from the screening effort will be further validated in an established human β cell line and primary human islet β cells. This proposal addresses a critical gap in the 4DN initiative, that is how to translate 3D genomics data into functional data with respect to gene expression in the context of human health. Successful completion of our aims will establish a paradigm for the discovery and interrogation of functional enhancers that instruct transcriptional programs specific to a cell type of interest, reveal unique insights into their mechanisms of action, and identify enhancers with relevance to human development and disease. For instance, uncovering functional enhancers could assist the identification of noncoding causal variants identified in genome-wide association studies. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE)  This project will take an integrative approach involving generating a 4D atlas of regulatory interactions during both development and disease progressions, computationally nominating diabetes-relevant β cell enhancers through integrative analysis and discovering functional enhancers through large-scale perturbation screens. Knowledge gained from the study will provide a conceptual framework for dissecting gene regulatory networks that instruct the β cell fate and function during development and in diabetic conditions.","Discovery of diabetes-relevant ÃÂ² cell enhancers through 4D enhancer mapping, integrative analysis, and large-scale CRISPRi perturbation screens",10117708,U01DK128852,"['Adult ', ' 21+

"Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX SUMMARY Deficiencies in coagulation factor IX (FIX) cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, while high levels of FIX pose a risk for thrombosis. Thus, genetic variation in the F9 gene encoding FIX can impact bleeding by decreasing FIX expression or activity, or can impact thrombosis by increasing FIX expression or activity. However, when a new DNA variant is discovered in the F9 gene, we typically lack the evidence needed to confidently determine if the variant alters the function of the encoded FIX protein and, if so, how severely. For example, in the national hemophilia genotyping project MyLifeOurFuture, the majority of F9 missense variants (i.e. DNA changes predicted to change a FIX amino acid) discovered in patients with hemophilia B had insufficient evidence to be classified as pathogenic. Functional studies, where a FIX variant’s stability, activity or other properties are evaluated in vitro, can provide strong evidence to inform interpretation of F9 variants. However, traditional functional studies are time- and resource-intensive, so testing the hundreds of F9 variant we have observed so far would be impractical. Evaluating the thousands of possible FIX missense variants we could observe as more individuals are sequenced would be impossible. Instead, we propose a new approach to express and characterize nearly every possible missense variant in the FIX protein to advance our understanding of FIX biology, improve the interpretation of genetic variation in the F9 gene, and advance hemophilia care and treatments. To accomplish this goal, we will employ deep mutational scanning, a method we developed for measuring the effects of massive numbers of missense variants of a protein simultaneously. Here, we will display a library of nearly all possible FIX missense variants tethered to the surface of cultured human cells. We propose to exploit this FIX surface display library in two aims: 1) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on FIX expression and secretion, and 2) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on specific FIX functions including Gla-domain gamma-carboxylation and activation of FIX by factor XIa (FXIa). These aims will reveal how nearly all possible missense variants in FIX impact expression, secretion, gamma- carboxylation, and activation by FXIa. In aim 3, we will use these large-scale functional data to dissect the mechanism by which F9 pathogenic variants disrupt FIX function. We will also use machine learning, leveraging the functional data along with other features to predict pathogenicity for each missense variant in FIX. Taken together, the functional data we generate, the analyses we propose, and tools we build will transform the characterization of F9 variants. They will also serve as a resource to better understand FIX biology, improve the clinical translation of F9 genetic information, and inform new treatments. NARRATIVE DNA changes that affect the F9 gene that makes coagulation factor IX (FIX) can reduce FIX levels and cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, or increase the amount of active FIX and increase the risk of thrombosis. Although hundreds of variants have been detected in the F9 gene, there is often insufficient information to know how any one specific change will affect the protein, if that change will cause disease, or how severe disease will likely be. We will use new technologies to study the consequences of every possible amino acide change in FIX, with the goal of developing the information needed to understand the significance of new genetic changes as they are discovered in the future and to improve the care and treatment of patients.",Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX,9946710,R01HL152066,"['Affect ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Antibodies ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Coagulation Disorders ', ' Coagulation Disorder ', ' Coagulopathy ', ' bleeding disorder ', ' clotting disorder ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Hemophilia B ', ' Christmas Disease ', ' Factor IX Deficiency ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Factor IX ', ' Autoprothrombin II ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IX ', ' Christmas Factor ', ' Coagulation Factor IX ', ' EC 3.4.21.22 ', ' Factor IX Complex ', ' Factor IX Fraction ', ' Plasma Thromboplastin Component ', ' antihemophilic factor B ', ' thromboplastinogen B ', ' Factor XIa ', ' Activated Blood Coagulation Factor XI ', ' Activated Factor XI ', ' Coagulation Factor XIa ', ' Contact Activation Product ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Fluorescent Antibody Technique ', "" Coon's Technic "", "" Coon's Technique "", ' Fluorescent Antibody Technic ', ' Fluorescent Antinuclear Antibody Test ', ' Immunofluorescence Technic ', ' Immunofluorescence Technique ', ' fluorescent antibody ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Hemophilia A ', ' Factor VIII Deficiency ', ' Hemophilia ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hemostatic function ', ' Hemostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thrombosis ', ' thrombotic disease ', ' thrombotic disorder ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' carboxylation ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' mutant ', ' Structure ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Cell surface ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' F9 gene ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Cell ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' gain of function ', ' High-Throughput DNA Sequencing ', ' genetic information ', ' Genetic study ', ' mutation scanning ', ' mutation screening ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' clinical translation ', ' ']",NHLBI,BLOODWORKS,R01,2020,418577,0.19525697294701214
"Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in cancer[1], common disease[2]and rare disease diagnosis.[3] Despite their success, our ability to fully interpret the clinical relevance of personal genome variation remains a significant gap[4-6]. Considering this, the most crucial need is more genotype-phenotype data that link genetic variation with disease causation. The objective of this proposal is to improve the clinical interpretation of genetic variation; in particular, by developing integrative approaches that predict the effect of genetic variation on clinical phenotype. This proposal addresses the hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, that combining patient transcriptomic data with genotypic and clinical data (as opposed to each alone) offers a better mechanistic understanding of disease natural history, from initial presentation to progression. The specific aims are designed such that each independently add substantial functional genomic information, over and above previously available patient genetic data, to further resolve the clinical phenotype. Aim 1 establishes a comprehensive and widely-shared dataset of patient transcriptomic (and genetic) variation across multiple cancer, cardiovascular and thrombosis/bleeding phenotypes, in patients with somatically-acquired myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and select other rare heritable blood diseases (HBD). Aim 2 methodically determines differential RNA expression and processing between clinically-relevant subgroups of MPN and HBD patients. Aim 3 brings these elements together – and applies two integrative Bayesian and machine learning approaches, RIVER[24] (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation) and LASSO[25] (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), to resolve the functional and clinical relevance of rare variants; and identify signatures most predictive of disease risk or progression. Completion of these aims will contribute new scientific knowledge on how integrating transcriptomic data improves clinical genomic analyses in other genetic (and rare) diseases. In addition, this project will enable the Principal Investigator to develop expertise in the informatics and data science aspects of genomic medicine that complement her current background in biophysics, biochemistry and translational hematology. Combined with additional informatics training at Stanford University through coursework, seminars, one-on-one advising from project mentors, and interactions with the wider statistics, bioinformatics and genomics communities, this project will prepare the Principal Investigator to launch an independent academic career in genomic medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate clinical interpretation of genetic variation in personal genome data is an essential component of personalized medicine approaches and the precise genetic diagnosis toward achieving improved public health. This project will integrate genetic and clinical modifiers with functional genomic information (RNA sequencing) from adequately-powered, disease-relevant cells; and provide direct insight into

"Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and disease PROJECT DESCRIPTION While accurate annotations of protein-coding regions in the human genome have been available for many years, annotation and interpretation of regulatory sequences has lagged far behind. This is because—in contrast to protein-coding sequences—the “rules” that govern links from genome sequence to regulatory function are fuzzy, complex, and highly context-specific. Our limited understanding of regulatory regions presents a fundamental challenge for the identification and interpretation of disease variation, especially in the context of personal genome interpretation. Work from ENCODE and other groups has started to close this gap through experimental work, including high-resolution maps of regulatory sites in a variety of cell types, and modeling of the cell-type specific mappings from genome sequence to regulatory function. In this project we will develop a suite of new tools that uses these diverse new data sets to tackle these problems. We will implement and apply powerful new machine learning methods (based on deep learning) to interpret the genomic, context-specific encoding of regulatory information, and to identify genetic variants that impact the encoded information. We will build models using data from a variety of sources including ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GTEx, regulatory variation in the HapMap cell lines, as well as from disease cohorts. Validation experiments will be performed using a new high-complexity CRISPR/Cas9 system developed by our team. We will develop software tools and analytical results that can be widely used for genome interpretation, especially in analysis of personal genomes. By the end of this study we expect to have: (1) developed powerful new computational models for predicting regulatory function in a wide variety of cell types, at unprecedented resolution; (2) implemented novel validation screens in native chromatin at extremely high throughput; and (3) developed new tools for interpreting common and rare regulatory variation, with particular focus on identification of high-impact regulatory mutations in personal genomes. We are committed to timely release of software, data and analysis and are committed to working with the ENCODE Consortium to increase the impact of data and analyses from all study sites. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this project is to develop powerful new computational methods to understand and predict the identity and function of gene regulatory sequences in diverse cell types. We will use these new methods to help us interpret common and rare genetic variation, and to identify variants that may contribute to disease. Outputs from the project will include new methods, software and functional validation data.","Decoding the regulatory architecture of the human genome across cell types, individuals and

"Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome Abstract My research aims to understand the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in gene regulation. This involves studying associations among genotype, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, non-coding RNAs, chromatin interactions and gene expression. In order to transform this genome-wide information into new biological discoveries, my laboratory develops scalable and interpretable computational methods based on statistics, graph theory and machine learning. Our recent focus is to address an important gap in the current knowledge of the role of 3D chromatin structure in gene regulation. That is, we aim to define how genotypic variation affects 3D organization of gene promoters, and in turn, their expression. To achieve this at a genome- wide scale is an ambitious goal, because it requires having at a minimum, genotype, gene expression and chromatin interaction profiles in pure populations of specific cell types from a large number of donors. However, my laboratory is uniquely positioned to perform this research because: i) we are involved in a study at the La Jolla Institute (LJI-R24AI108564) that has already genotyped ~100 donors and expression-profiled more than 15 different pure populations of human immune cell types, and we have access to the same samples for chromatin interaction mapping, ii) in collaboration with other groups at LJI, we have already discovered a prototypical example of an interaction quantitative trait locus (iQTL) that alters and rewires interactions from the promoter of a specific gene that is associated with asthma susceptibility, iii) we have the necessary expertise and proven track record in experimental design and computational analyses of various chromatin conformation capture assays. Leveraging the resources available at LJI and our expertise in the field, we will build a unique research program around the novel concept of iQTLs. The emerging set of three main questions we propose to address within the next five years are: Q1) How do we define cell-type-specific iQTLs for common genetic variants? Q2) What is the extent of overlap between iQTLs and GWAS SNPs? Q3) Can we build predictive models for the cell-type specificity of chromatin interactions and iQTLs? Although we propose to define iQTLs only in two abundant, easily accessible, and highly disease-relevant immune cell types, the concept of iQTLs is equally important in other cell types implicated in diseases with a genetic component. Hence, the proof-of-concept developed by this work, without a doubt, will open up a new field in studying a previously uncharacterized role for disease-susceptibility variants, specifically non-coding SNPs, from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gene regulation. Narrative Recent discoveries that allow us to look beyond the one-dimensional sequence of DNA and understand the large-scale organization principals of its three-dimensional folding have been limited when it comes to characterizing the role of fine-scale genetic variations of the DNA code in controlling important cellular processes such as gene expression. This work will employ state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques and develop novel computational methods to define the role of such genetic variants in changing three-dimensional connections made by the promoters of genes in the human genome. This systematic and unbiased genome- wide study will have important implications in changing the way we study the disease relevance of genetic variation by revealing genotype dependence of long-range chromatin interactions between genes and their distal control switches at a scale that has not been achieved to date.",Defining interaction quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) in the human genome,9980439,R35GM128938,"['Affect ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Chromatin ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' Diathesis ', ' liability to disease ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Dependence ', ' cell type ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' histone modification ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Molecular Biology Techniques ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Gene Organization ', ' Gene Structure/Organization ', ' genes structure ', ' Gene Structure ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Population ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' predisposing gene ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' graph theory ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' chromatin conformation capture ', ' chromosome capture ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' ']",NIGMS,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R35,2020,449649,0.057334968924630206
"Computational Inference of Regulatory Network Dynamics on Cell Lineages Regulatory networks that control which genes are expressed when, are critical players in the maintenance and transitions of different cell states. In mammalian systems such networks are established by a complex interplay of thousands of regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, chromatin remodelers and signaling proteins, histone post-translational modifications and three-dimensional organization of the genome. Hence, the identification of genome-scale regulatory networks and their changes remains a computational and experimental challenge, especially for rare and novel cell types. Through recent efforts of consortia projects we now have rich datasets measuring multiple components of the regulation machinery in model cell lines. These data enable the creation of a more complete regulatory network for these cell lines. Can we use this information to identify networks in new cell types where measuring only a few components of the regulation machinery is possible (e.g. the transcriptome)? Can we leverage more complete regulatory networks to predict new cell types, and to predict the effect of network perturbations to cellular state? To tackle these questions, in this proposal we will develop innovative network reconstruction methods to identify regulatory networks in novel and rare cell types by leveraging their relationships to well-studied cell types, as well as to each other. Our methods will use the framework of non-stationary graphical models to represent cell type-specific regulatory networks and will use multi-task learning to incorporate shared information between cell types in a lineage. Methods in Aim 1 will infer modular gene regulatory networks for each cell type and additionally refine an existing incomplete or uncertain lineage structure. Methods in Aim 2 will identify cell type-specific directed dependencies among chromatin state and transcription factors and how they impact target gene expression through proximal and long-range regulation. Our methods will be applied to two cell-fate specification problems: cellular reprogramming and multi-cell lineage forward differentiation. In cellular reprogramming, regulators and subnetworks hindering reprogramming efficiency will be predicted and tested using genetic perturbation experiments. In forward differentiation, regulatory network changes that drive alternate lineages will be identified and tested. Successful completion of this project will provide two broadly applicable software tools that will enable researchers to (i) accurately identify regulatory networks and their changes between different cell states in complex cell lineages, (ii) examine interactions among multiple levels of regulation and their impact on cell type-specific gene expression, and (iii) efficiently identify the most upstream regulatory genes and subnetworks that change cellular states. Software tools from this project will be made available and will be broadly applicable to diverse types of dynamic biological processes in development and disease. Project Narrative Many human diseases are due to aberrant activity of genes in specific cell types. Transcriptional regulatory networks specify what genes must be expressed in which cell types and play a central role in the type and function of cells. Therefore, the ability to identify these networks in each cell type and the network changes that result in changes in cell type is important for a better understanding of human health and disease.

"Massively parallel dissection of psychiatric regulatory networks ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal neuronal development can lead to a wide array of mental disorders. Genes important for neurodevelopment have been combed for coding mutations leading to psychiatric disease with limited success, suggesting that other regions in the genome could be causative. A variety of molecular and clinical data indicates that mutations associated with psychiatric disease can reside in gene regulatory sequences such as enhancers. However, only a few enhancers have been definitively linked with these disorders to date. This is primarily because regulatory mutations are challenging to functionally characterize and link to specific genes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we will use functional genomics data, sequence motifs, and evolutionary signatures to train EnhancerFinder, software that we developed that predicts functional enhancers at high success rates, to now specifically identify active neurodevelopmental enhancers. Over 12,000 candidate neurodevelopmental enhancers will then be cloned and assayed en masse for their enhancer activity using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in three human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived neuronal lines: early initiation, neural progenitor cell stage that produces only neurons upon further differentiation, and astrocytes. In addition, we will link enhancers to their target genes using a novel chromatin structure-based prediction approach, called TargetFinder, thereby establishing a network connecting regulatory regions to neurodevelopmental genes. By overlaying reproducible psychiatric disease associated loci with this network, we will identify and prioritize non-coding mutations that are likely to affect expression of neurodevelopmental genes with roles in psychiatric disease. These predictions will be validated using genome- editing techniques to knock out regulatory elements and then assay changes in chromatin interactions and gene expression in developing neurons. The key innovations of our approach are: (i) accurate, quantitative measurements of activity for thousands of psychiatric disease associated enhancer candidates in parallel, (ii) chromatin based inference of gene regulatory networks linking enhancer mutations to genes and pathways, and (iii) a well-characterized stem cell based system to apply these techniques in a high-throughput manner to developing human neurons. We will rapidly disseminate software, reagents, protocols, and datasets to enable follow-up functional studies in the labs of our mental health collaborators and many others. Our long-term aim is to pinpoint causative regulatory variants in the many genomic loci associated with psychiatric disease where an obvious coding mutation is lacking. This approach could easily be adapted to functionally characterize gene regulatory elements involved in other complex human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite a wide variety of molecular and clinical data suggesting that psychiatric disease can be caused by mutations in gene regulatory elements such as enhancers that control when and where genes turn on and off during neuronal development, only a few such mutations have been identified thus far. In this project, we will use advanced computational tools to predict neurodevelopmental enhancers and their gene targets, plus a technique called massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to functionally test thousands of these predictions en masse in human embryonic stem cell derived neuronal cell lines. We will then identify and functionally characterize disease associated DNA variants in these validated enhancers that disrupt their normal gene regulatory functions in neuronal development.",Massively

"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches. Computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data produced for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers and genetic disorders. The proposed studies aim to address new challenges arising from the latest sequencing data and to develop faster and more accurate solutions to existing applications. The success of this proposal is likely to unlock the full power of recent sequencing technologies in disease studies and will dramatically reduce the cost of data analyses.",Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data,9870944,R01HG010040,"['Algorithms ', ' Attention ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Maps ', ' Modernization ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Running ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Sequence Alignment ', ' sequencing alignment ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Genetic ', ' lightweight ', ' light weight ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' high throughput analysis ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Large-Scale Sequencing ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' deep sequencing ', ' cost ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Advanced Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' nano pore ', ' nanopore ', ' mammalian genome ', ' user-friendly ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' open source ', ' genome analysis ', ' High-Throughput Sequencing ', ' High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' preservation ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' deep learning ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' contig ', ' ']",NHGRI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2020,397125,0.03843626670350099
"TOOLS FOR NORMALIZING AND INTERPRETING THE CLINICAL ACTIONABILITY OF GENOMIC VARIANTS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The availability of high-throughput, low-cost sequencing has transformed the landscape of biomedical research by dramatically expanding our capacity to interrogate the sequence of the human genome. Consequently, there has been an explosion of biomedical literature describing the role of specific genomic variants and their impact on human diseases. These advances are bringing sequencing into the clinic to shape clinical practice from the patient’s genomic content, a paradigm colloquially referred to as genomic or precision medicine. There remain many obstacles to fully realizing our potential in the era of precision medicine. Among them is a recognized need for robust, well-engineered systems that provide knowledge about genomic variants and their role in disease. Ideally, such systems would provide a comprehensive summary of all knowledge that is relevant to the patient’s unique genomic content. An early bottleneck to realizing precision medicine was that, despite the substantial literature and several established knowledgebases that define interactions between drugs and genes, querying across them was extremely challenging. In response to this need, the Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb, dgidb.org) was developed. Through a combination of automated processing and manual curation, drug-gene interaction information was collected, structured, and connected (normalized) from these diverse sources of data and entered into a database with a user-friendly search interface and an application programming interface (API). However, linking drug and drug-gene interaction concepts across resources remains an extremely challenging task, and aggregated drug-gene interactions are also challenging to represent in a way that highlights the utility of the collected knowledge for precision medicine efforts. This proposal seeks to improve our ability to normalize and interpret drug-gene interactions corresponding to patient genomic variants. We will achieve this goal through two specific aims. First, the DGIdb normalization routines will be improved through incorporation of new content and features. Among these, the DGIdb will support collections of drugs, including combination therapies and drug classes. Also, the DGIdb will have new community submission and curation features, allowing users to incorporate new knowledge into the database. Second, the Variant Interpretation Aggregator database (VIAdb) will be created to normalize knowledge across several disparate sources focused on the clinical interpretations of genomic variants. The VIAdb will operate as a stand-alone web tool and API and will behave as a source of relevant interpretations to DGIdb. Finally, we will develop techniques for automated identification of drug-gene interactions and variant interpretation consensus to assist community curation efforts. If successful, this research will improve breadth and consistency of variant interpretations and drug-gene interactions for precision medicine efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will improve our ability to interpret genomic variations in human patients in support of precision medicine efforts. Specifically, it will provide web-based tools for identifying potential therapies that specifically target the patient’s individual genes or variants, and an assessment of the clinical actionability of those drugs.",TOOLS FOR NORMALIZING AND INTERPRETING THE CLINICAL ACTIONABILITY OF GENOMIC VARIANTS,9938666,K99HG010157,"['Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combined treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Explosion ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Suggestion ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Level of Evidence ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' gene interaction ', ' cohort ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' drug resource ', ' Data ', ' Resource Development ', ' VICC ', ' The Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center at the Vanderbilt University ', ' Collection ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' model of data ', ' model the data ', ' modeling of the data ', ' data modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' cancer type ', ' user-friendly ', ' web interface ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' tumor ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' genomic variation ', ' clinically actionable ', ' application program interface ', ' application programming interface ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' individual patient ', ' patient profile ', ' profiles in patients ', ' web application ', ' web app ', ' therapeutic marker ', ' therapeutic biomarker ', ' web-based tool ', ' Visualization ', ' ']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,18900,0.13951229590253622
"Novel statistical methods and tools to integrate multiple endophenotypes and functional annotation data to study the roles of rare variants in complex human diseases using sequencing data Project Summary In the past fifteen years, great efforts have been made to understand the genetic architecture of complex human diseases through genome-wide association studies. Although many genome-wide significant variants have been identified, the heritability or variance explained by these variants remains very small, suggesting substantial missing heritability that may yet be explained by common genetic variants with smaller effect sizes and/or rare and low frequency variants, which calls for the development and application of novel statistical methods to whole genome/exome sequencing data collected from deeply phenotyped cohorts. In this project, we will develop methods that leverage multiple correlated endophenotypes and further integrate functional annotation data to identify novel rare variants for complex traits. We will develop a set of new computational and analytical tools that are practically useful and broadly applicable to general sequencing studies, and the applications of our methods will likely identity novel rare variant associations and shed new lights on the genetics of cardiometabolic diseases. In Aim 1, we propose to develop novel statistical methods to integrate multiple endophenotypes to study the impact of rare variants on complex human diseases. Our methods will fill in the gap between the current practice of association studies and the practical needs of integrating endophenotypes for improved understanding and diagnosis of clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, we will extend the methods to meta-analyses across studies. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel kernel machine learning approach to integrating various functional information to annotate the whole genome region, and further integrate them to develop a dynamic whole-genome scan test to detect rare variant associations with multiple endophenotypes. We will leverage the NHLBI TOPMed whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and the UK Biobank whole exome sequencing (WES) data, and integrate the functional annotation data to identify and dissect the role of rare variants on the cardiometabolic traits (Aim 4). Our proposed work is cost-effective as it leverages the existing WGS/WES samples and functional annotation data while providing methods and tools that are broadly applicable to other studies, and builds on a strong team of scientists with proven track record in statistical genetics, large-scale genetic studies, and cardiometabolic traits. We expect our methods will lead to the discoveries of many more rare and low frequency variants for these traits. These results will offer new insights to help design more effective treatment and prevention strategies. All our proposed methods will be disseminated to the public through well-tested and publicly available software (Aim 5). Project Narrative We will develop statistical methods and computational software to analyze whole genome/exome sequencing data by integrating multiple phenotypes and functional annotations to identify novel genes associated with cardiometabolic diseases and allow researchers to better disentangle the impacts of rare variants on these complex human diseases.

"Scalable detection and interpretation of structural variation in human genomes PROJECT SUMMARY Structural variation (SV), is a diverse class of genome variation that includes copy number variants (CNVs) such as deletions and duplications, as well as balanced rearrangements, such as inversions and reciprocal translocations. A typical human genome harbors >4,000 SVs larger than 300bp and their large size increases the potential to delete or duplicate genes, disrupt chromatin structure, and alter expression. Despite their prevalence and potential for phenotypic consequence, SVs remain notoriously difficult to detect and genotype with high accuracy. Much of this difficulty is driven by the fact DNA sequence alignment “signals” indicating SVs are far more complex than for single-nucleotide and insertion deletion variants. Unlike SNP alignments that vary only in allele state, alignments supporting SVs vary in state (supports an alternate structure or not) alignment location, and type. Consequently, the accuracy of SV discovery is much lower than that of SNPs and INDELs. Furthermore, SV pipelines scale poorly and are difficult to run. These challenges are a barrier for single genome analysis and studies of families must invest substantial effort into eliminating a sea of false positives. These problems become exponentially more acute for large-scale sequencing efforts such as TOPmed, the Centers for Common Disease Genetics, and the All of Us program. Software efficiency is key to scalability for such projects. However, of equal importance is comprehensive, accurate discovery.  Building upon more than a decade of software development experience and analyzing SV in diverse disease contexts, we have invested significant effort into understanding the causes of the insufficient accuracy for SV discovery. These efforts, together with our research and development experience in this area, give us unique insight into improving the accuracy and scalability of SV discovery. Our goal is to narrow the accuracy gap between SNP/INDEL variation and structural variation discovery. These developments will empower studies of human genomes in diverse contexts and will therefore have broad impact. Our goals are to: 1. Develop a deep learning model to correct systematic variation in sequence depth. This new machine  learning model will correct systematic biases in DNA sequence depth and dramatically improve the  discovery of deletions and duplications. 2. Improve the speed, scalability, and accuracy of SV detection and genotyping. Using new algorithms,  we will bring the accuracy of SV detection much closer to that of SNP and INDEL discovery and allow  accurate SV discovery to be deployed at scale. 3. Create a map of genomic constraint for SV from population-scale genome analysis. We will deploy  our new methods to detect and genotype structural variation among tens of thousands of human genomes.  The resulting SV map will empower the creation of a model of genomic constraint for SV and enable new  software to predict deleterious SVs, especially in the noncoding genome. PROJECT NARRATIVE Single-nucleotide DNA changes paint an incomplete picture of a human’s genome.

"A database for high-resolution chromatin contact maps and human genetic variants Abstract After the completion of the Human Genome Project, several landmarking consortia have accumulated large amounts of genomic data towards understanding the functions of human genome. The ENCODE project has annotated genome-wide regulatory elements. The Roadmap Epigenomic project has characterized tissue-speciﬁc variation in epigenetic state. The NIH Common Fund GTEx project has delineated tissue-speciﬁc gene expression and transcription regulation. The NIH Common Fund 4D Nucleome (4DN) project has revealed dynamic 3D chromatin organization in many cell and tissue types. Each of the aforementioned consortia has generated thousands or even tens of thousands of datasets, and provided different insights regarding human genome at an unprecedent scale and depth. However, the datasets generated from these consortia are isolated in terms of cell types and tissue types covered, how the data are stored, and the resolution of the genomic data. These gaps bring realistic data analysis challenges to biomedical researchers when they use these public datasets jointly in their research — they need to go through different data portals with heterogeneous processing pipelines, different data formats, and unmatched resolutions. We aim to develop the most cutting-edge deep learning approaches to impute high-resolution chromatin contact maps, and integrate the high-resolution chromatin contact maps with transcriptional data available from GTEx project and epigenomic data from ENCODE/Roadmap. We plan to share the integrated data on a public web server with a multi-panel interactive visualization genome browser. The integrated data will provide an important resource for understanding of tissue-speciﬁc genetic variation in the light of the spatial organization of these genomic and epigenomic elements and their functional implications. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel computational methods to integrate 4DN datasets with GTEx datasets and ENCODE/Roadmap datasets. The integrated datasets will be critical resource to unveil the mechanisms of the genetic variants identiﬁed in genome-wide association studies.

"Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation How do changes in DNA sequence impact organismal properties? This is a central question of modern  biology, and insights into it can help us understand, among other things, why patients respond  differently to the same treatment, or why some species exhibit behavioral properties not seen in  other species. A major hurdle in solving this ‘genotype-to-phenotype’ problem is our poor knowledge  of gene regulatory mechanisms underlying phenotypes and cellular processes, and how those  mechanisms are encoded in DNA. It also leads to severe difficulties in prioritizing  phenotype-linked non-coding variants (polymorphisms) for further investigation. Driven by these  challenges, my lab seeks to develop quantitative frameworks for describing and  discovering transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We have made significant progress towards this  goal in two main directions: (1) We have developed detailed biophysical models of the  cis-regulatory encoding of gene expression. Using these models we have shown how the regulatory  function of transcription factor (TF) binding sites depends on their sequence and DNA shape, as  well as their ‘trans-context’, e.g., cellular concentrations of regulators, and  ‘cis-context’, e.g., proximity to other TF binding sites and chromatin states. (2) We have  devised statistical models to discover TF-gene interactions from transcriptomic data, as well as  other types of ‘omics’ data if available. Working closely with biologists, we have applied these  models to understand phenotypes such as cytotoxic drug response in cell lines, behavioral response  to social encounters, and embryonic development. Building on the strong foundations of our  past work, I propose to establish a research program that studies transcriptional regulation  holistically at the cis- and trans- levels. Our new pursuits will include: (1) use of our  computational, sequence-level models to describe two data-rich mammalian regulatory programs, an  experimental collaboration to dissect the cis-regulatory logic of a key inflammation gene using  massively parallel reporter assays, and major advances in our modeling techniques; (2) new  machine learning methods for reconstructing networks of TF-gene interactions that explain  phenotypic differences, integration of cis- and trans-regulatory evidence from multi-omics  data, and collaborations to apply these methods in cancer pharmacogenomics and behavioral  neurogenomics; (3) a new probabilistic framework to combine traditional statistical scores of a  non-coding variant with quantitative predictions of its regulatory impact based on the  above-mentioned techniques. Explorations of new forms of synergy among these related goals of  network reconstruction, cis-regulatory sequence modeling and variant interpretation will be woven  throughout our research program. The proposed work will answer fundamental questions about molecular mechanisms underlying  phenotypic differences between individuals, such as why different patients respond differently to  the same drug. We will develop new computational methods for discovery of such mechanisms from a  variety of genomics data sets. We will work closely with experimental biologists and use our tools  to study important biological topics including cancer drug response, inflammation, and effect of  estrogen on breast cancer.","Quantitative regulatory genomics: networks, cis-regulatory codes, and phenotypic variation",10021007,R35GM131819,"['Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Chromatin ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Inflammation ', ' Logic ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Modernization ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Research ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Cytotoxic drug ', ' Cytotoxic agent ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' gene interaction ', ' synergism ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Data ', ' Molecular ', ' Behavioral ', ' reconstruction ', ' transcriptomics ', ' biophysical model ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral response ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' neuro-genomics ', ' neurogenomics ', ' multiple omic data ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R35,2020,356979,0.08513007555837135
"A Multivariate Mediation and Deep Learning Framework for Genome-Connectome -Substance Use Research Substance use and addiction are complex biopsychosocial disorders influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. A key challenge in addiction genetics research is to understand how multiple genetic variants interactively influence addiction traits through impacting the central nervous system. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale mediation analysis framework to identify addiction-related gene-brain circuitry pathways, using nicotine addiction as the targeted disorder, although the platform will be readily applicable for other addiction-related disorders and phenotypes. We will fully leverage the complex and interactive interdependent relationships between the imaging-genetics data and perform multivariate statistical inference with simultaneously increased statistical power and reduce false positive rates. The results will precisely identify multiple sets of genetic variants that interactively alter brain functional and structural circuitries, and then influence nicotine addiction. We will further supplement the mediation results with deep learning algorithms to study how genetic variants non-linearly and interactively coordinate to influence nicotine addiction and explain the phenotypic variance. Novel network topology based convolutional and pooling functions will be developed to achieve optimal prediction accuracy of addiction traits using genome-connectome pathways. All models and findings will be carefully validated through multiple independent large-sample data sets of imaging-genetics studies for nicotine addiction for ensuring the replicability and reliability of our findings derived from this framework. We plan to produce a freely available and user-friendly software incorporating the mediation analysis framework and deep learning algorithms enabling the complex whole genome - connectome analysis for addiction genetics research. Nicotine addiction is a worldwide public health priority and imposing health and economic burden on millions of individuals and families.

"Leveraging biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations to understand the genetic architecture of diseases and complex traits Project Summary  Over the past decade, data generated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to analyze heritability of human diseases and complex traits to improve understanding of genetic architecture, including identifying the genetic variants associated with diseases and their effect sizes. These heritability enrichment analyses have revealed underlying biological mechanisms such as regulatory elements involved in disease pathways. This research proposes statistical methods and analysis to formally assess the contribution of biological pathways, gene networks, and re-prioritized functional annotations to the genetic architecture of 94 human diseases and complex traits. Better understanding of disease architecture will improve genome-wide associations and fine mapping and provides robust inference of disease etiology and mechanisms.  The first aim is to determine the contribution of disease-associated gene pathways to disease heritability. It is well known that an abnormality in individual genes rarely causes a human disease. Large-scale pathway analysis will elucidate disease pathways by constructing functional annotations and applying an existing polygenic method to partition heritability. Furthermore, pathway analyses on candidate genes identified via whole-exome sequencing (WES) data will inform new biological inference. The resulting set of enriched pathway-trait pairs will further help with independent validation of previously reported associations and for novel associations enriched for trait heritability.  The second aim is to determine the contribution of gene network to disease heritability across 94 diseases, focusing on hub genes defined by a broad set of network connectivity metrics. The contribution of gene network to disease heritability has been only partially answered, limited to few network connectivity metrics across 42 diseases. Comprehensive analysis of gene sets informed by published gene networks will inform a new direction of integrating gene networks to infer biological mechanisms of human diseases. In addition, visualization method for large-scale gene networks will greatly enhance research translation, serving as a useful resource for studying gene-gene interactions for potential drugs and therapeutic targets.  The third aim is to de-noise and re-prioritize Mendelian annotations to infer candidate genes. Despite considerable process on prioritizing rare variants impacting Mendelian diseases, little is known about the utility of these Mendelian pathogenicity scores for common disease. I will conduct heritability enrichment analyses to answer informativeness of Mendelian disease pathogenicity scores for common disease. To further improve their informativeness, I propose a machine learning variant reprioritization framework. Ultimately, this project will produce (1) a detailed understanding of disease-associated biological pathways to disease heritability, (2) a set of functional annotations informed by gene networks significantly enriched for disease heritability, and (3) a new method to prioritize variants and identifying candidate genes based on diverse genomic features. Project Narrative Understanding human genetic variations, from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to mutations, offers a great potential in uncovering underlying disease mechanisms by identifying new disease-associated genes and in discovering potential drug targets and therapeutics. This proposed studies aim to understand the role of these genetic variations in trait heritability, leveraging disease-associated biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations. The developed method to prioritize variants and genes will answer the contribution of gene pathways, gene sets informed by gene networks, and Mendelian pathogenicity scores to disease heritability.","Leveraging biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations to understand the genetic architecture of diseases and complex traits",9990520,F31HG010818,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Decision Trees ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' gene interaction ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Disease Pathway ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Heritability ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' therapeutic target ', ' exome-seq ', ' exome sequencing ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' genetic architecture ', ' de-noising ', ' denoising ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' Visualization ', ' ']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2020,45520,0.07933753993888265
"lntegration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data PROJECT SUMMARY The onset of most human disease involves numerous molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway, and treatment contexts. This system is probed by thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, and integrative analysis of these data can generate testable hypotheses identifying causal genetic variants and linking them to network level changes in cells to disease phenotypes. This can enable deeper molecular-level understanding of pathophysiology, paving the way to genome-based precision medicine.  The long term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through integrative analysis of high- throughput biological data in a disease context. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration methods, created algorithms for the prediction of disease genes through context-specific and mechanistic network models and analysis of quantitative genetics data, and made novel insights into important biological processes and diseases. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by building public interactive systems capable of real-time user-driven integration that are popular among experimental biologists.  We now propose to connect these gene-level functional network approaches with the underlying genomic variation by deciphering how genomic variants lead to specific transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects. We propose to develop ab initio sequence-level models capable of predicting biochemical effects of any genomic variant (including rare or never observed) on chromatin state and RNA regulation, then link these effects with gene-level regulatory consequences (including tissue-specific transcription and RNA splicing), and finally put genomic sequence directly into the network context via a statistical approach for detecting genes and network neighborhoods with a significantly elevated mutational burden in disease. Our key deliverable will be a user- friendly, interactive web-based framework enabling systems-level variant impact analysis in a network context and an open source library for computational scientists. In addition to systematic analysis across contexts and diseases, we will collaborate with experimentalists to apply our methods to Alzheimer’s, autism spectrum disorders, chronic kidney disease, immune diseases, and congenital heart defects as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to directly contribute to better understanding of these diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE To pave the way for mechanistic interpretation of disease in the genomic context and eventually, precision medicine, we will develop algorithms for de novo prediction of functional biochemical effects of noncoding variants at the DNA regulation and RNA processing levels and then build frameworks for sequence-based prediction of tissue-specific transcription and post-transcriptional RNA processes (starting with splicing). To facilitate discovery of disease mechanisms, we will develop approaches for analyzing these variant effects in a network context, including those developed in the previous grant period (mechanistic and functional networks) and novel network models that integrate exon usage information or enhancer-gene interactions. In addition to verifying top predictions experimentally in our group or by our collaborators in case study areas of neurodegenerative disease, chronic kidney disease, ASD, and congenital heart disease, we will make our methods available to the broader biomedical community through public, interactive user interfaces and open source libraries.",lntegration and Visualization of Diverse

"Discovering Novel Structural Genomic Rearrangements Using Deep Neural Networks Abstract Accurately detecting structural variation in the genome is a challenging task. Many approaches have been developed over the last few decades, yet it is estimated that tens of thousands of variants are still being missed in a given sample. Many of these variants are missed due to the limitations of using short-read sequencing to identify large variants. Although many of these missed variants are located within complex regions of the genome, it has been shown that some still have clinical relevance making their discovery important. New platforms have been developed for sequencing the genome using long-reads and show promise for overcoming many of these limitations creating the ability to identify the full spectrum of simple and complex structural variants. Because this technology is relatively young, new computational approaches to support the analysis of long-read sequencing data can aid in the discovery of these variants which are still being missed. In addition to detecting novel variation in samples with long-read sequencing data, computational approaches can be developed to leverage these novel variant calls to reanalyze the hundreds of thousands of short-read datasets currently available. In this proposal, we plan to develop new computational approaches to identify novel structural variation in the genome. In Aim 1, we will apply a recurrence approach to analyze long read sequencing datasets utilizing deep neural networks. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool to derive profiles of structural variants predicted in long- reads which can be used to identify and genotype structural variants calls in short read data-sets. Together, these approaches will allow researchers to accurately characterize structural variation in both long and short- read datasets.

"Direct measurement of gene-environment interactions by high-throughput precision genome editing Abstract  Modern genetics has identified many genetic variants that affect traits such as height, but most phenotypic variation still cannot be explained by these variants alone. Importantly, differences in environment often result in individual variation of traits—including disease risk and drug response—for different genotypes. These relationships are known as genotype by environment (GxE) interactions. For example, the sickle cell allele of hemoglobin S causes sickle cell anemia, but also provides a fitness advantage in the presence of malaria by conferring resistance to infection. However, there are few examples where the exact causal variants are known. Therefore, we need to develop new methodology for identifying more of these GxE interactions, to improve prediction of disease risk and treatment outcomes.  In this study, I will fill in the gap of knowledge in GxE interactions by establishing an experimental framework for identifying hundreds of causal GxE variants in parallel, providing the first comprehensive view of GxE causal variant landscape. Specifically, I will study how thousands of genetic variants between a laboratory yeast strain (BY) and a vineyard strain (RM) lead to their differences in growth upon stress and drug treatments, as one form of GxE interaction. In Aim 1, I will use a novel gene-editing technology that can detect the fitness effects of thousands of variants in one experiment, as shown in a pilot experiment. Using this method, I will be able to map hundreds of casual variants that contribute to growth differences under various conditions, such as carbon source, oxidative stress and drug treatment. In Aim 2, I will measure allele-specific mRNA expression (ASE) from BYxRM F1 hybrids in above-mentioned conditions and associate the mapped causal GxE variants, to identify GxE variants that influence growth rate through gene expression. Then, I will apply a machine learning model to predict causal GxE genes using the molecular features found in this study. By mapping causal GxE variants, linking them to gene expression and predicting causal genes through gene expression, I will establish a complete framework for accelerating the discovery of GxE interactions. Public Health Relevance The recent explosion of precision medicine based on genotype and mutations has enabled personalized treatment of diseases. However, how environmental factors influence the outcome of such treatments is not clear. By establishing a framework to study general principles and underlying molecular mechanisms of these gene-by-environment interactions, we will be able to integrate such knowledge in disease risk prediction and personalized treatment.",Direct measurement of gene-environment interactions by high-throughput precision genome editing,9905312,F31ES030282,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' sickle disease ', ' sicklemia ', ' Carbon ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Explosion ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Sickle Hemoglobin ', ' Hemoglobin S ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrid Cells ', ' Somatic Cell Hybrids ', ' Hybrids ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Libraries ', ' Malaria ', ' Paludism ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Modernization ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Saccharomyces cerevisiae ', "" Baker's Yeast "", "" Brewer's Yeast "", ' S cerevisiae ', ' S. cerevisiae ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Yeasts ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Lactase ', ' Lactase Enzyme ', ' Lactose Galactohydrolase ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' sickle RBC ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Height ', ' infection resistance ', ' Resistance to infection ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' GxE interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' trait ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Human Cell Line ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Polygenic Characters ', ' Polygenic Inheritances ', ' Polygenic Traits ', ' Meiotic Recombination ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Resolution ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' Molecular ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' Heritability ', ' public health relevance ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' Genetic study ', ' genomic editing ', ' genome editing ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' precise genome editing ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' individual variation ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' causal variant ', ' ']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,29520,0.14659080117230058
"Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract In the United States, the joint disease osteoarthritis (OA) debilitates over one-third of people over sixty-five years old and causes hundreds of thousands of knee replacements annually. Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate knee formation and OA risk and how one inherits risk at specific joints (e.g., knee versus hip). Recent GWAS have identified at least seventeen loci that significantly associate with knee OA risk. However, the casual variants for these loci have not been identified because their association signals span large genomic intervals harboring uninvestigated non-coding regulatory regions. Of these, common variants in the Growth Differentiation Factor Five gene (GDF5), a critical regulator of joint development, reproducibly associate with knee OA risk in human populations. GDF5 OA variants reside on a high frequency 130 kb haplotype possessing numerous mutations that each may be causal for OA risk, but interestingly, no protein coding mutations have been uncovered that explain the associations. In a complementary study, we discovered ten GDF5 regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers) spanning this interval and revealed that they function with tremendous joint specificity (e.g., knee vs. hip). These enhancers were initially tested at incipient stages of GDF5 expression in mouse embryos, but we also know that GDF5 contributes to the differentiation of knee structures (ligaments, tendons, menisci, articular surfaces) well after this stage of development. Our research will bring together knee OA risk variants in patient populations and our knowledge of how GDF5 is controlled at the DNA level. We first aim to assess the functional contributions of joint-specific GDF5 enhancers to pre-natal knee development and adult joint homeostasis using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to excise these elements in vitro in human cells and in vivo in the mouse. Strikingly, our pilot analyses also revealed that a subset of these GDF5 enhancers possesses common and rare human variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with the highest associated OA variants in the interval. Our second aim is to further explore the association between genetic variants in the locus and OA knee shape using data acquired from the complete Osteoarthritis Initiative MR database on adult knees. Our preliminary data reveal that several variants associated with OA knee shape reside in several functional enhancers that control expression of GDF5 in the knee. Finally, our third aim is to functionally test these human regulatory variants for their impact on enhancer activity, knee formation, and OA risk by using transfection studies and CRISPR-Cas9 in human cartilage cells and in the mouse model. Completion of these studies will reveal functional variants in GDF5 that underlie its role in knee shape and OA risk. Project Narrative The Growth Differentiation Factor Five (GDF5) gene is the most reproducibly detected gene region in candidate and genome-wide association studies focusing on knee osteoarthritis risk. The proposed research focuses on (1) assessing the specific functions of key GDF5 regulatory sequences in knee development and cartilage maintenance in mice and humans, (2) the association of genetic variants in GDF5 locus with osteoarthritis knee shape, and (3) the impacts that human GDF5 risk mutations have on chondrocyte and joint biology.",Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind

"Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease. Project Narrative In our proposal we seek to extend the efforts by the ENCODE consortium and others who have made significant strides towards mapping the regulatory landscape of the human genome. We will apply large-scale functional characterization methods to directly test over 3% of the human genome for cis-regulatory activity. In doing so, we will create a resource that will improve our ability to pinpoint regulatory elements in our genome, increase our understanding of how they function, and aid in our ability to link genetic variation to human health and disease.",Comprehensive functional characterization and dissection of noncoding regulatory elements and human genetic variation,9952404,UM1HG009435,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' Elements ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ', ' Inflammatory Bowel Disorder ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disease ', ' Inflammatory Intestinal Disorder ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Logic ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' SLE ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematous ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Catalogs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Amino Acid Substitution ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' trait ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Computational Technique ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' K562 ', ' K562 blasts ', ' K-562 ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Lupus ', ' human disease ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' biological systems ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' Hep G2 ', ' HepG2 cell line ', ' HepG2 ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats method ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats methodology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technique ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' CRISPRi ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats interference ', ' CRISPR interference ', ' CRISPR editing screen ', ' CRISPR-based screen ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 screen ', ' clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats screen ', ' CRISPR screen ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NHGRI,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",UM1,2020,1496387,0.16975207237621465
"Integrative approaches to identification and interpretation of genes underlying psychiatric disorders Psychiatric disorders contribute substantially to the disease burden in the United States and worldwide. There is strong evidence for a genetic contribution to many psychiatric illnesses. In recent years, with the advancement of high throughput genomic technologies and the availability of large samples, remarkable success has been made in risk gene discovery for major psychiatric disorders [e.g., schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD)] through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, due to the high complexity of the human genome, few causal genes or variants have been identified within GWAS risk loci, thus, to date, limiting the potential of translating these genetic findings into biological mechanisms. There is now a great need to pinpoint causal genes/variants at the known GWAS risk loci and to understand their causal mechanisms, as well as to discover novel genes from novel risk loci. There is also growing evidence that risk variants from GWAS tend to be located in regulatory DNA regions in disease-relevant tissues or cell types, suggesting that risk variants may act through regulation of gene expression. Studies leveraging diverse functional genomic resources may benefit psychiatric risk gene discovery and result in better prediction of their biological relevance. This proposal aims to employ highly integrative approaches to identify causal genes and regulatory noncoding variants underlying SCZ, BD, and MDD. Our specific aims are: 1) Integrate GWAS with brain methylome for risk gene discovery, by leveraging a dense high-resolution reference panel of DNAm from whole genome bisulfite sequencing of DNA from three different brain regions (frontal cortex, hippocampus, and caudate) and an enlarged array-based reference panel; 2) Apply a deep learning approach to predicting disease-relevant regulatory variants, by employing features from disease-relevant gene regulatory networks and functional genomic annotations within brain tissues and neural cell types; and 3) Map prioritized genes and variants to specific brain cell types and brain function. We have assembled an outstanding multidisciplinary team with expertise in psychiatric genetics, bioinformatics, machine learning, and neuroimaging. Our goal is to apply multidisciplinary and cutting-edge analytical strategies to help address the challenges arising in the post-GWAS era. The identification and characterization of risk genes and noncoding regulatory variants would help improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie psychiatric illnesses, moving us closer to designing effective prevention and treatment for these disorders. Project Narrative: This proposal takes integrative approaches to prioritizing genes and noncoding variants underlying psychiatric disorders through better leveraging functional genomic resources to predict their biological relevance.

"Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization and 1D epigenome Abstract After the completion of the Human Genome Project, thousands of experiments from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects have successfully proﬁled regulatory elements and epigenetic landscape along the genome. More recently, over 2,000 chromatin organization datasets have been generated from 4D Nucleome (4DN) Project, and they provide complementary information about how these genomic and epigenomic elements are spatially organized in a nucleus. Joint analysis of 3D chromatin organization with previously proﬁled 1D epigenome in different cell types will be a key step to understand the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation over long genomic distances. However, there are two challenges. First, there is a resolution mismatch between chromatin organization data (e.g. Hi-C contacts) which are usually measured at 10k base pair resolution, and epigenome-based chromatin state features (e.g. ChIP-seq peaks) whose signals are usually at tens to hundreds of base pairs. Second, existing computational approaches for analyzing epigenome, such as annotating genome and understanding regulatory elements, all treat the DNA sequence as one-dimensional data, leaving the important 3D structural information unutilized. We aim to develop the most cutting-edge deep learning approaches for understanding the relationship between chromatin state features and chromatin organization, performing 3D and 4D genome annotation, and identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors, respectively. After the completion of the proposed work, we expect to have: (1) an accurate and interpretable computational model to predict chromatin contact maps at nucleosome resolution for a wide range of cell lines, (2) 3D and 4D genome annotations over dynamic chromatin organization, regulatory elements and epigenomic features, and (3) a computational method for identifying spatially collaborative transcription factors which can help us understand the orchestration of noncoding genetic variants. These results will provide fundamental understanding of disease-relevant genetic variation in the light of the spatial organization of these genomic and epigenomic elements and their functional implications. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop novel computational methods to jointly analyze 3D chromatin organization data and 1D epigenomic features, and reveal the interplay among regulatory elements, epigenomic features, and dynamic chromatin organization.

"The fitness effects of de novo structural variants PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) focuses on the training of Dr. PingHsun Hsieh to become an independent investigator of large-scale genomics and human population genetics. Dr. Hsieh is a population geneticist by training, and the proposed studies will advance his training into long-read- based sequencing technologies and novel machine-learning approaches to study the fitness consequences of new mutations, with a focus on structural variants (SVs), in humans and nonhuman primates. Another essential piece will be the development of resources on which types of new SVs are most likely to be pathogenic and hence most worth further effort by medical researchers. The methods developed in this work will enable other researchers to do more hypothesis-free analysis of SVs in disease etiology. Specifically, the training program will center on the study of the distribution of fitness effects of new SVs in human and nonhuman primates using high-quality SV calls and genotypes from several large-scale long- and short-read sequencing projects. The mentored work will take place under the supervision of the primary mentor, Dr. Evan Eichler, and the co-mentor, Dr. Sharon Browning, both at the University of Washington (UW). The mentor and co-mentor are well-established experts in the characterization of genomic variations using high-throughput technologies and the development of stochastic modeling methods for large-scale genetic data, respectively. Dr. Hsieh will also gain advice from a formal advisory committee as well as through activities arranged by the Department of Genome Sciences (GS), which is an optimal place for the mentored training providing the candidate with access to outstanding scientists in areas including genetics of model organisms, disease, population genetics, and the development of high-throughput genomic technologies. While found in nature and yet generally deemed to be deleterious given their size, SVs can be beneficial, and thus, the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new SVs (i.e., the relative frequencies of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious SVs) remains elusive. In the proposed studies, we will infer the DFE of new SVs and other variants to assess their relative importance in nature, which in turn helps prioritize variants (e.g., SVs vs. single- nucleotide variants [SNVs]) in medical genetics. Specifically, in the K99/R00 phases we will (1) infer the DFE of new SVs and SNVs using a diverse panel of ~100 long-read and ~4,000 short-read high-coverage human and nonhuman primate genomes; (2) compare the DFE of new mutations among primates using contemporary and ancient DNA genomes; and (3) study the fitness effects and selective constraints on diseases in different mutation categories in large cohorts of >20,000 genomes. The skills learned in this proposal are on the cutting-edge and are tailored for the candidate to amass a great amount of knowledge in new areas of genomics, which will be applicable to many organisms and diseases and critical to the candidate’s future independent laboratory. NARRATIVE Understanding the relative abundance of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious mutations in different variant categories (e.g., genic vs. intergenic) provides useful guidance and resources for biomedical researchers to prioritize disease-causing mutations and strategize their efforts. To date, however, little effort has been made to study the full spectrum of fitness effects of new structural variants – an important but largely underappreciated genomic variation. The work proposed here seeks to leverage long-read sequencing technologies and develop novel machine-learning approaches to quantify the fitness effects of new mutation, with a focus on structural variants, and subsequently delineate the relative importance among different types of mutations in genetic diseases.",The fitness effects of de novo structural variants,9950314,K99HG011041,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Communities ', ' Demography ', ' Diploidy ', ' Diploid ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Parents ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' pressure ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Public Health ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Natural Selections ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' biomedical resource ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' human population genetics ', ' tech development ', ' technology development ', ' trait ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' high throughput technology ', ' Genomics ', ' Genetic Differentiation ', ' Genetic Divergence ', ' Genetic Drift ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' genome sequencing ', ' fitness ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' copy number variant ', ' copy number variation ', ' Copy Number Polymorphism ', ' Data ', ' Resource Development ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Instruction ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' biological systems ', ' genomic variation ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' genomic science ', ' genome sciences ', ' machine learning method ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' genomic locus ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,132244,0.0029586551099897414
"Automated, high-throughput identification of genetic structural variants for gene editing and undiagnosed genetic diseases screening ABSTRACT A simple method to comprehensively discover, characterize and identify structural variants arising from normal metabolic processes, as well as cell manipulations, would have great utility for gene editing, oncology, and rare disease research, among other applications. De Novo Directional Genomic Hybridization (dGH™) has been developed to efficiently screen thousands of cells for the presence of simple, complex, and heterogenous structural variants. In this project, Automated, High-Throughput Identification of Genetic Structural Variants for Gene Editing and Undiagnosed Genetic Diseases Screening, we propose K-Band™ dGH, an expanded dGH method. K-Band dGH is an in-situ hybridization method that utilizes high-density chromatid paints with bands of distinct spectra. A normal chromosome has a definitive pattern of bands, spectra and probe density. Structural variants are detected and identified via changes to the signal pattern. The proposed K-Band™ dGH method will provide the means for de novo discovery of balanced allelic translocations involving breakpoints at the same loci, inversions, and sister chromatid recombination and exchange events that are invisible to existing methods such as sequencing and aCGH. K-Band dGH will additionally characterize deletions, duplications, translocations, aneuploidy, polyploidy and more complex rearrangements. Structural variations cause a wide range of disorders, from rare diseases to cancers, and can be precise and definitive biomarkers. Also, because variations arise from the mis-repair of DNA double-strand breaks, unintended structural damage is an inevitable and potentially high-risk byproduct of genome editing. The potential of genome editing approaches such as CRISPR-Cas9 in the treatment of diseases is widely recognized and the realization of the promise of such therapeutic approaches will rely on accurate confirmation of the presence and absence of potentially risky structural variants. For these reasons, comprehensive detection and characterization of structural variations is a necessary step toward understanding, diagnosing and ultimately precisely treating genetic diseases. From a homogeneous or heterogenous population of cells, and in a single experiment, K-Band dGH will identify cells with a structurally normal phenotype, detect all classes of structural variants, and locate the breakpoints of all simple and complex structural variants in each cell. With a limit of detection below 5Kb, K-Band dGH is an ideal method for determining the outcomes of gene editing, discovering the causes of undiagnosed rare diseases, profiling genomic structural instability and variability, and discovering and validating previously unknown structural genetic drivers of disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Modern genomics, driven by the demands of personalized medicine, needs higher throughput, higher integrity, and improved resolution to enable the discovery of new disease drivers and in the development of safer gene therapies. Rapid, accurate, efficient characterization of structural variants and their associated risks is critical to the discovery of potential therapeutic avenues for undiagnosed and rare diseases, and to the development of engineered cellular therapies, including stem cells, CAR-T and other gene therapies leveraging gene-editing tools such as CRISPR. K-Band™ dGH, proposed in Automated, High-Throughput Identification of Genetic Structural Variants for Gene Editing and Undiagnosed Genetic Diseases Screening, will enable single-cell, single-experiment identification of clinically important structural variants that cannot be discovered or identified by NGS or other available methods with broad applicability in genome engineering

"Center for Multi- and Trans-ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) will identify genomic variants relevant to health and disease by genome sequencing over 225,000 participants across a multitude of diseases. The GSP will also serve as a pilot for the Precision Medicine Initiative that aims to enroll and sequence more than a million people representative of U.S. ethnic diversity. Here, we propose a GSP analysis center focused on Multi- and Trans- ethnic Mapping of Mendelian and Complex Diseases. There is a growing recognition of the substantial scientific advantages, as well as public health importance, of conducting biomedical research across ethnically diverse cohorts. We propose to develop scalable methods that incorporate ancestry to optimize medical genomic study design and improve power for uncovering the role of common and rare variants in disease. Achieving this goal requires expertise across diverse domains of knowledge including: medical and population genomics, algorithm development for complex disease mapping, and expertise in management of large-scale databases. Here, we have assembled a world-class team of medical and population geneticists, computer scientists, statisticians and clinicians, with leading expertise in the development of novel and scalable strategies for characterizing sequence variants and their role in disease. Importantly, our group has been at the forefront of development of resources, study designs and methods to enable genomic research in U.S. minority populations. Our project has three main objectives. First, we will develop an Automated Scalable Ancestry Pipeline (ASAP) for common disease mapping in diverse populations. ASAP will improve the computational efficiency of existing state-of-the-art methods for ancestry inference and develop important extensions to linear mixed models (LMMs) and other mapping strategies leveraging local and global ancestry. We will also develop methods to refine phenotypes and identify common controls for disease studies and define endpoints. Secondly, we will develop tools and resources for trans- and multi-population rare variant discovery that incorporate patterns of local and sub-continental ancestry. We will also develop machine-learning tools for variant annotation that leverage ancestral information, patterns of sequence evolution, and protein structure in a unified framework. Furthermore, we will incorporate population-specific patterns of cellular phenotypes to improve functional prediction algorithms for non-coding and coding variants. Lastly, we will disseminate our results through web-based resource that empower the biomedical research community. We will augment existing resources including ClinGen by annotating and characterizing pathogenic variants across diverse populations. We will develop a secure web-server that allows sharing of summary statistics and analysis pipelines to enable discovery, fine-mapping and functional prediction of genetic variants. Our team has ample experience with NIH-funded consortia and is dedicated to meeting the overall GSP project goals through collaborative work with NHGRI leadership and other funded investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of our project is to accelerate the discovery of DNA variation relevant to health and disease by analyzing data from over 225,000 ethnically and racially diverse patients that will undergo genome sequencing. Of particular importance is ensuring we have powerful statistical methods for analyzing data from underserved groups including U.S. minority populations.

"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes Project Summary/Abstract  The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. One of the main bottlenecks in analysis of genomic data is efficient and scalable visualization approaches. The PEGR open source platform will provide programmatic access to any number of human cell sequenced datasets, from any stage of NGS processing, with the pipeline analysis results available for high-throughput machine learning testing and development. This project will empower discovery through the automated analysis and visualization of results from both small- and large-scale datasets. This architecture will include the following features: 1) a secure, cloud-based, metadata management system that instills best practices of experimental rigor, reproducibility, and data sharing; 2) automated Galaxy-based epigenomic data processing pipelines that provide easy-to-use “wizards” for standardized processing of common epigenomic data types; and 3) an easily de-ployable, open source software package as a means to disseminate data, tools, and discoveries via cloud services. Project Narrative Proteins that bind to the human genome control the genes that govern human health. Precise identification of their positional organization informs us of how cells normally behave, and how they will respond to stress, disease, and therapies.

"Integrated multi-omics analyses of early mammalian craniofacial development Abstract Craniofacial abnormalities are some of the most commonly occurring human birth defects worldwide, with up to 200,000 children born every year with some type of craniofacial defect. These defects can occur as part of complex syndromes that involve multiple tissues and organs. The syndromic forms of these disorders have been successfully linked to nearly 500 genes including TWIST1 for craniosynostosis and IRF6 for orofacial clefting. However more frequently no other part of the body is directly involved (50% of craniosynostoses, 70% of orofacial clefts). Genome wide association studies indicate heritability for such defects, however the vast majority of associations fall outside of genes suggesting defective gene regulation is a major contributor to incidence of such defects. Gene regulatory elements can be located throughout the genome and typically have tissue-specific activity, making them difficult to identify and predict what gene they control. The overall objective of this application is to integrate epigenomic and transcriptomic data sets from early human and mouse craniofacial development from our lab as well as FaceBase to comprehensively predict regulatory element-gene interactions. Our hypothesis posits that conserved regulatory networks between human and mouse are enriched for disease relevant biology. In Aim 1 we propose to systematically identify chromatin states in human from 4.5 to 8 weeks of gestation and in mouse from embryonic days 9.5 to 15.5. In Aim 2 we propose to identify genes that are coordinately regulated in both species across these developmental windows. Finally, in Aim 3 we propose to integrate these two disparate network types to identify regulatory element-gene pairings. We will experimentally validate predicted interactions in a culture model of cranial neural crest cells using proximity-ligation coupled with immunoprecipitation. Our proposed studies will generate the most comprehensive epigenomic and transcriptomic networks in a developing human tissue and for the first time identify the conserved regulatory architecture for building the mammalian orofacial complex. Defects in embryonic patterning resulting in clefts of orofacial tissue are common birth defects affecting more than 1 in 1000 live births. The genetic causes of these defects have been difficult to determine, but all current evidence suggests defective gene regulation during embryonic development underlies these birth defects.

"Computational Methods to Characterize Alternative Splicing from Massive Collections of RNA-seq Data SUMMARY Alternative splicing (AS) is a gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human biology and disease. High throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) is making it possible to survey the expressed genes and their alternative splicing variations in a wide variety of cellular conditions. However, the short reads are challenging to analyze, demanding highly sophisticated computational methods that can extract meaningful AS information efficiently, accurately, and in a comprehensive way. While there has been great progress so far, current methods based on assembling the short reads into transcript annotations have reached a plateau. We propose two innovations that can help overcome the limits. The first is one-step simultaneous analyses of multiple samples in an RNA-seq collection, in contrast with the current two-step approach that analyzes each sample separately and then merges the results. The second is to create and interrogate assembly-free representations of AS. The project will design a suite of tools that will leverage the latent information in large collections of samples and from heterogeneous data types to build complete and accurate AS signatures of tissues and cell types, and to elucidate the regulatory circuitry of AS and its functional implications. Aim 1 will develop a high- performance multi-sample transcript assembly tool, combining subexon graph representations of genes and AS variations, statistical methods for improved feature detection, and search space reduction techniques for efficient sample processing. Aim 2 will build highly efficient and accurate feature selection tools to detect and characterize assembly-free AS variations (subexons and introns), simultaneously from collections of RNA-seq samples. It will combine novel regularized programs with complex models of intronic `noise' and other RNA-seq confounders, and enable analyses of differential splicing and to identify individual and group-specific variations. Lastly, Aim 3 will develop a system to comprehensively model the regulatory and functional circuitry of AS and the effects of mutations, starting from deep learning models of sequences and alignments and integrating expression, sequence, epigenetic and mutation data across tissues, cell types and conditions. We will rigorously test and evaluate all tools in simulations and on large public data sets, as well as on thyroid and head and neck cancer data provided by our collaborators, and we will experimentally validate random subsets of predictions with capillary electrophoresis and qRT-PCR. Collectively, the concepts, methods and tools will establish a new framework for analyzing RNA-seq data that can efficiently tackle the `big data' challenges, leading to more complete discovery and annotation of AS structure and function in human health and disease.   NARRATIVE Alternative splicing is a fundamental gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human physiology and disease. Next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is making it possible to characterize alternative splicing in great detail, however, current bioinformatics analysis tools miss important variations.

"Resolving single-cell brain regulatory elements with bulk data supervised models Gene regulation is an important determinant of the complex specialization of cells in the human brain, and nucleotide changes within regulatory elements contribute to risk for psychiatric disorders. We therefore hypothesize that these debilitating diseases are driven in part by genetic variants that alter gene expression and disturb the balance and function of cell types in brain tissue. Single-cell open chromatin assays are a promising approach to testing this hypothesis by mapping variants to regulatory elements specific to and shared across cell populations. There are two major barriers to this strategy, for which our project proposes modeling solutions. First, despite being the best assay currently, single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) suffers from low resolution, meaning that an open chromatin region may be supported by zero or few reads in a given cell. This makes it hard to identify coherent cell populations. We propose a network model for semi-supervised clustering of cells in scATAC-seq that leverages information from higher-coverage bulk tissue experiments and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), if available. The expected outcomes from applying this model to compendia of brain data from public repositories and our collaborators are (i) identification of open chromatin regions that differentiate cell types and states, and (ii) discovery of resolved cell populations whose open chromatin is enriched for psychiatric disorder associated genetic variants. These results alone may not be enough to develop a mechanistic understanding of how variants impact brain function. To address this second challenge, we will implement a computationally efficient, machine-learning framework for predicting the specific regulatory functions of single-cell open chromatin regions from our network model and other approaches. Gene regulatory enhancers are particularly amenable to this approach, because high-throughput mouse transgenics and massively parallel reporter assays have generated enough validated enhancers for supervised learning. Our framework will be easy to apply to other regulatory functions, such as insulating boundaries in chromatin capture data. By developing a compressed, yet flexible, featurization of massive bulk and single-cell data compendia, we will enable rapid iteration with computationally intensive prediction algorithms to be applied to single-cell open chromatin regions. Our approach will also incorporate transfer learning from data-rich (e.g., postmortem or mouse brains) to data-poor settings (e.g., human late-gestation brains). We expect predicted regulatory elements to be more enriched for psychiatric disorder genetic risk, to provide mechanistic insight regarding how variants cause disease, and to be useful molecular tools. Together our two proposed computational approaches will leverage the complementary strengths of bulk and single-cell data to resolve regulatory elements that drive the exquisite diversity of cells in developing and adult brains towards mapping the non-coding contribution of psychiatric disease. The human brain is a complex tissue comprised of diverse cell types with distinct gene regulation and function, making it difficult to mechanistically link genetic mutations to differences in brain health. This project will develop a network model and machine-learning framework that leverage single-cell and bulk genomics data to identify genome sequences that control gene expression in specific cell populations and states. We hypothesize that these cell type resolved regulatory elements will shed light on how sequence variants outside protein-coding genes increase risk for psychiatric disorders.",Resolving single-cell

"Gene expression and regulation in C. elegans with single cell resolution Abstract The nematode C. elegans is unique among model organisms in having a defined lineage and known connections for all its 302 neurons. The genome sequence was completed more than 20 years ago, but knowing which genes in the genome are used in exactly which cells and what transcription factors are controlling that expression remains a major challenge. We have successfully applied single cell- (sc-)RNA-seq methods to one larval stage and three embryonic stages to measure the RNA content of individual cells across the whole animal. We also have preliminary data that indicates that we can assay chromatin accessibility at the single cell level using the assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq). We now propose to collect both sc-RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data at multiple stages to determine the gene expression patterns of each cell in the worm and the active regulatory sequence throughout the entire life cycle of C. elegans. In turn we will use the combined data sets along with chromatin- immunoprecipitation- (ChIP-) seq data to impute what transcription factors are controlling expression of each gene in the genome in every cell and what regulatory sequences these transcription factors recognize. The results will provide a valuable resource to scientists studying the worm and addresses a major outstanding question in the molecular biology of development. In addition, these data sets, from an animal with a “ground truth” should serve as a platform for methods development in the single cell field. Narrative The nematode C. elegans is a simple animal that as an adult has just 959 somatic cells that arise from a known and constant lineage. We propose to use single cell methods to measure in every cell the expression of each gene and the active regulatory regions throughout the life cycle. Using these data and others, we will impute how these regulatory regions and the transcription factors that bind to them control gene expression in each cell.",Gene expression and regulation in C. elegans with single cell resolution,9969245,R01HG010478,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Larva ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Nematoda ', ' Nematodes ', ' roundworm ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Transposase ', ' Measures ', ' Dissociation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' C elegans ', ' C. elegans ', ' C.elegans ', ' Caenorhabditis elegans ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Cell Lineage ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Catalogs ', ' exhaustion ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Somatic Cell ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' muscle system ', ' muscular system ', ' ChIP assay ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' cell assay ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' Population ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' scRNA-seq ', ' single cell RNA-seq ', ' single cell RNAseq ', ' single-cell RNA sequencing ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,510309,0.029221819212555955
"Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Over the past 10 years human genetics studies made unprecedented numbers of discoveries relating genome variation to common diseases. While it is unquestionably true that we have learned substantially from the discoveries made to date, we must also acknowledge that with respect to the identification and characterization of the genome variation affecting risk of common human diseases - those accounting for the overwhelming majority of public health care expenditures - our discoveries have not generated nearly the knowledge of disease etiology that we would have expected given the sheer number of these discoveries. The combination of these observations coupled with the dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing is driving the case for moving to whole genome sequencing studies for common disease. We have focused our application on three critical challenges for methods development and analysis of whole genome sequence data. While there has been substantial progress in methods development for analysis of exome sequencing, with gene-based tests that are relatively robust to the direction of effects of rare coding variants as well as the proportionof the gene's rare variants contributing to phenotype, it is clear that methods integrating the analysis of common and rare variation as well as functional genomics data will be essential for appropriate analysis of whole genome sequence data. Thus, we propose in Specific Aim 1 to develop novel methods, software and analysis pipelines for integrated analysis of common and rare variants for the analysis of whole genome sequence on 50,000- 100,000 individuals for any given common disease, and in Specific Aim 2 to develop and apply novel approaches for prioritizing results from these large-scale sequencing studies using BioVU, the 200,000 member biobank at Vanderbilt that is associated with 30 years of high quality electronic health records, and in Specific Aim 3 to develop queriable results databases and a comprehensive web portal to serve results of our studies on the sequence data for both the internal sequencing community and for the broader scientific community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies are being carried out to understand the genetic architecture of human complex diseases. It remains challenging to decipher the genetic mechanisms of disease etiology. In this application we aim to develop a suite of statistical and computational methods to identify genes and variants associated with complex disease and use BioVU, a DNA BioBank linked to electronic health records, to validate and investigate genetic architecture of multiple complex diseases.","Analysis, Validation and Resource Creation for Genome Sequencing of Complex Diseases",10116927,U01HG009086,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Communities ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Government ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Generations ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' pleiotropic effect ', ' pleiotropy ', ' pleiotropism ', ' success ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' functional genomics ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Data ', ' Large-Scale Sequencing ', ' Validation ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' NHGRI ', ' National Center for Human Genome Research ', ' National Human Genome Research Institute ', ' disease phenotype ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' cost ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Coupled ', ' human disease ', ' public health relevance ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' exome-seq ', ' exome sequencing ', ' rare allele ', ' rare variant ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' Genetic study ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' web portal ', ' human genomics ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' genomic science ', ' genome sciences ', ' genetic architecture ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' gene testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' genetic testing ', ' ']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,864183,0.08926021278842002
"Computational modeling of spatial genome organization and gene regulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome plays an essential role in genome stability, gene regulation, and many diseases, including cancer. The recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) and its variants provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate higher-order chromatin organization. Despite the rapidly accumulating resources for investigating 3D genome organization, our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and functions of the genome organization remain largely incomplete. Hi-C analyses and 3D genome research are still in their early stage and face several challenges. First, high-resolution chromatin contact maps require extremely deep sequencing and hence have been achieved only for a few cell lines. Second, it is computationally challenging to complement 3D genome structure with one-dimensional (1D) genomic and epigenomic features. Third, recent studies have just begun to infer associations between chromatin interactions and genetic variants and to identify potential target genes of those variants at the genome-wide scale. Given these challenges and my unique multi-disciplinary training, my long-term research goal is to develop innovative computational and statistical methods to uncover the interplay between 3D genome structure and function. Speciﬁcally, in the next ﬁve years, I will i) develop computational approaches to enhance the resolution of existing Hi-C data and investigate ﬁne-scale 3D genome architecture as well as its spatiotemporal dynamics and ii) build scalable and interpretable machine learning models that leverage 1D epigenomic data to predict cell type-speciﬁc 3D chromatin interactions and gene expression and elucidate the function of 3D genome organization in gene regulation and human diseases. The completion of the proposed work will deepen our knowledge of 3D genome architecture as well as its functions in gene regulation and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The overarching mission of my research is to understand the interplay between genome architecture and gene regulation. Recent development of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture techniques has allowed us to look beyond the nucleotide sequence of DNA and investigate the principles of higher-order chromatin organization.

"Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular Disease-associated genetic variants have been found to be enriched in regulatory genomic regions of gene expression. In order to gain detailed understanding of disease mechanisms, one central question is to systematically delineate how tissue-specific gene expression programs are regulated. Enhancers are a major family of regulatory elements with complex signatures and they are abundant in the human genome. Enhancer regulation of gene expression is highly tissue-specific, associated with combinatorial transcription factor binding, and involved with long-range three-dimensional chromatin interactions. It is therefore challenging to characterize the large-scale enhancer regulatory networks. The primary goal of this project is to develop a suite of probabilistic models and efficient machine learning algorithms to predict genome-wide enhancer regulatory networks in diverse panels of cellular contexts and the associated molecular mechanisms to establish long-range interactions, which will be leveraged to interpret disease-associated genetic variants. In Aim 1, novel integrative graphical models will be developed to predict long-range chromatin interactions linking tissue-specific enhancers to their distal target genes, along with combinatorial transcription factor binding patterns. In Aim 2, computational algorithms will be designed to interrogate how specific chromatin interactions are established, leading to mechanistic insights on chromatin formation. In Aim 3, statistical models will be developed to integrate enhancer-gene regulatory networks with genetics data to predict which non-coding variants may disrupt regulatory links and cause diseases, with improved statistical power and accuracy. This modeling framework will substantially expand the analytical ability on non-coding variants and human disease mechanisms. Computational predictions from the three aims will be experimentally tested in mouse models of breast cancer development. This project will lead to both innovative computational tools and systematic biological insights on long-range enhancer regulation and their functional roles in human diseases. The advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms will provide efficient big-data integration tools for epigenetics, gene regulation and human genetics. Comprehensive predictions from this project represent valuable platforms to delineate genetic variants and disease mechanisms. Novel mechanistic insights of diseases at the regulatory and molecular level will facilitate improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for human diseases.",Statistical modeling of long-range chromatin interactions on gene regulation and underlying molecular,9932407,R01GM131398,"['Affect ', ' Chromatin ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' transcription factor USF ', ' Upstream Stimulatory Factor ', ' Upstream Transcription Factor ', ' helix-loop-helix activator USF ', ' transcription factor MLTF ', ' Enhancers ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' functional genomics ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' tissue resource ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Breast tumor model ', ' mammary cancer model ', ' mammary tumor model ', ' Breast Cancer Model ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Differential Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Gene Expression ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' data integration ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' combinatorial ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' Network-based ', ' human disease ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' genetic information ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' genetic condition ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,325001,0.13387716840751918
"Genome-wide structural organization of proteins within human gene regulatory complexes The DNA sequence of the human genome informs us as to the composition of proteins that make up healthy cells, but also altered compositions that create diseased cells. How protein production is controlled through the regulation of the genes that encode them is of critical importance for healthy and diseased cells. Knowing precisely where gene regulatory proteins bind, and are organized throughout the genome, including their interactions with each other, informs us as to how genes are regulated and mis-regulated. Since there are potentially thousands of different kinds of regulatory proteins and thousands of different kinds of human cell types and environmental responses that are a product of various subsets of regulatory proteins, the entire “universe” of gene regulatory events is quite substantial and consequently, quite costly to identify. A subset of these events will likely be informative or diagnostic of diseases states. Therefore, an important goal is to define informative interactions using cost-enabling, high accuracy, and robust genome-wide assays. To this end, ChIP-exo was developed to map the genomic binding locations of gene regulatory proteins at near-single base pair resolution. This assay will be applied, in high throughput, to determine the genome-wide positional organization of factors within protein-DNA complexes, like enhanceosomes. By broadly mapping the various classes of proteins that constitute much of the regulated epigenome, general rules about enhancer and repressor complex organization will be deduced. Aim 1 involves collecting genome-wide ChIP-exo data in human cell lines for a wide variety of protein-DNA complexes. Aim 2 will develop and implement computational approaches towards pattern recognition and data distillation in ChIP-exo datasets. The results are expected to provide structural insights into macromolecular protein complex assembly on a genomic scale, and in various cell types and conditions. Proteins that bind throughout the human genome control the genes that govern human health. Precise identification of the positional organization of these proteins within complexes will inform us as to the mechanics of their action, and mis-action when diseased.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss

"Comprehensive Characterization of Adaptive Regulatory Variation Linked to Human Disease Project Summary/ Abstract  Over the past decade there has been a rapid expansion of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), as well as the development of large-scale consortia like the UKBioBank and the All of Us project. While the number of genetic associations to human traits and disease is soaring, tools to characterize and interpret these variants are lacking. One challenge to realizing the potential of genomics is that over 99% of human genetic variation is non-coding, regulatory sequences. However, ‘regulatory grammar’ – the complex pattern of sequences that interact with transcription factors to control gene expression, is poorly understood. A repertoire of well-characterized causal variants is needed to build generalizable models with which to unlock insights into the genetic basis of human health and history.  Natural selection is a powerful driver of human genetic variation. As our species has encountered new climates, dramatic alterations in diet, and novel pathogens, these selective pressures have left hundreds of signatures of adaptation in our genomes, reflected in our species’ diversity of disease risk and morphology. For selection to have acted positively on them, these adaptive alleles must exhibit relatively strong phenotypic effects, and they continue to contribute to modern traits and disease (e.g. height or sickle cell anemia). Salient examples of human adaptation include immunity, metabolism, and morphology, all of which have extensive, unresolved GWAS signals. This renders the lens of recent evolution a powerful, but underutilized, tool for identifying alleles that contribute to phenotypic variation in modern association studies.  This proposal aims to expand the repertoire of well-characterized GWAS signals, by A) using evolution to prioritize adaptive variants, and B) applying novel, high-throughput experimental and computational tools to comprehensively decipher the functions of regulatory variants. These approaches will identify much needed causal variants, devise paradigms for their study, and inform future predictive models to characterize them. During the mentored phase of the K99, I will first develop methods to colocalize signals of selection and GWAS, and then use Variant Effect Predictions (VEP) to predict their function. I will then employ high-through methods such as a the massively parallel reporter assay and CRISPR non-coding screen to functionally characterize them directly. From the adaptive GWAS alleles our screens identify, we will make in-vivo system to more deeply characterize them during the Independent R00 phase. During this time I will deploy a variety of genomic tools such as ChIP, ChIA-PET, and RNA-seq to understand the adaptive variants’ molecular etiology. I will use the empirical data fro these studies, and the MPRA/HCR-FlowFISH screens to build more accurate VEP models. ! Project Narrative While thousands of genomic regions have been linked to human evolution and diseases, many of the genetic variants responsible are non-coding and thus difficult to interpret. I propose to identify adaptive human alleles underlying genome wide association studies and comprehensively characterize them using novel computational and experimental tools. I will then make in-vivo models of these to test their function and effects on fitness, improving future predictions of how genetic variants impact human evolution and health.",Comprehensive

"Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most disease-associated variants lie in non-coding regions of the genome and exert their influence through effects on gene expression. However, we lack a predictive framework to interpret such non-coding variants, limiting how genomic data is used in precision medicine. We may be able to interpret non-coding variants with new machine learning algorithms, but so far the practical applications of machine learning in functional genomics have been limited because of two major challenges. First, the size and diversity of training data sets in functional genomics are orders of magnitude smaller than in applications where machine learning has been successful, such as image recognition and product recommendation. A second challenge is that if training data are not collected in an appropriate in vitro cellular model, then the resulting machine learning models may not generalize to relevant in vivo cell types. To improve the application of machine learning to non-coding variants, I propose to address both the limited size of training data sets and the efficacy of cell culture models. A core principle of machine learning is that model performance improves with more data. In Aim 1, I propose to increase the size and diversity of training data by performing iterative cycles of machine learning and experimental validation with Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs). The key aspect of my approach is to algorithmically design each successive MPRA library to contain sequences that are most likely to improve the next round of modeling. I recently trained my first model on data that I collected from MPRA experiments of cis-regulatory sequences that function in mammalian photoreceptors. To avoid any issues with cell lines, I performed these experiments in ex vivo developing retinas, which retain the appropriate tissue architecture. However, unlike photoreceptors, most cell types are not experimentally tractable in their native physiological context. Thus, it will be important to determine how well in vitro cell lines recapitulate in vivo cis-regulation. In Aim 2, I propose to determine whether a tractable cell culture model can recapitulate results from ex vivo retinas. I will use existing MPRA data from ex vivo retinas as a standard to compare against data collected in cell lines engineered to express combinations of photoreceptor transcription factors. I aim to address whether engineering tractable cell lines to express tissue-specific transcription factors might be a general approach for collecting data to train machine learning models that generalize to in vivo systems. Successful completion of these aims will produce a general approach to increase the size and diversity of functional genomic training data, and may result in a general method for producing experimentally tractable systems for machine learning applications, ultimately helping us better apply genomic data to precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many genetic variants that cause disease do not affect the structure of genes, but instead affect short DNA sequences that control when, where, or how much a gene is produced. Every individual human contains thousands of genetic variants in these control regions, but only a small number of these variants influence gene production. I propose a combined experimental and computational framework to predict which variants affect gene production and which variants are harmless.",Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning,10065897,F31HG011431,"['Affect ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Engineering ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Libraries ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Photoreceptors ', ' Photoreceptor Cell ', ' Photosensitive Cell ', ' Visual Receptor ', ' Production ', ' Recommendation ', ' Retina ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Reporter ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' cell engineering ', ' cellular engineering ', ' High Throughput Assay ', ' high throughput screening ', ' functional genomics ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' cell assay ', ' Cellular Assay ', ' Validation ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' synthetic biology ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' application in practice ', ' practical application ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,31454,0.12094653842351812
"Single cell atlas as a roadmap for interpreting human genetic variation in complex disease Project Summary Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of loci likely affecting human health. To translate these findings into therapeutic targets and disease treatments, we need to understand the cellular context and underlying biological mechanisms through which each disease associated variant disrupts function. Large scale, information rich datasets are being generated across multiple modalities including transcriptomics from single cell RNA-seq studies, traits and phenotypes from the UK Biobank and germline genetic variation from exome sequencing studies. Here, we propose to develop methods to integrate these amazing resources towards understanding the identifying biological and cellular mechanisms that are leading to disease. The objectives will be accomplished with the following specific aims: 1) Integrate population scale biological datasets including UK Biobank and single cell transcriptomics data to construct gene modules with the goal to recapitulate biological pathways. 2) Develop a statistical framework to measure mutational burden across each of the cell type specific gene modules. Together, this research proposal will increase the power in interpreting human genetic variation and help better understand the mechanism through which they act. These methods are being developed around an IBD dataset and will derive substantial molecular information about the mechanisms driving IBD. The lessons and methodological advances from this work will be directly applicable in many complex disease contexts.

"Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms for orofacial clefting (OFC) is limited by the fact that less than half of the heritable risk for this disorder has been assigned to specific genes. Towards identifying pathological sequence variants among the many irrelevant ones detected in exomes and whole genomes of patients with this disorder, an understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern the development of relevant tissues, including the oral periderm, is essential. We propose a systems biology approach to analyzing the periderm GRN. Using this approach in the past enabled us to identify three novel OFC risk genes. We will utilize two model organisms, zebrafish and mouse, because the periderm differentiation GRN appears to be highly conserved. In zebrafish, the periderm differentiates very early in embryogenesis, greatly facilitating the execution and interpretation of genetic perturbation analyses. Mouse, on the other hand, has the advantage that its craniofacial anatomy is more similar to that of humans. In Aim 1, we will determine the zebrafish periderm differentiation GRN using a state-of-the-art network inference algorithm, NetProphet 2. This tool carries out both a coexpression analysis and a differential expression analysis. Input data sets will include RNA-seq expression profiles we will generate from loss-of-function (LOF) embryos for 4 key transcription factors (TF) known to participate in this GRN. We will also identify the direct gene linkages of these key TFs in the periderm GRN. Finally, we will test a novel candidate member of the periderm GRN, Tead, by carrying out LOF tests in zebrafish, thereby exploiting the strength of this model system. In Aim 2 we will deduce the murine oral periderm differentiation GRN, also using the NetProphet algorithm. Input datasets will include expression profiles of periderm isolated from the palate shelves of wild-type mouse embryos, and from heterozygous mutants of three key TFs: Irf6, Grhl3 and Tfap2a. For each of the mutant genotypes there is evidence of abnormal periderm differentiation. We will also identify murine periderm enhancer candidates by sorting GFP-positive and -negative cells from Krt17-gfp transgenic embryos, performing ATAC-seq on both populations, and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq on cells from palate shelves and the nasal cavity. As in Aim 1, we will also identify the direct gene linkages of the key TFs. We will train a machine learning algorithm on palate periderm enhancers, and use the resulting scoring function to prioritize OFC-associated SNPs near genes that are expressed in periderm for those that are likely to directly affect risk for OFC. Finally, we will perform allele- specific reporter assays on the top candidate SNPs from each of three loci. The expected outcome is a deeper understanding of the specific TFs and cis-regulatory elements that control differentiation of the periderm. This will have a broad impact because it will enable human geneticists to prioritize candidate risk variants that emerge from whole-exome and -genome sequencing analyses of OFC. Orofacial is a common disease with a major impact on the affected individual, their family and society. Here, we will determine the gene regulatory network for periderm, an embryonic tissue that is critical for development of the palate. Our new knowledge will identify candidate genes and help identify pathogenic variants located in regulatory elements which will improve risk assessment and provide new targets for rational therapies.",Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm,9900769,R01DE023575,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Elements ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryonic Development ', ' Embryo Development ', ' Embryogenesis ', ' Epidermis ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Differentiated Gene ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nasal cavity ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Vertebrates ', ' Vertebrate Animals ', ' vertebrata ', ' Zebrafish ', ' Brachydanio rerio ', ' Danio rerio ', ' Zebra Danio ', ' Zebra Fish ', ' Enhancers ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Public Domains ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Oral ', ' Outcome Study ', ' craniofacies ', ' craniofacial ', ' mutant ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' transgenic ', ' Transgenic Organisms ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' CDH1 ', ' CDHE ', ' LCAM ', ' CDH1 gene ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Palate ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' embryonic loss ', ' Embryo Loss ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Embryonic Tissue ', ' embryo tissue ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Mammalian Genetics ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' in vivo ', ' Periderm ', ' Tissue Differentiation ', ' wildtype mouse ', ' Wild Type Mouse ', ' Pathologic ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' oral epithelia ', ' oral epithelium ', ' oral cavity epithelium ', ' paralog ', ' paralogous gene ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' orofacial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' loss of function mutation ', ' Heritability ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' loss of function ', ' network models ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' risk variant ', ' Structural Birth Defect ', ' congenital structural malformation ', ' Structural Congenital Anomalies ', ' orofacial clefting ', ' orofacial cleft ', ' ATACseq ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differential expression ', ' model building ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' support vector machine ', ' ']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,560204,0.08893103234713795

"Modeling gene expression in yeast using large degenerate libraries PROJECT SUMMARY Short sequence elements in DNA and RNA determine the levels and composition of mRNAs and proteins, making it critical that we can accurately model how any given sequence will affect transcription, splicing or translation. Such models of cis-regulation will fill in gaps in our knowledge of these core gene expression processes. Additionally, as large numbers of human genomes are sequenced, the ability to predict the effects of sequence variation on the ultimate levels of proteins will be integral to the interpretation of variation in regulatory sequences. Similarly, the construction of metabolic pathways with defined levels of expression and the engineering of synthetic gene networks require accurate knowledge of how regulatory sequences affect expression. This application seeks to use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a test case for learning how any short regulatory sequence affects protein levels. A predictive model will be trained on a set of libraries two orders of magnitude more complex than have been characterized to date. Libraries will be generated of a growth reporter gene with a million random sequences of 50 nucleotides that comprise either a DNA element that regulates transcription or an RNA element that regulates splicing or translation. The libraries will be transformed into yeast, and the yeast will be placed under selection such that they grow according to the ability of each random sequence to contribute to protein expression. A convolution neural network approach will be used to learn the relationship between these “fitness” phenotypes and their associated genotypes. Although yeast is a single-celled eukaryote, it has been the source of most of the original findings on gene expression, and these findings form the basis for much of our knowledge of more complex eukaryotes. Furthermore, the short sequences in yeast that comprise the DNA- and RNA-binding sites of regulatory proteins tend to be comparable in size to those of other organisms. Yeast is used often in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, and the work proposed here will result in novel tools for quantitatively controlling its gene expression. Initial results with a library of 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) indicate that we can construct a model to account for a large fraction of the observed variability in expression, and that the model extends to native sequence elements. The model allowed us to forward engineer 5' UTRs to have increased activity. Specific aims of this application are to assess the effects of random sequences targeted to upstream regulatory elements, core promoter elements, 5' UTRs, introns and 3' UTRs; to learn predictive and interpretable models using convolutional neural networks and to identify novel functional cis-regulatory elements; and to validate our models on native sequences and combinatorial libraries, and by engineering synthetic sequence elements with user-specified properties. In sum, the proposal seeks to construct a comprehensive and predictive model of regulatory sequence–function relationships for a well-studied single- celled eukaryote, providing a basis for similar studies on other organisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research seeks to generate a model for how regulatory sequences present in the genome of a simple organism affect the expression of a protein. These studies will be important for ultimately understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease.

"Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants ABSTRACT Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing of complex diseases have revealed a plethora of disease risk variants, most of which lie in noncoding regions of DNA without easily interpretable function. A main functional mechanism of noncoding variants is to alter chromatin accessibility to transcription factors (TFs), thereby influencing gene expression. Predicting the effects of noncoding variants on TF binding and gene expression on a large scale is thus important but remains challenging. Available computational tools for predicting regulatory variants largely rely on TF-binding motif models and/or local chromatin modification features. Here, we aim to develop a novel computational framework to address two major limitations of these methods. First, given that known disease causal noncoding variants often reside outside of TF binding motifs, how can we improve the prediction of TF binding variants outside of motifs? For this, we plan to integrate TF ChIP-seq data with features that are important for TF binding but have not been considered in previous methods, in particular the DNA breathing dynamics (AIM1). DNA breathing reflects local transient opening of the DNA double helix due to thermal fluctuations. We have shown that genetic variants can affect nearby (up to a few hundred base pairs) DNA breathing dynamics that affect TF binding. Using TF ChIP-seq data, we will train models that predict specific TF binding variants in or outside TF motifs, incorporating DNA breathing dynamics with other features such as DNA shapes and cooperative TF binding. Secondly, given that chromatin features only show modest (<2-fold) enrichment of genetic variants associated with complex diseases or traits, how can we improve the prediction of regulatory variants? For this, we will build a computation model, considering the allele-specific chromatin accessibility (ASCA; i.e., two alleles of a heterozygous individual show read imbalance in chromatin accessibility assays) as a functional readout of a regulatory variant (AIM2). We have shown that neuronal ASCA SNPs are highly enriched for those implicated by schizophrenia (SZ) GWAS. Using neuronal ASCA data, we will train models that predict variants with regulatory effects, taking advantage of our TF-specific classifiers (from AIM1). As a proof of concept, the models will be applied to a large SZ GWAS dataset to predict putative causal regulatory variants. We will validate the effects of the predicted top-ranking regulatory SZ variants on gene expression in a well-powered hiPSC sample by combining multiplex CRISPR-based SNP editing and single-cell RNA-seq analysis (AIM3). For SNPs showing the strongest regulatory effects, we will further use CRISPR editing to verify the SNP effect on gene expression and disease-relevant neuronal phenotypes. Accurately predicting TF-affecting noncoding variants will enable better understanding of the large number of noncoding variants implicated in complex disorders and help formulate testable biological hypotheses, ultimately facilitating the development of targeted therapeutics. NARRATIVE We will develop novel computational methods and a cost-effective functional validation approach to systematically infer the effect of disease-associated noncoding variants on transcription factor binding and gene expression.

"Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences The proportion of the human genome that underlies gene regulation dwarfs the proportion that encodes proteins. However, we remain poorly equipped for identifying which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to risk for both rare and common human diseases. Understanding how non-coding sequences regulate gene expression, as well as being able to predict the functional consequences of genetic variation for gene regulation, are paramount challenges for the field. Here, we propose to combine synthetic biology, massively parallel functional assays, and machine learning to profoundly advance our understanding of the `regulatory code' of the human genome. While challenging, the task of unravelling complex codes from large amounts of empirical data is not without precedent. For example, over the past decade, computer scientists working in natural language processing have made immense progress, driven in large part by a combination of algorithmic and computational improvements and enormously larger training datasets than were available to the previous generations of scientists working in this area. Inspired by the revolutionizing impact of “big data” for traditional problems in machine learning, we propose to model gene regulatory phenomena using training datasets with several orders of magnitude more examples than naturally exist in the human genome. We predict that the models learned from massive numbers of synthetic examples will strongly outperform models learned from the small number of natural examples. We will demonstrate our approach by developing comprehensive, quantitative, and predictive models for alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, two widespread regulatory mechanisms by which a single gene can code for multiple transcripts and proteins. However, we anticipate that this basic paradigm – specifically, the massively parallel measurement of the functional behavior of extremely large numbers of synthetic sequences followed by quantitative modeling of sequence-function relationships – can be generalized to advance our understanding of diverse forms of gene regulation. This research seeks to develop predictive models of alternative splicing and polyadenylation by learning from millions of synthetic constructs, orders of magnitude more than the number of endogenous examples. These models will be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and how this variation can lead to disease.",Predictive Modeling of Alternative Splicing and Polyadenylation from Millions of Random Sequences,9869019,R01HG009136,"['Algorithms ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biological Phenomena ', ' Biologic Phenomena ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Computers ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dwarfism ', ' Nanism ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' RNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' Reporter ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Isoforms ', ' Protein Isoforms ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' synthetic DNA ', ' synthetic construct ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' RNA Polyadenylation ', ' Polyadenylation ', ' Data ', ' Transcript ', ' Validation ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' synthetic biology ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' human disease ', ' disease-causing mutation ', ' exon skipping ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' Mendelian disease ', ' Mendelian genetic disorder ', ' monogenic disease ', ' monogenic disorder ', ' single-gene disease ', ' single-gene disorder ', ' Mendelian disorder ', ' CRISPR method ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats method ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats methodology ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technique ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' causal allele ', ' causal gene ', ' causal mutation ', ' causative mutation ', ' causative variant ', ' causal variant ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,573285,0.0807789455599627
"ADAR-editing landscape dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders Project Abstract:  Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) editing plays a major role in shaping transcriptome diversity by creating variant isoforms that enable fine-tuning of calcium-mediated excitatory and other signaling needed for brain development, neural plasticity and mood regulation. The spatio-temporal ADAR editing landscapes are tightly regulated by controlling ADAR expression levels to preserve preferential binding and editing. Previous studies have shown that activation of the interferon pathways of the innate immune system – such as those seen in viral infections - leads to increased expression of ADAR1p150, which ultimately results in changes to ADAR editing patterns. Furthermore, common side effects to innate immune activation by interferon alpha therapies include increased risk of depression and suicide. The changes in spatio-temporal regulation of editing patterns can lead to a wide spectrum of neurological symptoms, including neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., decreased ADAR editing in the serotonin receptor subunit2C in the prefrontal cortex observed in individuals who commit suicide). Yet, our understanding of ADAR editing landscapes remain cursory. Advances in high throughput RNA-seq enable more accurate variant calling from the sequencing reads, providing a way to map ADAR editing patterns in the transcriptome. However, there are no computational pipelines focused on ADAR editing that are easy to use, are reproducible and can handle large scale analysis. I have recently built a pipeline to handle meta-analysis of RNA-seq data that incorporates variant calling steps, but further work is needed to validate this tool to assure accuracy and reproducibility of results. It can then be used to map the spatio-temporal variation of ADAR editing landscapes. The proposed project will study ADAR editing landscapes in the following ways: (i) new computational pipelines will be benchmarked to use variant calling with RNA-seq datasets using simulated reads, (ii) ADAR editing landscape diversity in the publicly available human samples will be mapped; the computational predictions and hypotheses generated from the pipeline will be validated using (iii) measuring calcium flux in cells with known differential ADAR editing landscapes caused by PolyI:C (viral infection mimic) treatment. The proposed work will yield a validated pipeline capable of mapping ADAR editing landscapes with machine learning algorithms. Defining ADAR editing landscapes is paramount to biomarker discovery and can influence precision medicine applications in diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. This project will allow for me to gain the knowledge base necessary to become an independent researcher with a unique skill set of both computational and benchwork methods to advance the field of neuroscience. Project Narrative Inferring ADAR editing landscapes and their link with ion homeostasis and excitatory signaling in the brain is important for understanding, diagnosing or staging neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder and suicide. This proposed project will develop and validate computational tools to use RNA-seq from publicly available datasets for ADAR editing inferences and to delineate patterns of editing changes in cells experiencing viral infections. Overall, this project will give me the training to build my unique skill set of both computational and experimental methods that will enable me as an independent researcher to bridge the gap between bioinformatics and experimental researchers and translate my findings into precision medicine.",ADAR-editing landscape dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders,9992699,F31MH123131,"['Accounting ',
