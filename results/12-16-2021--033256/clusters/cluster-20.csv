"BREAST DIAGNOSIS:  QUANTITATIVE IMAGING BY ULTRASOUND The goal of this proposal is to develop and investigate methods and instruments for obtaining reliable quantitative ultrasound images of several acoustic paramenters within two-dimensional coronal cross sections of the breasts of women.  The instrument and associated programs will synergistically combine quantitative multimodal images to obtain diagnoses of breast disease.  Ultrasound computer-assisted transmission tomography will be utilized to obtain quantitative images of acoustic speed, acoustic attenuation, acoustic absorption and scatter and reflection where appropriate.  Both analytic and iterative methods of correcting aberrations in the images caused by inhomogeneous refractive index will be investigated.  Compound B-scan images will also be obtained in the same coronal planes.  Our clinical scanner will be modified to obtain data necessary for high fidelity images derived using newly developed inverse scattering methods.  Patients scheduled for surgical biopsy will be scanned and the resulting images compared to the histology results from biopsy and/or surgical mastectomy.  Comparisons between surgical specimens and acoustic images will be made using methods of automated computer-assisted pattern classification and recognition combined with histological methods of tissue preparation specifically designed to aid in comparing ultrasound images of the coronal plane of the intact breast with similar planes through the excised breast.  This parallel investigation of the clinical instrument, inverse scattering methods, histologic tissue analysis techniques, and pattern recognition programs should result in complete evaluation of the prototype clinical scanner and may result in an instruemnt design capable for use in the clinical environment.

"EXPERT RADIOLOGY ASSISTANT:  PHASE II DESCRIPTION (Adapted from applicant's abstract):  Research is proposed for the development of a computer-based expert radiology assistant to aid in the diagnosis of breast cancer using clinical findings, x-ray mammograms, and ultrasound images as input data.  Based upon encouraging feasibility results which demonstrated that the Phase I prototype system produced interpretations comparable to expert radiologists, it is proposed to extend the system to more complex diagnostic situations, to incorporate a data base for statistical analysis of mammographic data, to optimize the diagnostic rules, to refine the methods of combining evidence, to improve the user interface, and to investigate the role of objective image analysis.  Specific aims of Phase II are designed to provide experimental evidence to determine the role of expert system technology in breast cancer diagnosis, training of residents, management and reporting of examination data, and assistance in detecting and quantifying of abnormalities.  The resulting expert system will be extensively tested, both retrospectively and prospectively, using clinical data to evaluate the practically attainable diagnostic accuracy, overall clinical utility, and potential for commercialization.

"INTELLIGENT MAMMOGRAPHY WORKSTATION The long term goal of the proposed project is to develop the software, image database and knowledge-base for an intelligent computer workstation that supports interpretation of mammograms for breast cancer detection. The workstation will reinforce perceptive and cognitive elements of mammography interpretation and provide a dynamic, interactive tool for teaching these skills.  The system will be based on an existing prototype mammography expert system developed by investigators in the Department of Diagnostic Imaging at the Yale School of Medicine.  Before undertaking full commercial development, we want to test the clinical appropriateness of the image recall strategies using an expanded image data base (phase I).  We will also refine design specifications during this phase.  The final system will draw from a large image database (greater than 1000 cases) and knowl- edge-base in order to assemble highly context sensitive, patient specific output that is expected to improve the accuracy of mammographic diagnosis.  This project addresses the important public health problem of breast cancer, the most common nonpreventable cause of cancer death in women.  Its training and decision support capabilities could potentially alleviate projected manpower shortages caused by current rapid increases in mammography volume, and also improve the quality of mammography interpretation.

"MEDICAL ONCOLOGY PROGRAM PROJECT--THERAPEUTIC RESEARCH Our goal in this continuing Program Project is still to facilitate the transfer of basic science information from the laboratory to help deal with clinical problems in breast cancer, but our focus broadens from primarily prognostic and mechanistic considerations in two directions.  First, we will study the molecular correlates of the developmental stages in early breast cancer, to provide not only greater understanding of how the full malignant phenotype is acquired, but also greater clinical ability to distinguish and thus to treat those benign or early malignant lesions destined to cause serious trouble.  Second, at the other end of the clinical course, we will be dissecting the components of growth factor pathways as potential targets of new treatment strategies and testing such strategies directly in preclinical model systems.  The projects will study:  1) the problem of how best to integrate both new and existing prognostic factors into a coherent assessment of risk for individual patients, comparing expanded forms of the traditional Cox multivariate analysis with newer recursive partitioning and artificial intelligence (neural network) approaches; 2) the occurrence of mutations and variants in the functional domains of the steroid receptor genes, which could result in failures to respond to hormone manipulation even though receptor is present, or in failure to detect receptor, or even in an oncogene-like receptor variant which would stimulate the tumor cell even in the absence of hormone; 3) potential molecular markers -- activated oncogenes, proliferation markers, antigens associated with metastatic behavior, etc.--in well defined early and later lesions at several stages, in order to see which markers might identify high risk lesions and to learn more about the evolutionary pathway (or pathways) by which breast cancer progresses; 4) antigens associated with proliferation as new prognostic  as new prognostic markers; 5) TGFalpha as an autocrine mediator of estrogen action, as a factor in the development of hyperplastic lesions in transgenic mice expressing a TGFalpha gene (and/or an EGF-R gene) in the mammary glands, and as a target for inhibiting malignant progression; 6) the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system, especially the receptors, IGFRI and IGFRII and the IGF binding proteins, as targets for blocking breast cancer growth and tumorigenesis.

"CLASSIFICATION OF MAMMOGRAPHIC MICROCALCIFICATION Mass screening using mammography is, at present, the only viable and effective method to detect breast cancer.  It is difficult, however, to distinguish between benign and malignant microcalcifications associated with breast cancer.  This difficulty results in a significant increase in the number of biopsy examinations.  Most of the minimal breast cancers are currently detected by the presence of micro-calcifications.  the major problems are the relatively low-positive predictive value and the high false-positive rate necessary to maximize sensitivity for minimal breast cancer detection.  It is the long-term (Phase I and Phase II) objective of this project to be able to reduce the false-positive rate of breast cancer detection, while maintaining high specificity.  The objective of Phase I is to develop a computerized artificial neural network-based mammogram analysis system.  Basic steps proposed are feature selection for the microcalcification regions in the mammograms, designing and training the neural network, and testing and verification of classification accuracy of neural network algorithms.  Image structure features will be selected from a set of mammograms with benign and malignant microcalcifications to provide good discrimination between them. The proposed system will possess the ability to accurately segment such regions.  This system can be subsequently refined to provide high specificity.

"DIAGNOSTIC AID FOR THE EARLY DETECTION OF BREAST CANCERS Mammography's role in the detection of breast cancer is well known. Although more accurate than other existing techniques, the general inability to detect small tumors and other features motivates our study of the Mammograph Display System [MDS]. The MDS is based on the application of wavelets, artificial neural networks, and other advanced signal processing techniques. The MDS will enhance radiologists' perception of mammographic features and improve the accuracy of diagnosis. The Phase I study will lead to significantly enhanced mammogram images which complement existing modalities, and allow radiologists to interactively examine diagnostic features. The Phase I study will define a Phase II prototype MDS which will be used in a pre-commercialization clinical testing program. During the Phase I period we shall demonstrate that wavelets can significantly enhance the visualization of breast carcinomas, improve diagnostic accuracy and the probability of early detection. In addition, we shall demonstrate that this enhanced imaging capability can be achieved in an affordable hardware package. We will also provide the MDS with a prototype radiologist assistant system (RAS] which identifies possible subtle and difficult to detect pathologies and directs the radiologist to their location. An MDS development and experimental system will also be developed.

"HYPERMEDIA INTELLIGENT BREAST CANCER INFORMATION SYSTEM We propose a low-cost commercial intelligent hypermedia information system to educate patients and the general public about breast cancer. User centered system design, focusing on seeing the domain from the patient's or potential patient's point of view, is central to our approach.  The need for breast cancer education evident. About 182 thousand women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year in the United States alone. Patients-and the general public-want information. Doctors and nurses are pressed for time, and for any number of reasons may not be able to provide all of the information an individual may want or need.  One technological innovation in our proposal is the application of user- centered system design to a commercially available medical information system. A second is the use of cognitive models of patients' understanding and perceived information needs regarding breast cancer and its treatments to develop the deep structure of the interface between the medical model and the user.

"PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT FOR YOUNG WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER This proposal is a response to RFA #CA/HD-93-33, ""Rehabilitation and Psychosocial Research in Younger Women with Breast Cancer."" The objectives of this research are: 1) to test the benefits of a computer-based support system (CHESS, the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System) on the quality of life and disability of younger women with breast cancer; and, 2) to begin to understand how and for what kind of people CHESS has that effect. CHESS uses expert systems, computer-mediated communication, data bases, and an easy-to-use interface to provide information, decision analysis, and social support services to women with breast cancer.  Three hundred women with breast cancer under age 50 (including 100 minority women) will be recruited from hospitals in Madison and Chicago and will be randomized into control and experimental groups. Subjects will include women with breast cancer at Stages I to IV, including recurrent breast cancer. A CHESS computer will be placed into the homes of the experimental group members for six months, while the control group will have access to standard medical practice for patient education and support, supplemented by a consistent set of written information on breast cancer. Both groups will be surveyed at pre-test, and with 2, 4 and 8 month post-tests.  The primary aim of this research is to understand the effect of CHESS on quality of -life for women with breast cancer. Specifically, we will examine whether access to CHESS produces more rapid and greater improvements in specific quality of life dimensions: functional, emotional, social-family, physical, and disease-specific complaints. We will also investigate impact of global quality of life as an exploratory analysis. The secondary aim is to begin to explore: l) whether CHESS has an effect on detailed functional performance and level of disability; and, 2) how and for what kinds of patients (e.g., minorities, more or less educated, stage of disease, etc.) does CHESS have its effects on quality of life.

"CLASSIFIERS FOR HIGH RESOLUTION CELL SORTING Despite the capability to collect sophisticated multiparameter listmode  data, both rectilinear or bit-map cell sorting boundaries still are  usually chosen manually and in a rather arbitrary fashion. Usually the  experimenter performs visual clustering prior to drawing boundaries which  have no statistical prediction of successful classification.  Visualization of complex multiparameter data is also difficult. One way  to deal with the visualization problem is to view the first three  principal components of the data and use this information to estimate the  number and approximate centroids for ""guided"" cluster analysis. Cluster  membership probabilities will then be used to make sort decisions.    Another way to deal with the problem of placing sort boundaries on the  basis of arbitrary ""visual classifications"" is to apply statistical  methods of classifying cells, e.g. discriminant analysis with Bayes  decision boundaries. Discriminant functions will be calculated and Bayes  decision boundaries will be used to sort cells on the basis of  discriminant function scores which will be calculated in real-time by  hardware and/or software lookup tables. A cost of misclassification will  also be included in the cell sorting decision.    For all classifier systems developed, classifier performance will be  measured through ROC (""receiver operating characteristics"") analyses of  true-positives and false-positives. To accomplish this we will use a  well-defined system of data and model cell systems whereby all  classifiers can be checked for correctness against ""tagged"" parameters.  All sorted model cells can be unequivocally identified by PCR (polymerase  chain reaction) or by FISH (fluorescence in-situ hybridization).    While the main focus of the proposal is to develop real-time cell  classifiers useful for cell sorting, many of the techniques can also be  used by other researchers for off-line analysis of conventional listmode  flow cytometry data.  Hence many of these techniques should prove  important to other researchers even if they are unable to perform the  sophisticated cell sorting described in this proposal.    To demonstrate the importance of these new techniques to many problems  in biology and medicine we will attempt to apply these new techniques to  several important applications including: (1) high-resolution sorting of  single fetal cells from human maternal blood for prenatal diagnosis; (2)  molecular characterizations of oncogene, tumor suppresser, metastatic,  and multi-drug resistance genes in rare human metastatic breast cancer  cells isolated from peripheral blood and bone marrow by high-speed  enrichment or high-resolution cell sorting; and (3) bone marrow purging  of metastatic cells to allow for autologous transplantations in breast  cancer patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy.

"CLASSIFIERS FOR HIGH RESOLUTION CELL SORTING Despite the capability to collect sophisticated multiparameter listmode          data, both rectilinear or bit-map cell sorting boundaries still are              usually chosen manually and in a rather arbitrary fashion. Usually the           experimenter performs visual clustering prior to drawing boundaries which        have no statistical prediction of successful classification.                     Visualization of complex multiparameter data is also difficult. One way          to deal with the visualization problem is to view the first three                principal components of the data and use this information to estimate the        number and approximate centroids for ""guided"" cluster analysis. Cluster          membership probabilities will then be used to make sort decisions.                                                                                                Another way to deal with the problem of placing sort boundaries on the           basis of arbitrary ""visual classifications"" is to apply statistical              methods of classifying cells, e.g. discriminant analysis with Bayes              decision boundaries. Discriminant functions will be calculated and Bayes         decision boundaries will be used to sort cells on the basis of                   discriminant function scores which will be calculated in real-time by            hardware and/or software lookup tables. A cost of misclassification will         also be included in the cell sorting decision.                                                                                                                    For all classifier systems developed, classifier performance will be             measured through ROC (""receiver operating characteristics"") analyses of          true-positives and false-positives. To accomplish this we will use a             well-defined system of data and model cell systems whereby all                   classifiers can be checked for correctness against ""tagged"" parameters.          All sorted model cells can be unequivocally identified by PCR (polymerase        chain reaction) or by FISH (fluorescence in-situ hybridization).                                                                                                  While the main focus of the proposal is to develop real-time cell                classifiers useful for cell sorting, many of the techniques can also be          used by other researchers for off-line analysis of conventional listmode         flow cytometry data.  Hence many of these techniques should prove                important to other researchers even if they are unable to perform the            sophisticated cell sorting described in this proposal.                                                                                                            To demonstrate the importance of these new techniques to many problems           in biology and medicine we will attempt to apply these new techniques to         several important applications including: (1) high-resolution sorting of         single fetal cells from human maternal blood for prenatal diagnosis; (2)         molecular characterizations of oncogene, tumor suppresser, metastatic,           and multi-drug resistance genes in rare human metastatic breast cancer           cells isolated from peripheral blood and bone marrow by high-speed               enrichment or high-resolution cell sorting; and (3) bone marrow purging          of metastatic cells to allow for autologous transplantations in breast           cancer patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy.

"BREAST CANCER BIOPSY--A COMPUTER AID This proposal describes the development of an artificial neural network          (ANN) for breast cancer diagnosis.  The system is trained to aid in the          decision to biopsy those patients that have suspicious mammographic              findings.  This system will decrease the variability and increase the            specificity of the decision to biopsy.  the decision to biopsy is a two          stage process: 1) the mammagrapher views the mammagram and determines the        presence of absence of image features such as caclcifications and masses,        2) these features are merged to form a diagnosis. A recent study found           that 52% of missed breast cancers are due to errors at the decision step.        About 80% of the biopsies that are performed are benign.  AxIS will              provide a service to significantly improve this performance.  The                clinician reads a mammagram, transmits the findings to AxIS where the            trained ANN returns a prediction of benign of malignant in less than one         second.  This prediction will be transmitted to the clinician  who can           then include this information in the medical decision.                           PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:                                                 The service provided by AxIS will dramatically reduce the error rate for         the decision to biopsy.   Preliminary results indicate that use of a             computer aid could decrease by half of the number of benign cases that           are biopsied without decreasing the number of malignancies found for a           savings of $335million per year.

"PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT FOR YOUNG WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER This proposal is a response to RFA #CA/HD-93-33, ""Rehabilitation and             Psychosocial Research in Younger Women with Breast Cancer."" The objectives       of this research are: 1) to test the benefits of a computer-based support        system (CHESS, the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System) on the       quality of life and disability of younger women with breast cancer; and,         2) to begin to understand how and for what kind of people CHESS has that         effect. CHESS uses expert systems, computer-mediated communication, data         bases, and an easy-to-use interface to provide information, decision             analysis, and social support services to women with breast cancer.                                                                                                Three hundred women with breast cancer under age 50 (including 100               minority women) will be recruited from hospitals in Madison and Chicago          and will be randomized into control and experimental groups. Subjects will       include women with breast cancer at Stages I to IV, including recurrent          breast cancer. A CHESS computer will be placed into the homes of the             experimental group members for six months, while the control group will          have access to standard medical practice for patient education and               support, supplemented by a consistent set of written information on breast       cancer. Both groups will be surveyed at pre-test, and with 2, 4 and 8            month post-tests.

"WAVELET IMAGE ENHANCEMENT FOR DIGITAL MAMMOGRAMS There are several evidences to show that the early detection of breast           cancer can reduce mortality from the disease. Also, X-ray film screen            mammography has shown more sensitivity and specificity to detect                 tumors than any other non-invasive diagnostic techniques that are                currently used. Hence, in this study digital mammograms are                      considered. The digital mammography also facilitates the use of                  computer aided detection and diagnosis that are the focus of this                study.                                                                                                                                                            In 90% of in situ carcinomas, calcifications are the dominant                    abnormality. Therefore, as far as the early stage cancers are                    concerned, the proportion of lesions detected on the basis of                    microcalcifications are becomingly increasingly greater. Further,                about 80% of the breast cancers are found to contain                             microcalcifications on histology examination. Therefore, the accurate            detection of microcalcifications should facilitate in early detection            of breast cancer and saving human lives. It is possible to detect                these microcalcifications by using detection algorithms since they               exhibit difference in density, size and shape from normal anatomic               structures. Hence, the focus of this study is to develop and evaluate            detection/segmentation algorithms based on 2D wavelets and                       probabilistic networks. The microcalcifications classified as                    suspicious in the segmented image (mammogram) will be highlighted for            close examination by a radiologist. The technology that results from             this study can be considered as a tool that helps a radiologist in               detecting and diagnosing breast cancer in an efficient way. The main             advantages of the proposed approach are: (1) noise reduction, (2)                image enhancement and (3) good segmentation. Since in general,                   mammograms are poor quality images with low contrast due to the small            differences in X-ray attenuation between breast tissues and noisy, the           detection techniques that reduce noise and enhance images would                  improve the detection performance.                                                                                                                                PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:                                                The proposed Phase I study will result in a novel methodology that (a)           enhances the image quality of mammogram, (b) accurately segments and             detects microcalcifications, (c) classifies microcalcifications into             suspicious or not, and (d) highlights the suspicious                             microcalcifications for close examination by a radiologist. Such a               methodology will lead to a commercial application of computer aided              detection and diagnostic tool in digital mammography. Such a                     technology should help radiologists in early detection of breast                 cancer and thus save human lives.

"FRACTAL FEATURES FOR DIAGNOSING MAMMOGRAPHIC MASSES We propose developing statistical fractal features which quantify lesion         border roughness on mammograms and using these features to distinguish           malignant and benign breast lesions.  Objective measures of lesion               roughness are important in the diagnosis and staging of breast cancer.           In this novel approach, we generate a space of fractal models, and               evaluate the fractal dimension (fd) of the lesion from the statistics            of the model space.                                                                                                                                               Using intensity as the third dimension, we generate a 3-dimensional              image of the mammogram and select a set of intensity levels found in the         lesion.  For each selected intensity level, we construct a binary                thresholded image and trace the lesion border.  Analysis is restricted           to segments of thresholded borders which are in high-gradient portions           of the 3-dimensional image and can be determined with high precision.                                                                                             Each selected boundary segments is analyzed to identify self-affine              subsegments which are modeled using multiple fractal interpolation               functions having known fd values.  Thus we construct a large sample              space of fd values which are computed from high-precision boundary               traces occurring on a range of threshold levels.  The statistics of the          fd sample space are the features used to distinguish between malignant           and benign lesions.

"CLASSIFIERS FOR HIGH RESOLUTION CELL SORTING Despite the capability to collect sophisticated multiparameter listmode          data, both rectilinear or bit-map cell sorting boundaries still are              usually chosen manually and in a rather arbitrary fashion. Usually the           experimenter performs visual clustering prior to drawing boundaries which        have no statistical prediction of successful classification.                     Visualization of complex multiparameter data is also difficult. One way          to deal with the visualization problem is to view the first three                principal components of the data and use this information to estimate the        number and approximate centroids for ""guided"" cluster analysis. Cluster          membership probabilities will then be used to make sort decisions.                                                                                                Another way to deal with the problem of placing sort boundaries on the           basis of arbitrary ""visual classifications"" is to apply statistical              methods of classifying cells, e.g. discriminant analysis with Bayes              decision boundaries. Discriminant functions will be calculated and Bayes         decision boundaries will be used to sort cells on the basis of                   discriminant function scores which will be calculated in real-time by            hardware and/or software lookup tables. A cost of misclassification will         also be included in the cell sorting decision.                                                                                                                    For all classifier systems developed, classifier performance will be             measured through ROC (""receiver operating characteristics"") analyses of          true-positives and false-positives. To accomplish this we will use a             well-defined system of data and model cell systems whereby all                   classifiers can be checked for correctness against ""tagged"" parameters.          All sorted model cells can be unequivocally identified by PCR (polymerase        chain reaction) or by FISH (fluorescence in-situ hybridization).                                                                                                  While the main focus of the proposal is to develop real-time cell                classifiers useful for cell sorting, many of the techniques can also be          used by other researchers for off-line analysis of conventional listmode         flow cytometry data.  Hence many of these techniques should prove                important to other researchers even if they are unable to perform the            sophisticated cell sorting described in this proposal.                                                                                                            To demonstrate the importance of these new techniques to many problems           in biology and medicine we will attempt to apply these new techniques to         several important applications including: (1) high-resolution sorting of         single fetal cells from human maternal blood for prenatal diagnosis; (2)         molecular characterizations of oncogene, tumor suppresser, metastatic,           and multi-drug resistance genes in rare human metastatic breast cancer           cells isolated from peripheral blood and bone marrow by high-speed               enrichment or high-resolution cell sorting; and (3) bone marrow purging          of metastatic cells to allow for autologous transplantations in breast           cancer patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy.

"LP AND NN BASED CLASSIFIERS FOR BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS Breast cancer is clearly a major public health concern. Currently, the           most effective method of detecting breast cancer is mammography. However,        while most mammographic abnormalities are benign, they must all be               confirmed by additional studies which may include additional mammograms,         ultrasound, and biopsy. A computer aided diagnostic (CAD) aide, which can        decrease the uncertainty inherent in the evaluation of mammograms, offers        the potential of sparing many women the trauma involved in undergoing            biopsies to confirm a diagnosis.                                                                                                                                  This SBIR proposal, submitted by Technology/Engineering Management, Inc.,        describes a research program to establish the feasibility of applying a          linear programming (LP) based pattern classifier to the computer aided           diagnosis of breast cancer. The ultimate goal of this research is to lay         the foundation for a software-based advisor that would serve as a                decision aide to the human diagnostician in assessing electronic images          of breast tumors, thereby enabling a totally noninvasive diagnosis.              Working in conjunction with a research team from the University of               Chicago Department of Radiology (UCDR), we plan to evaluate the efficacy         of the LP approach to discriminating malignant from benign lesions and           compare it to a mammography diagnostic aide that relies on an artificial         neural network (ANN) based classifier.

"OPTICAL PROCESSOR BASED CAD FOR MAMMOGRAPHY Much progress has been made in the fight against breast cancer through           early detection with screening mammography. Unfortunately, breast cancer         can be missed on mammograms due to the difficulty of interpretation and          inter-reader variability. For this reason, MedDetect, has worked to build        a hybrid optical and digital processor for the identification of                 potentially cancerous lesions on mammograms. The processor is comprised          of an optical correlator (OC) combined with a neural network (NN). It is         designed to mimic the radiologist - the OC being the eyes rapidly                scanning for areas of interest, and the NN being the brain making a              recommendation that the case is normal or has suspicious areas.                  MedDetect's proposed hybrid processor takes advantage of the best of both        worlds -- the best elements of optical processing and digital computing          to create a complete Computer-aided Diagnosis (CAD) system. Supporting           MedDetect in this effort are radiologists Drs. Brenner, Sadowsky, and            Levy, University of South Florida (Dr. L. Clarke) algorithm experts, and         optics experts at Lockheed Martin. If the proposed hypotheses are proven,        this innovative technology will be ready for rapid transition into the           clinical setting where it can assist radiologists in the early detection         of breast cancer.                                                                                                                                                 PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:                                                The proposed technology is responsive to a significant market. 25 million        mammograms are performed each year and the number is growing each year.          A similar volume of studies exists internationally. The ability to find          breast cancer more consistently and perhaps earlier is of great interest         to patients, radiologists, and payors. Thus, success with this research          should lead to significant business opportunities.

Artificial neural network (ANN) techniques will       be used to predict whether mammographically suspect lesions are benign, in       situ cancer, or invasive cancer.                                                                                                                                  The ANN inputs will be derived from existing, available information such as      patient history and radiologists descriptions of lesion morphology              following the ACR Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS).  ANNs      are well suited for this diagnostic task because, like humans, ANNs can be       taught to perform diagnostic tasks accurately and robustly when given            appropriate training examples.

Studies have shown that screening suffers from large variability in detection rates, and that radiologists do not identify all breast cancers that are visible upon retrospective review.  The ultimate goal of the proposed project is to develop and market intelligent software for mammogram image analysis to assist radiologists in detecting early stage breast cancer.  The software will prompt the radiologist to more carefully study computer-detected suspicious regions in the image which has been shown to improve detection rates of breast cancer.  The first specific aim of phase I is to combine previously developed software components which address subparts of the automated detection problem into a complete prototype capable of detecting abnormalities found in a screening environment.  This will be performed by company researchers who have extensive experience in this field. The second aim is to finalize clinical trial design for clinical testing to be carried out in phase II.

Accurate mammogram interpretation by                    radiologists is the key to the early detection of breast cancer. But,            it is still challenging for radiologists to maintain accurate and                efficient interpretation when given a massive volume of mammograms.

In this project,          the applicants proposed to develop a knowledge-based CAD scheme, to              optimize the scheme, and to evaluate scheme's performance for the                identification of breast abnormalities on digitized mammograms. The              design of the scheme includes a learning process to establish a                  knowledge base and an identification process to identify breast                  abnormalities on digitized mammograms.

"IMAGING NETWORK FOR BREAST CANCER MASS SCREENING   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose an internet-based dynamic           imaging system for detecting and monitoring changes in structural properties         of breast tissue that are indicative of breast cancer development.  The method       is based on the use of the proprietary Mechanical Imaging technology                 implemented in a small hand-held home-use self-palpation imaging device.  The        device is able to translate tissue's elastic properties into a digital map of        the breast, to objectively detect the presence of suspicious lesions and, if         necessary, to provide a woman with a warning signal ""see your doctor"".  Data         collected on a regular basis, e.g. once a week, will be sent via Internet to a       central database to form a four-dimensional (3-D plus time) image that will be       analyzed by a computer and a physician.  This project will lay a the                 foundation for a new approach to diagnostic medical imaging by adding the            temporal component to an image, by monitoring image changes over time using          data from an individual home-use device linked to a database.  The application       of machine-learning algorithms for developing a notion of ""individual norm""          for a particular woman using dynamic features of image and the image mining          will dramatically improve the sensitivity and diagnostic efficacy of the             imaging for a population wide screening.                                             PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The hand-held home-use Mechanical Imaging self-palpation device connected via Internet  to a central database will serve as a mass-screening tool for the primary detection of   breast cancer.  The convenience, efficacy and affordability of this technology will provide  the foundation for the development of new markets for a product that should be a necessary  item for every woman over 30 year of age with the market potential in excess of 1 billion  dollar per year in the US alone.

"Predicting breast cancer with ultrasound and mammography   DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): The purpose of this study is to increase        the specificity of breast biopsy by building computer models which combine both      mammography and breast ultrasound (US) findings to identify probably benign          breast masses. In current clinical practice, breast US is used only to               distinguish between fluid-filled cysts vs. solid masses. The proposed                artificial neural network (ANN) model would go one step further and                  quantitatively identify probably benign cases which may undergo short-term           follow-up in lieu of biopsy. The hypothesis is that by combining information         from both modalities, the model will be more robust and more accurate than           those based upon either modality alone, and be able to improve upon the              performance of the radiologists.                                                                                                                                          In preliminary studies, ANN models successfully identified probably benign           breast masses using just mammographic findings or just US findings.                                                                                                       The specific aims of the proposed study are to: 1. Prospectively collect data        for 300 cases of biopsy-proven breast lesions for which mammography and              ultrasound (US) data are both available. 2. Optimize artificial neural network       (ANN) models to identify probably lesions based on US findings only. 3. Develop      unified models to identify probably benign lesions using both US and                 mammography findings. 4. Perform statistical analysis to evaluate contribution       of US findings to the diagnostic performances of radiologists and ANN models.                                                                                             The immediate benefit of this proposal is a computer-based decision aid to           improve the specificity of breast biopsy and thus reduce the cost associated         with benign biopsies. This proposal has the potential to reduce significantly        the number of unnecessary breast biopsies and their associated cost, physical        pain, and emotional distress to the patient.

"Breast Cancer Risk Assessment with Bayesian Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Each year, a significant number of women in the United States are diagnosed with breast cancer. The ability to identify women at high risk for developing breast cancer as early as is possible would be invaluable for monitoring and management of this disease. As more information becomes available about the roles that different genetic, environmental, and personal health status factors play in determining breast cancer risk, it is important to develop methods for individualized breast cancer risk prediction that incorporate these factors. The goal of this application is to develop methods for individualized breast cancer risk prediction, using Bayesian networks with time dependencies, for women between the ages of 20 and 70 years. Bayesian networks provide methods for reasoning under conditions of uncertainty based on artificial intelligence and statistical principles. They allow for inclusion of expert opinion and empirical results from studies for a condition of interest. Specifically, we propose to (1) develop a Bayesian network based risk assessment tool for women aged 20 to 70 years, using knowledge provided by a panel of experts involved in cancer assessment and treatment research as well as relevant probabilities gleaned from the breast cancer literature; (2) perform a preliminary assessment of the accuracy of the risk assessment tool developed, using data obtained from 40 patients followed for at least 5 years through a high risk screening facility (the Yale Cancer Center Genetic Counseling Shared Resource); and (3) identify the steps required for a more formative validation of the risk assessment tool on a larger study population, and examine how the tool can be integrated with other quantitative methods designed for breast cancer risk prediction, such as Markov models.

"USE OF A TACTILE BREAST IMAGER FOR MASS PRE-SCREENING We propose a new Tactile Breast Imager (TBI) for early breast cancer detection intended for effective low-cost mass pre-screening. The device will build on developments made in the field of mechanical imaging (MI), a method that translates the tissue's elastic properties into a digital 3-D map of the tissue in the region of interest. It enables not only a superior method for clinical use, but also a powerful new paradigm of screening in which the patient collects data at home and efficiently transfers it to her physician for review. As is shown in this proposal, the underlying technology has been demonstrated to yield images of subcutaneous lesions that are well below the threshold of detectability by manual palpation. The proposed effort under this grant is to demonstrate that this technology may be incorporated into an easy to use form and determine the requisite skill and training requirements for robust data collection. The key developments necessary to achieve this goal lie in two categories: First is the development of the examination procedure and modification of equipment functionality to simplify the examination process. The ability to acquire sufficiently accurate data in a reliable manner depends largely on three aspects: the procedure in which the data is collected, the design of the equipment to facilitate this process, and subsequent processing of the data to minimize the effects of procedural and anatomical/physiological variations. While the majority of the necessary elements have already been developed to an adequately functional level, they are generally large and cumbersome and so would impede the ease of use of the TBI. The miniaturization and productization of the TBI probe and refinement of the data processing/transfer components is necessary. We aim to implement these developments in a prototype TBI and evaluate the resulting sensitivity for lesion detection a effectiveness and ease of use for both the clinical and home-use applications. Under Phase I grant we aim to develop an optical examination procedure, a suitable user/TBI interface design, and robust post procedure data processing algorithms to allow reliable and sensitive data to be obtained with minimal training. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The proposed TBI is an easy-to-use diagnostic tool that has the potential to effectively replace breast self-examination by health care professionals. The potential result is a significant decrease of the size of breast cancers at detection and consequently, more effective treatment, decrease in patient morbidity and mortality, and reduced health care costs.

"Breast Cancer Risk Assessment with Bayesian Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Each year, a significant number of women in the United States are diagnosed with breast cancer. The ability to identify women at high risk for developing breast cancer as early as is possible would be invaluable for monitoring and management of this disease. As more information becomes available about the roles that different genetic, environmental, and personal health status factors play in determining breast cancer risk, it is important to develop methods for individualized breast cancer risk prediction that incorporate these factors. The goal of this application is to develop methods for individualized breast cancer risk prediction, using Bayesian networks with time dependencies, for women between the ages of 20 and 70 years. Bayesian networks provide methods for reasoning under conditions of uncertainty based on artificial intelligence and statistical principles. They allow for inclusion of expert opinion and empirical results from studies for a condition of interest. Specifically, we propose to (1) develop a Bayesian network based risk assessment tool for women aged 20 to 70 years, using knowledge provided by a panel of experts involved in cancer assessment and treatment research as well as relevant probabilities gleaned from the breast cancer literature; (2) perform a preliminary assessment of the accuracy of the risk assessment tool developed, using data obtained from 40 patients followed for at least 5 years through a high risk screening facility (the Yale Cancer Center Genetic Counseling Shared Resource); and (3) identify the steps required for a more formative validation of the risk assessment tool on a larger study population, and examine how the tool can be integrated with other quantitative methods designed for breast cancer risk prediction, such as Markov models.

"NMR TECHNOLOGY FOR STRUCTURAL GENOMICS OF BREAST CANCER Genomics research is providing unprecedented access to expression vectors for thousands of proteins and it is critical to develop faster structure-determination technology to discover their cellular roles. Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful and widely used method to determine accurate protein structures, but is also time consuming. Progress in understanding eukaryotic mechanisms of replication, transcription and translation depends critically on gaining faster access to structures of domains and proteins identified in human and other genome projects. We propose new technology for fast protein structure determination by solution state NMR. We will develop and demonstrate this technology on the 127 residue bromodomain from yeast Sth1p. Bromodomain has been chosen for its relevance to the regulation of acetylation states of histones in eukaryotic DNA. The BrD stucture will yield insights into its roles in transcription activation and repression protein complexes and should help to clarify the role of acetylation regulation in carcinogenesis. We will transfer this technology to demonstrate high throughput determination of multiple structures associated with breast cancer gene sequences in collaboration with the newly established Harvard Structural Genomics of Cancer Initiative. We expect that discovery of new eukaryotic protein structures will lead to a reevaluation of targets identified for drug design and to new directions for cancer studies.

"Predicting breast cancer with ultrasound and mammography   DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): The purpose of this study is to increase        the specificity of breast biopsy by building computer models which combine both      mammography and breast ultrasound (US) findings to identify probably benign          breast masses. In current clinical practice, breast US is used only to               distinguish between fluid-filled cysts vs. solid masses. The proposed                artificial neural network (ANN) model would go one step further and                  quantitatively identify probably benign cases which may undergo short-term           follow-up in lieu of biopsy. The hypothesis is that by combining information         from both modalities, the model will be more robust and more accurate than           those based upon either modality alone, and be able to improve upon the              performance of the radiologists.                                                                                                                                          In preliminary studies, ANN models successfully identified probably benign           breast masses using just mammographic findings or just US findings.                                                                                                       The specific aims of the proposed study are to: 1. Prospectively collect data        for 300 cases of biopsy-proven breast lesions for which mammography and              ultrasound (US) data are both available. 2. Optimize artificial neural network       (ANN) models to identify probably lesions based on US findings only. 3. Develop      unified models to identify probably benign lesions using both US and                 mammography findings. 4. Perform statistical analysis to evaluate contribution       of US findings to the diagnostic performances of radiologists and ANN models.                                                                                             The immediate benefit of this proposal is a computer-based decision aid to           improve the specificity of breast biopsy and thus reduce the cost associated         with benign biopsies.

"Molecular Analysis of Human Breast Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many women with small, node-negative breast cancers are essentially overtreated. For example, most Stage I breast cancers are treated with both local and systemic therapies but approximately  80% are effectively cured with local interventions alone. Separating these patients from the approximately 20% who recur, irrespective of their treatment, remains problematic. Consequently, the development of novel methods that can more accurately predict for a nonrecurrent vs. recurrent phenotype is a major priority. We address this issue in our response to PAR-02-010, for which we have established an imaginative and integrated Bioengineering Research Partnership comprising three research teams (Bioengineering & Biostatistics; Clinical & Pathology; Microarray & Molecular Analysis) from two local sister universities (Georgetown University and The Catholic University of America) and the University of Edinburgh (Scotland). We will apply expression microarray and tissue array technologies and powerful new data analysis algorithms to define the gene expression profiles of 600 invasive breast tumors (Stages I-III). Our multidisciplinary teams will use these molecular profiles and established prognostic factors to build artificial intelligence-based classifiers and multivariate models that accurately predict those patients with nonmetastatic disease (especially Stage I) who will not recur. In the long terms, the genes in this classifier and the classifier's algorithms will be used to build custom diagnostic arrays and software for routine clinical use.    HYPOTHESES: We hypothesize that differences in the gene expression profiles of tumors determine outcome (recurrence) in patients with nonmetastatic disease. We also hypothesize that computational bioinformatics can discover these differences and use this knowledge to build classifiers that predict each patient's prognosis (especially in Stage I disease).    AIM 1: We will perform gene expression analysis on breast needle biopsies of 600 invasive, nonmetastatic breast tumors.    AIM 2: We will build an integrated data processing and management system for data acquisition and retrieval, to support the data analysis algorithms to be optimized and applied in Aim 3.    AIM 3: We will optimize and apply novel pattern recognition and information visualization technologies, recognizing the high dimensional nature of the data, to discover and validate gene subsets that separate recurrent from nonrecurrent tumors. We will integrate advanced artificial intelligence algorithms and biostatistical models to build predictive classifiers that can more accurately define cancer phenotypes and predict clinical outcomes.    AIM 4: We will use tissue arrays (multiple cores from archival tissues arrayed on glass slides) to validate and optimize the performance of these classifiers in a retrospective prognostic study of human breast tumors.

"Multispectral II-Plate Diffuse Optical Breast Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The long-range goal of this competing continuation grant is to assess and improve the breast tumor diagnostic capabilities of diffuse optical tomography with near infrared light. Near-infrared diffuse optical tomography is based on the study of functional processes, and provides several unique measurable parameters with potential to enhance breast tumor sensitivity and specificity. The techniques utilize non-ionizing radiation, are non-invasive, and are technologically simple and fast. Tissue optical absorption coefficients provide access to blood dynamics, total hemoglobin concentration, blood oxygen saturation, water concentration and lipid content. These tissue properties are often substantially different in rapidly growing tumors. During this proposal cycle we assembled a parallel-plate soft-compression apparatus for diffuse optical tomography of breast, and we have began pilot clinical studies with the instrument at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Our pilot studies have clearly shown tumors are detectable and characterizable with the diffuse optical method; they can even be tracked during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our proposed work emphasizes hardware and software improvements, and then pushes for more and deeper clinical studies. In particular we will upgrade the source switching apparatus and detection CCD in order to improve speed by approximately a factor of 4. This will increase our spectral coverage by approximately 4, given the same measurement time. We will upgrade the breast table to improve our idefinition of tissue boundaries and increase our sensitivity to breast tissue near the chest wall. We will upgrade our software for reconstruction in many ways, but most importantly in ways that reduce artifacts near boundaries. We will continue pilot studies on normal subjects and tumor bearing patients, this time with more specific supporting information from radiologists and pathologists, and finally, we will have a unique opportunity to follow a group of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. If successful, these powerful new improvements will enhance the fidelity of the breast images, and the anatomical and functional information generated by the device will improve our ability to detect and specify the nature of breast tumors.         ",Multispectral II-Plate Diffuse Optical Breast Tomography,6872740,R01EB002109,"['biomedical equipment development ', ' artificial intelligence ', ' diagnosis design /evaluation ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' human subject ', ' phantom model ', ' breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis ', ' mammography ', ' fiber optics ', ' image enhancement ', ' visible light ', ' female ', ' charge coupled device camera ', ' clinical research ', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging ', ' optical tomography ', ' three dimensional imaging /topography ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2004,559377,0.11118492591923745

"CAD in Breast MRI based on Biological Neural Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Standard techniques used in CAD for breast MRI are based on supervised artificial neural networks and have shown unsatisfactory discriminative results and limited application capabilities. The major disadvantages associated with these techniques are:  (1) requirement of a fixed MR imaging protocol, (2) difficulties in diagnosing small breast masses with a diameter of only a few mm, (3) incapacity of capturing the lesion structure, and (4) training limitations due to an inhomogeneous lesions data pool. To overcome the above mentioned problems, the theme of this research plan becomes to employ biological neural networks which focus strictly on the observed complete MRI signal time-series, and enable a self-organized data-driven segmentation of dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI time-series w.r.t. fine-grained differences of signal amplitude, and dynamics, such as focal enhancement in patients with indeterminate breast lesions. The goal of the present project is to improve in an interdisciplinary framework the diagnostic quality in breast MRI. Specifically, the objectives of this proposed project are to:  (1) develop, evaluate and test novel neural network techniques for functional and structural segmentation, visualization, and classification of dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI data, and thus, (2) substantially contribute to breast cancer diagnosis by improved further evaluation of suspicious lesions detected by conventional X-ray mammography.

"Multispectral II-Plate Diffuse Optical Breast Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The long-range goal of this competing continuation grant is to assess and improve the breast tumor diagnostic capabilities of diffuse optical tomography with near infrared light. Near-infrared diffuse optical tomography is based on the study of functional processes, and provides several unique measurable parameters with potential to enhance breast tumor sensitivity and specificity. The techniques utilize non-ionizing radiation, are non-invasive, and are technologically simple and fast. Tissue optical absorption coefficients provide access to blood dynamics, total hemoglobin concentration, blood oxygen saturation, water concentration and lipid content. These tissue properties are often substantially different in rapidly growing tumors. During this proposal cycle we assembled a parallel-plate soft-compression apparatus for diffuse optical tomography of breast, and we have began pilot clinical studies with the instrument at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Our pilot studies have clearly shown tumors are detectable and characterizable with the diffuse optical method; they can even be tracked during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our proposed work emphasizes hardware and software improvements, and then pushes for more and deeper clinical studies. In particular we will upgrade the source switching apparatus and detection CCD in order to improve speed by approximately a factor of 4. This will increase our spectral coverage by approximately 4, given the same measurement time. We will upgrade the breast table to improve our idefinition of tissue boundaries and increase our sensitivity to breast tissue near the chest wall. We will upgrade our software for reconstruction in many ways, but most importantly in ways that reduce artifacts near boundaries. We will continue pilot studies on normal subjects and tumor bearing patients, this time with more specific supporting information from radiologists and pathologists, and finally, we will have a unique opportunity to follow a group of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

"Reducing Benign Breast Biopsies with Computer Modeling DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The primary objective of this project is to improve the diagnosis of breast cancer and reduce unnecessary benign breast biopsies. An artificial neural network computer-aided 'advisor' will be constructed to assist radiologists in deciding which solid breast masses warrant immediate biopsy and which can be safely observed. Up to 80% of breast biopsies result in a benign diagnosis because benign and malignant masses often appear similar at mammography and sonography. We have previously developed computer models - artificial neural networks - for predicting breast cancer based on mammogram features and the patient's medical history. Models built with only mammography findings and the patient's age demonstrate good preliminary results, potentially eliminating 22% of benign biopsies while identifying all cancers. The principal innovative features of this project are: (1) the focus on solid breast masses by incorporating high-resolution ultrasound features, and (2) the use of a novel, standardized lexicon devised by the American College of Radiology for describing breast ultrasound findings. The goal of the proposed project is to maintain near perfect sensitivity (>98%) - similar to the accuracy of the present clinical practice of short-interval follow-up for 'probably benign' lesions - while theoretically reducing the number of biopsies of benign breast masses by half. Mammogram and ultrasound features will be established for a large retrospective database of approximately 1000 biopsy-proven cases. Artificial neural networks will be constructed with 'supervised' training to predict which masses are very likely benign and which are suspicious for malignancy. The computer predictive models will be tested on a prospective validation database of approximately 1350 cases with known biopsy results. Performance will be evaluated in terms of fraction of benign biopsies avoided while maintaining greater than 98% sensitivity. An interobserver variability study will determine whether the computer model reduces interpretation error and inconsistency between observers.

"CAD in Breast MRI based on Biological Neural Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Standard techniques used in CAD for breast MRI are based on supervised artificial neural networks and have shown unsatisfactory discriminative results and limited application capabilities. The major disadvantages associated with these techniques are:  (1) requirement of a fixed MR imaging protocol, (2) difficulties in diagnosing small breast masses with a diameter of only a few mm, (3) incapacity of capturing the lesion structure, and (4) training limitations due to an inhomogeneous lesions data pool. To overcome the above mentioned problems, the theme of this research plan becomes to employ biological neural networks which focus strictly on the observed complete MRI signal time-series, and enable a self-organized data-driven segmentation of dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI time-series w.r.t. fine-grained differences of signal amplitude, and dynamics, such as focal enhancement in patients with indeterminate breast lesions. The goal of the present project is to improve in an interdisciplinary framework the diagnostic quality in breast MRI. Specifically, the objectives of this proposed project are to:  (1) develop, evaluate and test novel neural network techniques for functional and structural segmentation, visualization, and classification of dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI data, and thus, (2) substantially contribute to breast cancer diagnosis by improved further evaluation of suspicious lesions detected by conventional X-ray mammography. The PI is an electrical and computer engineer with a background in pattern recognition who has been developing new classification methods derived from the newest biological discoveries aiming to imitate decision-making, and sensory processing in biological systems. This Mentored Quantitative Research Career Development Award will permit the PI to acquire training in cancer research techniques and in computer assisted radiology, and to use these skills to extend and productively apply these new theoretical tools to biomedical applications. Accordingly, the long-term career goal of the PI is to become an effective researcher in the biomedical applications of pattern recognition, with specific emphasis in computer-aided diagnosis.

"Molecular Analysis of Human Breast Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many women with small, node-negative breast cancers are essentially overtreated. For example, most Stage I breast cancers are treated with both local and systemic therapies but approximately  80% are effectively cured with local interventions alone. Separating these patients from the approximately 20% who recur, irrespective of their treatment, remains problematic. Consequently, the development of novel methods that can more accurately predict for a nonrecurrent vs. recurrent phenotype is a major priority. We address this issue in our response to PAR-02-010, for which we have established an imaginative and integrated Bioengineering Research Partnership comprising three research teams (Bioengineering & Biostatistics; Clinical & Pathology; Microarray & Molecular Analysis) from two local sister universities (Georgetown University and The Catholic University of America) and the University of Edinburgh (Scotland). We will apply expression microarray and tissue array technologies and powerful new data analysis algorithms to define the gene expression profiles of 600 invasive breast tumors (Stages I-III). Our multidisciplinary teams will use these molecular profiles and established prognostic factors to build artificial intelligence-based classifiers and multivariate models that accurately predict those patients with nonmetastatic disease (especially Stage I) who will not recur. In the long terms, the genes in this classifier and the classifier's algorithms will be used to build custom diagnostic arrays and software for routine clinical use.    HYPOTHESES: We hypothesize that differences in the gene expression profiles of tumors determine outcome (recurrence) in patients with nonmetastatic disease. We also hypothesize that computational bioinformatics can discover these differences and use this knowledge to build classifiers that predict each patient's prognosis (especially in Stage I disease).    AIM 1: We will perform gene expression analysis on breast needle biopsies of 600 invasive, nonmetastatic breast tumors.    AIM 2: We will build an integrated data processing and management system for data acquisition and retrieval, to support the data analysis algorithms to be optimized and applied in Aim 3.    AIM 3: We will optimize and apply novel pattern recognition and information visualization technologies, recognizing the high dimensional nature of the data, to discover and validate gene subsets that separate recurrent from nonrecurrent tumors. We will integrate advanced artificial intelligence algorithms and biostatistical models to build predictive classifiers that can more accurately define cancer phenotypes and predict clinical outcomes.    AIM 4: We will use tissue arrays (multiple cores from archival tissues arrayed on glass slides) to validate and optimize the performance of these classifiers in a retrospective prognostic study of human breast tumors.

"Machine Learning for Improved Mammography Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurate breast cancer screening demands that radiologists maintain a balance of high sensitivity and high specificity when interpreting mammography. Subspecialty-trained breast imagers perform significantly better than general radiologists by recognizing more breast cancers and minimizing benign biopsies. An automated reasoning system called a Bayesian network (BN), has the potential to improve the performance of general radiologists, who interpret the majority of mammograms, to the level of subspecialty-trained breast radiologists, who are in short supply. A BN is a probabilistic graphical model that has been used for decision support in a variety of domains, including radiology. Machine learning provides an appealing way to create and optimize BNs to perform at high levels of sensitivity and specificity. Our research group has developed a prototype, expert-defined BN that uses imaging features and demographic risk factors to classify abnormalities on mammograms as benign or malignant. Our BN can perform at a higher level than general radiologists, but our goal is for it to perform as well or better than subspecialty-trained breast radiologists. To this end, we have compiled a structured, multi-relational dataset of mammography abnormalities and pathologic outcomes from which cutting edge machine learning techniques can construct an improved BN. In the past, BNs were trained and tested on individual abnormalities in isolation. In fact, other abnormalities on the same mammogram or previous mammograms, which necessarily appear in other rows of a relational database, can further improve BN learning. We have used basic statistical relational learning (SRL) techniques to enhance Bayesian learning algorithms to leverage this important additional data. A novel SRL capability introduced by our team within the last year, called view learning, makes it possible to incorporate this related data from other parts of the database by automatically defining new database fields. In our preliminary work, we have shown a stepwise improvement in BN performance: first, with conventional BN learning; then, with basic SRL; and finally, with view learning. We now seek support to determine whether more tightly integrated SRL and view learning will significantly improve our BN's ability to accurately diagnose breast cancer. In addition, we propose to investigate whether two other promising machine learning techniques, predicate-invention and collective-classification, can optimize the BN to perform at levels significantly better than current clinical practice.           ",Machine Learning for Improved Mammography Screening,7248072,R01CA127379,"['Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Address ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Pathologic ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' Text ', ' Facility Construction Funding Category ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Foundations ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' human subject ', ' image processing ', ' Goals ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Link ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' radiologist ', ' RDST ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Exposure to ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Reading ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Specificity ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mtb infection [{C0041296}] ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' Class ', ' Biopsy ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' computer science ', ' Boxing ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Gur ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Glossary ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Multiple Abnormalities ', ' Modeling ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Accounting ', ' Communication ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' cost ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' Outcome ', ' prototype ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2007,289089,0.27502076083879823
"Molecular Fingerprinting of Breast Cancer Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Metabolomics is the study of cells by measuring profiles of all, or a large number, of their metabolites. Metabolomics was originally proposed as a method of functional genomics but its utility extends well beyond that - it is useful whenever an assessment of changes in metabolite levels is important. Metabolomics as a global approach is especially useful in identifying overall metabolic changes associated with breast cancer development and to identify most affected metabolites and metabolic networks.       In this project the progression of malignancy of breast epithelial cells will be characterized under normal as well as oxidative stress conditions with detailed molecular profiles. Robust molecular signatures that uniquely characterize early stages of malignant transformation will be developed using mathematical, statistical, and machine learning algorithms.       Fully malignant, intermediate and non-malignant breast epithelial cell cultures will be analyzed to obtain detailed molecular fingerprints. These fingerprints are processed with variable selection and discriminant analysis algorithms from which the determinant molecules for each stage of breast cancer development will be identified. To further increase the molecular detail of this approach, the cell cultures will be exposed to an oxidative stress caused by an appropriate concentration of cumene hydroperoxide, and subjected to the same data analysis workflow. The molecules identified as characteristic of each culture type, are important metabolic marker candidates for early stages of cancer development.

"Early Detection of Breast Cancer Using Autoantibody Mar*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  When cancer is identified at the earliest stages, the probability of cure is very high and therefore diagnostic screening tests that can detect these early stages are crucial.  Efforts toward the development of early detection assays for cancers have traditionally depended on single biomarker molecules.  Current technologies have been disappointing and have not resulted in diagnostic tests suitable for clinical practice.  The core technology of this project rests on research from the PI's lab in which he has developed a high throughput method to identify large numbers of epitopes that can be used to identify the presence of breast cancer by detecting the presence of auto-antibodies to tumor proteins in the serum of the test subject.  These biomarkers are cloned without a preconceived notion of their function and can be used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.  The essential features of the approach are acknowledging the heterogeneous nature of any specific kind of cancer, departing from the reliance on any single marker for disease detection, and using specialized bioinformatics techniques to interpret the results.  The concept employs pattern recognition of multiple markers as a diagnostic rather than any single marker.  This study is possible due to a remarkable specimen bank consisting of primary breast tumor tissues and sera collected frozen at the time of surgery from 1306 patients from Detroit metropolitan hospitals from 1975 to 1983.  In addition, follow-up sera were collected from participating patients through 1992.  Interview follow-ups were continued until 1996 and data forms from patient follow-ups are available.  Over 11,000 sera have been maintained at -70¿ C at the KCI facility and are still currently available for all primary samples.  In the discovery phase, the serum antibodies have been detected by screening of large numbers of potential epitope targets on protein microarrays.  By a unique combination of techniques to enhance detection (microarrays of bacteriophage-bearing displayed tumor antigens), this study proposes to investigate a novel serum assay to detect and predict outcomes for breast cancer.  The principle is that we can clone epitopes reacting with IgG in patients sera and use them to detect antibodies in sera to discriminate cancer and healthy subjects and detect disease prior to standard diagnosis.  Such an approach should provide an early detection assay for asymptomatic women.           ",Early Detection of Breast Cancer Using Autoantibody Mar*,7287417,U01CA117478,"['Protein Microchips ', ' Protein Microarray ', ' Protein Chips ', ' Protein Biochips ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' antigen binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Institution ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Early Detection Research Network ', ' National Detection Research Network ', ' EDRN ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Subgroup ', ' Antigen Targeting ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Phage Display ', ' Validation ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Preparation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Foundations ', ' Freezing ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Clinical ', ' Invasive ', ' Phase ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' IgG ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' prognostic ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Libraries ', ' Numbers ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Planet Mars ', ' Mars ', ' Funding ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Reliance ', ' Patients ', ' Antibodies ', ' Epitopes ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Printing ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Probability ', ' Staging ', ' Differentiation Antigens ', ' Marker Antigens ', ' Differentiation Markers ', ' Differentation Markers ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Nature ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Study of serum ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Tumor Antigens ', ' tumor-specific antigen ', ' Tumor-Associated Antigen ', ' Woman ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' Bacteriophages ', ' bacterial virus ', ' Phages ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Biologic Marker ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' cohort ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Breast Diseases ', ' mammary disorder ', ' Breast Disorder ', ' Complementary DNA ', ' cDNA ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Felis catus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Peptide Sequence Determination ', ' Protein Sequencing Molecular Biology ', ' Protein Sequencing ', ' Protein Sequence Determinations ', ' Amino Acid Sequence Determinations ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Sampling ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cloning ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' Communities ', ' Outcome ', ' tumor ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2007,944554,0.16276338669886628
"New Century Breast Cancer Diagnostics System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    In this project we hypothesize that a comprehensive clinical case library with intelligent agents can sort and render clinically similar cases and present clinically significant features, to assist the radiologist in interpreting mammograms. This computer library system is designed to integrate, search, and analyze clinical data that are analogous to the study case. In normal clinical practice, experienced radiologists often refer to their personal mental images of previous proven cases in making diagnoses and patient management decisions.  Providing a computerized library can refresh a radiologist's mental memory with a broad array of proven cases and concrete visualizations. The system can also assist less experienced radiologists in making diagnoses by referring them not only to histologically proven cases but also to the statistical distribution of features. Freed from bias induced by their recent experience, radiologists can use such a library system to improve the diagnostic accuracy at large. This approach differs greatly from conventional computer-aided detection (CAD) or computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) methods. One can also expect that by adding the radiologist's guidance - for example BI-RADS descriptors - into the proposed mammographic library system will lead to increase the searching accuracy and achieve a greater diagnostic outcome.  Technically speaking, this project differs from previous mammographic CADx and image-based retrieval methods in its emphasis on using local vector features and sector fuzzy features of the mammographic masses supported by our newly-invented maximum likelihood fuzzy shadow techniques and multiple circular path convolution neural network. In addition, the recent technical advances in image retrieval using the fuzzy feature matching method and hyper-space analysis techniques have made the success of the proposed approach highly possible.  This computer-based library system can be extended to include other imaging modalities for breast care.  It is conceivable that this comprehensive breast care database can further link local breast care centers through the coming high-speed network system. In addition, this system could also serve as a learning center for clinicians and scientists. This project represents a significant trend in the development of a comprehensive image data system for breast care in the next several decades.            ",New Century Breast Cancer Diagnostics System,7497321,R33CA102960,"['Diagnosis ', ' Computer aided diagnosis ', ' Computer-Assisted Diagnosis ', ' Ballistics ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Retrieval ', ' Subcategory ', ' Clinical Data ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Other Imaging Modalities ', ' Security ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fingers ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' Teleradiology ', ' Telemedicine ', ' Future ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Algorithms ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Link ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Intelligence ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Maryland ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Descriptor ', ' Nodule ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Printing ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Archives ', ' programs ', ' Specificity ', ' Statistical Distributions ', ' Arts ', ' Supervision ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Testing ', ' thorax radiography ', ' thoracic radiogram ', ' radiographic lung image ', ' radiographic chest image ', ' lung radiography ', ' chest radiography ', ' chest Xray ', ' chest X ray ', ' CXR ', ' Thoracic Radiography ', ' Scientist ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' One Step ', ' One-Step dentin bonding system ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' breast lesion ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Categories ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Today ', ' gun control ', ' firearm control ', ' gun control laws ', ' Shadowing (Histology) ', ' Shadowing ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Film ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Communication ', ' vector ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer imaging ', ' Cancerous ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' Computers ', ' ']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R33,2007,560186,0.19714477327308738
"Diagnosis of Breast Cancer with Optical Spectroscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Percutaneous, image-guided core needle biopsy is being increasingly used to diagnose breast lesions. Compared to surgical biopsy, this procedure is less invasive, less expensive, faster, minimizes deformity, leaves little or no scarring and requires a shorter time for recovery. However, core needle biopsy provides a limited sampling accuracy because only a few small pieces of tissue (for histological analysis) are extracted from random locations in the suspicious mass. The objective of the proposed research is to design a novel optical sensor based on fluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to improve the sampling accuracy of core needle biopsy. The sensor will potentially be able to survey multiple sites without the need for tissue removal and provide accurate and immediate feedback of optimal tissue sites for biopsy. The outcome of the proposed work will test the following two central hypotheses: (a) there exists a systematic and significant difference in the fluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectra of malignant and non-malignant (normal, benign) breast tissues, and (b) these differences can be exploited for breast cancer detection via a core biopsy needle. The specific aims of the proposed work are: (1) to measure fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) and diffuse reflectance spectra at several source-detector separations from breast tissues of patients undergoing breast cancer surgery, (2) to systematically identify a subset of the optical spectra, probe geometry and minimum signal-to-noise that display maximal differences between the normal, benign and malignant breast, and (3) use the knowledge derived from aims 1 and 2 to develop, characterize and validate a novel side-firing fiber-optic probe for breast cancer detection during core needle biopsy. The proposed work has a number of clinically significant implications. The optical sensor could potentially lead to fewer follow up procedures and fewer repeat biopsies in patients suspected to have breast cancer. Ultimately, the optical method may eliminate the need for surgical diagnosis of breast lesions altogether. Moreover, this technology could ultimately be used to guide in vivo therapeutic modalities such as laser ablation. The technology proposed in this application will be applicable to the detection of other deeply seated solid tumors, and the proposed clinical studies will serve as an important database for future technology development related to breast cancer detection.

"Discovery and Clinical Validation of Cancer Biomarkers Using Printed Glycan Array    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research is dedicated to the development and clinical validation of a serum-based diagnostic test for early detection of cancer and cancer risk. We have developed a printed glycan array (PGA) that detects a robust panel of cancer-specific anti-glycan autoantibodies in sera from cancer patients and at-risk patients. Aberrant glycosylation of proteins and lipids during malignant transformation results in the appearance of specific glycan structures known as Tumor Associated Carbohydrate Antigens, or TACAs, on cell surfaces and serum components. Combinations of TACAs are always present during malignant transformation and we have already demonstrated that multiple serum autoantibodies against these TACAs can be simultaneously detected using a PGA for patients with all stages of breast cancer including individuals with premalignant diseases. Using dedicated statistical and machine learning methods, we have identified sets of autoantibodies allowing differentiation of patients with metastatic breast cancer from healthy individuals. Although preliminary, these results allow us to conclude that PGAs together with our dedicated data processing methods can be used as a tool for the discovery of glyco-biomarkers, for the development of clinical serum-based screening tests for early detection of cancer and cancer risk, and for the evaluation of malignancy status. The three key components for advancing research have been established in our labratory: (1) in-house printing of custom glycan arrays, (2) PGA-dedicated mathematical data processing tools and (3) tumor-associated glycan discovery tools. The continued research will use the printed glycan array as a major biomarker-discovery technique. Further, the combined expertise of our team of investigators including glycobiologists, oncologists, mathematicians, clinical immunologists and chemists will use PGAs in large population-based studies with the following Specific Aims: 1. To identify and validate anti-glycan autoantibody signatures of the specific stages of breast cancer disease, including: increased breast cancer risk, pre-invasive (DCIS) and early breast cancer, breast cancer progression. 2. To expand the study to the identification and validation of anti-glycan autoantibody signatures for at least three other major malignancies, including ovarian, melanoma and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). 3. To identify, isolate and/or synthesize, and perform preliminary testing of novel tumor-associated glycans in serum and cellular materials as cancer-diagnostic antigens.          ",Discovery and Clinical Validation of Cancer Biomarkers Using Printed Glycan Array,7281031,U01CA128526,"['Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Breast Cancer Genetics ', ' Population ', ' tumor ', ' computerized data processing ', ' signal processing ', ' data processing ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Cancer Diagnostics ', ' Premalignant ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Custom ', ' Immunologist ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Housing ', ' Ovarian ', ' Clinical ', ' Invasive ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Laboratories ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Lipids ', ' melanoma ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Oncologist ', ' Patients ', ' Polysaccharides ', ' Glycans ', ' Printing ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Staging ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate ', ' Epitectin ', ' Carcinoma-Associated Antigen ', ' Cancer-Associated Carbohydrate Antigens ', ' CA(Oxford) Antigen ', ' CA Antigens ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Protein Glycosylation ', ' Testing ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' Techniques ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Biologic Marker ', ' cancer risk ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell surface ', ' Appearance ', ' ']",NCI,"CELLEXICON, INC.",U01,2007,423001,0.31185957696776617
"""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The availability of high-dimensional single-nucleotide (SNP) data for large samples of individuals with and without disease presents unprecedented opportunities for genetic epidemiologists, but also many statistical challenges. Our ability to bring these opportunities to fruition depends on the development and application of sound and innovative statistical methods. Areas of particularly great need include methods for dealing with multiple hypothesis-testing problems (multiple comparison issues), and methods for combining data from multiple sources to achieve sharper inferences (data synthesis issues). The goals of this research are to develop new or improved methods for addressing these issues, and to apply them to data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate. To accomplish these goals, the investigators will build on more than 15 years of previous work. Specifically, in 1988 the National Cancer Institute (NCI) awarded an Outstanding Investigator Grant (OIG) to the Principle Investigator for the development and application of new and improved statistical methods for use in epidemiological research. In 1995 this grant was renewed until NCI terminated the program in 2001. The research was then funded by R01 CA94069 for the period January 2002 to December 2006. This competing renewal application requests funds to continue this work and to apply it to new areas of emerging importance. The specific aims are fourfold: 1) to evaluate new and existing methods for controlling confounding and tail count variability in case-control genome-wide association (GWA) studies; 2) to evaluate risks associated with missense mutations of unknown significance in genes of established disease relevance; 3) to combine multiple independent sources of data in assessing the joint carcinogenic effects of groups of genes; and 4) to integrate data on tumor and patient characteristics for improved assessment of phenotype-specific etiology. We will evaluate the new methods by simulations, and we will illustrate them by application to existing data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate, and emerging data from GWA studies of breast and prostate cancer. The existing data have been collected either by the investigators and the consultants to this project, or as part of three collaborations in which the investigators participate: the Breast Cancer Family Registry (Breast-CFR), the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC), and the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG). In summary, we need sound, reliable methods for analyzing the vast amounts of emerging genetic data from individuals with and without a given type of cancer. The goals of this research are to develop such methods, and thereby to help generate new knowledge useful for cancer prevention and treatment.                                         ","""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""",7316902,R01CA094069,"['Critiques ', ' Data Sources ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' International ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Stratification ', ' Study Section ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Output ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Depth ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Incidence ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Funding ', ' Methods ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Ovary ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' tool ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' BRCA1 gene ', ' brca 1 gene ', ' RNF53 ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 1 Gene ', ' BRCA1 ', ' programs ', ' sound ', ' Suggestion ', ' Tail ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Award ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Penetrance ', ' BRCA2 gene ', ' brca 2 gene ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 2 ', ' FANCD1 ', ' FANCB ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 2 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 2 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 2 Gene ', ' BRCA2 ', ' Missense Mutation ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' simulation ', ' Glossary ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' cancer genetics ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Count ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' conditioning ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' breast cancer family ', ' Family-Based Registry ', ' family registry ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' user-friendly ', ' tumor ', ' Computer Programs and Programming ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,556597,0.10557800921911441
"Breast Cancer Risk Stratification with Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although risk for developing breast cancer at an earlier age is low in a substantial fraction of person-years lost it is attributed to women under the age of 40 who die from this disease. Unfortunately, screening mammography, the ""gold standard"" and accepted practice over the age of 40 for breast cancer detection, performs poorly in younger women and combined with radiation risk and expected low yield resulted in the recommendation that annual screening in the general population is not recommended below this age. Alternative imaging modalities exist (e.g. MRI, US), however, these techniques are not being used for this purpose for a variety of reasons. It would greatly facilitate breast cancer detection in younger women if an inexpensive, easy to use, widely available technology was available to pre-screen women and determine who would most likely benefit from more comprehensive imaging based studies. Currently, the only generally used screening tool in young women is Clinical Breast Exam (CBE). However, CBE has low sensitivity, high false- positive rate and is examiner dependent. Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a promising technology for fulfilling a pre-screening risk identification role as it relies on relatively inexpensive equipment that could be widely disseminated to practitioners' offices and it has demonstrated some effectiveness in detecting breast cancer regardless of age or breast density. Unfortunately, EIS technologies have demonstrated a relatively low sensitivity (~ 25 - 35%) when a high specificity (>90%) is required. Recently a new approach to EIS measurements has been developed and used quite successfully in non-medical applications. This new approach measures shifts in impedance near the resonant frequency when tissue is made a part of an RLC electric circuit. We refer to this new approach as Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS). The sensitivity of EIS near the resonant frequency is extremely high and we believe that using this approach (REIS) a much greater diagnostic performance can be achieved than was previously obtainable with EIS. In the R21 phase of this study we will build a prototype REIS device for rapidly evaluating (less than 10 minues) the breast and demonstrate feasibility for pre-screening women with the REIS device to determine who would benefit from a diagnostic imaging workup. This is not a breast cancer detection device but rather a risk stratification approach. Namely, the ultimate objective is to develop and test an approach that would segment the younger women population (< 40 years old) into two groups. One (REIS negative) that is expected to have normal risk of having breast cancer and the other (REIS positive) which identifies a group of women in which the risk of having breast cancer is substantially higher than in older women (40 - 49 years old) who are currently routinely screened. In the R33 phase a much larger patient population will be recruited and will be used to optimize the classification algorithm. Comparisons will be made with existing EIS technology. In this application we are proposing building and evaluating a device for identifying pre-menopausal women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and would thus benefit from an imaging based evaluation of the breast. This would be achieved using a low cost, safe technology that could be used during routine office visits of young women who are not screened with mammography. If successful, this proposal will have a large public health impact via increased early detection of breast cancer.          ",Breast Cancer Risk Stratification with Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy,7239026,R21CA127169,"['sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Premenopause ', ' pre-menopausal ', ' Premenopausal Period ', ' Premenopausal ', ' Pre-menopausal Period ', ' Pre-Menopause ', ' Incidence ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Numbers ', ' Measurement ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Persons ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' Noise ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Patients ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Exposure to ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Western World ', ' Specificity ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Woman ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Palpable ', ' palpable disease ', ' Biopsy ', ' age group ', ' cancer risk ', ' Performance ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Categories ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Measures ', ' Radiation ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' older women ', ' prototype ', ' Drops ', ' Skin ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Purpose ', ' Address ', ' Equipment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Subgroup ', ' in vivo ', ' Genetic Programming ', ' Genetic Algorithm ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Rate ', ' Modification ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Placement ', ' electric impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' breast density ', ' Foundations ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Gold ', ' Au element ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2007,122148,0.33541818073568186
"Molecular Analysis of Human Breast Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many women with small, node-negative breast cancers are essentially overtreated. For example, most Stage I breast cancers are treated with both local and systemic therapies but approximately  80% are effectively cured with local interventions alone. Separating these patients from the approximately 20% who recur, irrespective of their treatment, remains problematic. Consequently, the development of novel methods that can more accurately predict for a nonrecurrent vs. recurrent phenotype is a major priority. We address this issue in our response to PAR-02-010, for which we have established an imaginative and integrated Bioengineering Research Partnership comprising three research teams (Bioengineering & Biostatistics; Clinical & Pathology; Microarray & Molecular Analysis) from two local sister universities (Georgetown University and The Catholic University of America) and the University of Edinburgh (Scotland). We will apply expression microarray and tissue array technologies and powerful new data analysis algorithms to define the gene expression profiles of 600 invasive breast tumors (Stages I-III). Our multidisciplinary teams will use these molecular profiles and established prognostic factors to build artificial intelligence-based classifiers and multivariate models that accurately predict those patients with nonmetastatic disease (especially Stage I) who will not recur. In the long terms, the genes in this classifier and the classifier's algorithms will be used to build custom diagnostic arrays and software for routine clinical use.    HYPOTHESES: We hypothesize that differences in the gene expression profiles of tumors determine outcome (recurrence) in patients with nonmetastatic disease. We also hypothesize that computational bioinformatics can discover these differences and use this knowledge to build classifiers that predict each patient's prognosis (especially in Stage I disease).    AIM 1: We will perform gene expression analysis on breast needle biopsies of 600 invasive, nonmetastatic breast tumors.    AIM 2: We will build an integrated data processing and management system for data acquisition and retrieval, to support the data analysis algorithms to be optimized and applied in Aim 3.    AIM 3: We will optimize and apply novel pattern recognition and information visualization technologies, recognizing the high dimensional nature of the data, to discover and validate gene subsets that separate recurrent from nonrecurrent tumors. We will integrate advanced artificial intelligence algorithms and biostatistical models to build predictive classifiers that can more accurately define cancer phenotypes and predict clinical outcomes.    AIM 4: We will use tissue arrays (multiple cores from archival tissues arrayed on glass slides) to validate and optimize the performance of these classifiers in a retrospective prognostic study of human breast tumors.

"Cancer Risks in Multi-ethnic Carriers of Unclassified BRCA1 Variants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein inactivating mutations of the BRCA1 gene are associated with elevated breast and ovarian cancer risks. However there is considerable uncertainty about the effects of other BRCA1 variants, particularly the single base changes that alter amino acids of the protein, termed nonsynonymous unclassified variants (ns UCVs). Because these variants are rare, no single source of data is sufficiently informative to unambiguously classify them as either neutral or pathogenic. Our goal is to assess the feasibility of adding useful new information about the risks of ns UCVs of BRCA1 by assessing cancer incidence in first-degree (FD) relatives of a population-based multi-ethnic series of incident breast cancer cases with and without ns UCVs. Our specific aims are: 1) to compare the prevalence and types of ns UCVs detected among Hispanic, Asian- American, African-American and non-Hispanic white (NHW) breast cancer cases ascertained from the Northern California component of the Breast Cancer Family Registry (Breast CFR); 2) to estimate risk ratios and standardized residuals for BRCA1-related cancers among FD relatives of 66 cases who carry ns UCVs, compared to those of 1729 cases who carry at most neutral polymorphisms; 3) to combine results of Aim 2 with available pathogenicity scores of the variants to classify them as benign or deleterious; and 4) to evaluate agreement between this classification and one obtained using a function-based statistical learning algorithm. Our ultimate goal is to assess the potential of using cancer incidence in relatives of carriers to help classify other variants in disease-susceptibility genes. If we find that the results of this feasibility study are promising, we will seek separate funding to extend it to other UCVs of BRCA1 and BRCA2, using a larger series of population-based families from the Breast CFR and other population-based breast and ovarian cancer family registries. The risks associated with unclassified variants of established disease-susceptibility genes have important clinical implications, particularly for Hispanic and nonwhite populations, whose risks have not been extensively studied. This study will examine the feasibility of adding new information about these risks using cancer data from relatives of variant carriers.          ",Cancer Risks in Multi-ethnic Carriers of Unclassified BRCA1 Variants,7387179,R03CA132155,"['Data Sources ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Mismatch Repair ', ' Post-Replication Mismatch Repair ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' Normal Cell ', ' BRCA1 Mutation ', ' BRCA1 gene mutation ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Family ', ' First Degree Relative ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Rate ', ' Exons ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Genes ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Algorithms ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Incidence ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Funding ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Oncogenes ', ' Transforming Genes ', ' Cancer-Promoting Gene ', ' Cancer Genes ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Nature ', ' Risk ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' BRCA1 gene ', ' brca 1 gene ', ' RNF53 ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 1 Gene ', ' BRCA1 ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Severities ', ' Score ', ' cancer risk ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' BRCA2 gene ', ' brca 2 gene ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 2 ', ' FANCD1 ', ' FANCB ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 2 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 2 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 2 Gene ', ' BRCA2 ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' California ', ' Agreement ', ' Glossary ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Disease regression ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' case control ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' breast cancer family ', ' Family-Based Registry ', ' family registry ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R03,2007,79000,0.1401773473327256
"Discovery and Clinical Validation of Cancer Biomarkers Using Printed Glycan Array    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research is dedicated to the development and clinical validation of a serum-based diagnostic test for early detection of cancer and cancer risk. We have developed a printed glycan array (PGA) that detects a robust panel of cancer-specific anti-glycan autoantibodies in sera from cancer patients and at-risk patients. Aberrant glycosylation of proteins and lipids during malignant transformation results in the appearance of specific glycan structures known as Tumor Associated Carbohydrate Antigens, or TACAs, on cell surfaces and serum components. Combinations of TACAs are always present during malignant transformation and we have already demonstrated that multiple serum autoantibodies against these TACAs can be simultaneously detected using a PGA for patients with all stages of breast cancer including individuals with premalignant diseases. Using dedicated statistical and machine learning methods, we have identified sets of autoantibodies allowing differentiation of patients with metastatic breast cancer from healthy individuals. Although preliminary, these results allow us to conclude that PGAs together with our dedicated data processing methods can be used as a tool for the discovery of glyco-biomarkers, for the development of clinical serum-based screening tests for early detection of cancer and cancer risk, and for the evaluation of malignancy status. The three key components for advancing research have been established in our labratory: (1) in-house printing of custom glycan arrays, (2) PGA-dedicated mathematical data processing tools and (3) tumor-associated glycan discovery tools. The continued research will use the printed glycan array as a major biomarker-discovery technique. Further, the combined expertise of our team of investigators including glycobiologists, oncologists, mathematicians, clinical immunologists and chemists will use PGAs in large population-based studies with the following Specific Aims: 1. To identify and validate anti-glycan autoantibody signatures of the specific stages of breast cancer disease, including: increased breast cancer risk, pre-invasive (DCIS) and early breast cancer, breast cancer progression. 2. To expand the study to the identification and validation of anti-glycan autoantibody signatures for at least three other major malignancies, including ovarian, melanoma and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). 3.

"A computer model to improve breast cancer diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests K07 support for Dr. Elizabeth Burnside to become an independent investigator and leader in the use of computer models to improve the early detection of breast cancer. This award will allow Dr. Burnside to optimize and validate a computer model called a Bayesian network designed to provide decision-support for radiologists interpreting mammography. This project is a multidisciplinary effort integrating computer science, applied medical informatics, population health science and breast imaging. The University of Wisconsin is an ideal environment for this work because it provides access to renowned researchers in these areas and individuals experienced with the inclusion of diverse populations in women's health research. To achieve these research and career goals, the candidate will follow a career development plan that consists of 1) acquisition of advanced research competencies in artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, probability theory, Bayesian reasoning, research ethics, and clinical trial design; 2) mentorship from nationally and internationally recognized experts; and 3) innovative research in computer-aided decision support in breast cancer diagnosis. The current state of breast cancer screening reveals a wide variability of practice and a shortage of expert mammographers. Dr. Burnside's model envisions using expert knowledge to improve non- expert performance in mammography. The model complements current computer-assisted detection algorithms by contributing information to crucial post-discovery aspects of mammography: interpretation and decision-making. Using probability theory, the model defines relationships between a patient's demographic risk factors, her mammographic findings, and diseases of the breast to generate a breast cancer risk assessment uniquely tailored to her. If successful, the model will improve the accuracy of decision-making, decrease the human costs of underperformance and variability, and deliver personalized medicine to patients who undergo mammography.

"Early Detection of Breast Cancer Using Autoantibody Mar*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  When cancer is identified at the earliest stages, the probability of cure is very high and therefore diagnostic screening tests that can detect these early stages are crucial.  Efforts toward the development of early detection assays for cancers have traditionally depended on single biomarker molecules.  Current technologies have been disappointing and have not resulted in diagnostic tests suitable for clinical practice.  The core technology of this project rests on research from the PI's lab in which he has developed a high throughput method to identify large numbers of epitopes that can be used to identify the presence of breast cancer by detecting the presence of auto-antibodies to tumor proteins in the serum of the test subject.  These biomarkers are cloned without a preconceived notion of their function and can be used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.  The essential features of the approach are acknowledging the heterogeneous nature of any specific kind of cancer, departing from the reliance on any single marker for disease detection, and using specialized bioinformatics techniques to interpret the results.  The concept employs pattern recognition of multiple markers as a diagnostic rather than any single marker.  This study is possible due to a remarkable specimen bank consisting of primary breast tumor tissues and sera collected frozen at the time of surgery from 1306 patients from Detroit metropolitan hospitals from 1975 to 1983.  In addition, follow-up sera were collected from participating patients through 1992.  Interview follow-ups were continued until 1996 and data forms from patient follow-ups are available.  Over 11,000 sera have been maintained at -70¿ C at the KCI facility and are still currently available for all primary samples.  In the discovery phase, the serum antibodies have been detected by screening of large numbers of potential epitope targets on protein microarrays.  By a unique combination of techniques to enhance detection (microarrays of bacteriophage-bearing displayed tumor antigens), this study proposes to investigate a novel serum assay to detect and predict outcomes for breast cancer.  The principle is that we can clone epitopes reacting with IgG in patients sera and use them to detect antibodies in sera to discriminate cancer and healthy subjects and detect disease prior to standard diagnosis.  Such an approach should provide an early detection assay for asymptomatic women.           ",Early Detection of Breast Cancer Using Autoantibody Mar*,7488997,U01CA117478,"['Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Felis catus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Peptide Sequence Determination ', ' Protein Sequencing Molecular Biology ', ' Protein Sequencing ', ' Protein Sequence Determinations ', ' Amino Acid Sequence Determinations ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Sampling ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cloning ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' Communities ', ' Outcome ', ' tumor ', ' Protein Microchips ', ' Protein Microarray ', ' Protein Chips ', ' Protein Biochips ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' antigen binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Institution ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Early Detection Research Network ', ' National Detection Research Network ', ' EDRN ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Subgroup ', ' Antigen Targeting ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Phage Display ', ' Validation ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Preparation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Foundations ', ' Freezing ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Clinical ', ' Invasive ', ' Phase ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' IgG ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' prognostic ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Libraries ', ' Numbers ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Planet Mars ', ' Mars ', ' Funding ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Reliance ', ' Patients ', ' Antibodies ', ' Epitopes ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Printing ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Probability ', ' Staging ', ' Differentiation Antigens ', ' Marker Antigens ', ' Differentiation Markers ', ' Differentation Markers ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Nature ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Study of serum ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Tumor Antigens ', ' tumor-specific antigen ', ' Tumor-Associated Antigen ', ' Woman ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' Bacteriophages ', ' bacterial virus ', ' Phages ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Biologic Marker ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' cohort ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Breast Diseases ', ' mammary disorder ', ' Breast Disorder ', ' Complementary DNA ', ' cDNA ', ' novel ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2008,703194,0.16276338669886628
"Breast Cancer Risk Stratification with Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although risk for developing breast cancer at an earlier age is low in a substantial fraction of person-years lost it is attributed to women under the age of 40 who die from this disease. Unfortunately, screening mammography, the ""gold standard"" and accepted practice over the age of 40 for breast cancer detection, performs poorly in younger women and combined with radiation risk and expected low yield resulted in the recommendation that annual screening in the general population is not recommended below this age. Alternative imaging modalities exist (e.g. MRI, US), however, these techniques are not being used for this purpose for a variety of reasons. It would greatly facilitate breast cancer detection in younger women if an inexpensive, easy to use, widely available technology was available to pre-screen women and determine who would most likely benefit from more comprehensive imaging based studies. Currently, the only generally used screening tool in young women is Clinical Breast Exam (CBE). However, CBE has low sensitivity, high false- positive rate and is examiner dependent. Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a promising technology for fulfilling a pre-screening risk identification role as it relies on relatively inexpensive equipment that could be widely disseminated to practitioners' offices and it has demonstrated some effectiveness in detecting breast cancer regardless of age or breast density. Unfortunately, EIS technologies have demonstrated a relatively low sensitivity (~ 25 - 35%) when a high specificity (>90%) is required. Recently a new approach to EIS measurements has been developed and used quite successfully in non-medical applications. This new approach measures shifts in impedance near the resonant frequency when tissue is made a part of an RLC electric circuit. We refer to this new approach as Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS). The sensitivity of EIS near the resonant frequency is extremely high and we believe that using this approach (REIS) a much greater diagnostic performance can be achieved than was previously obtainable with EIS. In the R21 phase of this study we will build a prototype REIS device for rapidly evaluating (less than 10 minues) the breast and demonstrate feasibility for pre-screening women with the REIS device to determine who would benefit from a diagnostic imaging workup. This is not a breast cancer detection device but rather a risk stratification approach. Namely, the ultimate objective is to develop and test an approach that would segment the younger women population (< 40 years old) into two groups. One (REIS negative) that is expected to have normal risk of having breast cancer and the other (REIS positive) which identifies a group of women in which the risk of having breast cancer is substantially higher than in older women (40 - 49 years old) who are currently routinely screened. In the R33 phase a much larger patient population will be recruited and will be used to optimize the classification algorithm. Comparisons will be made with existing EIS technology. In this application we are proposing building and evaluating a device for identifying pre-menopausal women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and would thus benefit from an imaging based evaluation of the breast. This would be achieved using a low cost, safe technology that could be used during routine office visits of young women who are not screened with mammography. If successful, this proposal will have a large public health impact via increased early detection of breast cancer.          ",Breast Cancer Risk Stratification with Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy,7391203,R21CA127169,"['Skin ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Purpose ', ' Address ', ' Equipment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Subgroup ', ' in vivo ', ' Genetic Programming ', ' Genetic Algorithm ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Rate ', ' Modification ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Placement ', ' electric impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' breast density ', ' Foundations ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Gold ', ' Au element ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Premenopause ', ' pre-menopausal ', ' Premenopausal Period ', ' Premenopausal ', ' Pre-menopausal Period ', ' Pre-Menopause ', ' Incidence ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Numbers ', ' Measurement ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Persons ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' Noise ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Patients ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Exposure to ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Western World ', ' Specificity ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Woman ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Palpable ', ' palpable disease ', ' Biopsy ', ' age group ', ' cancer risk ', ' Performance ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Categories ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Measures ', ' Radiation ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' older women ', ' prototype ', ' Drops ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2008,169783,0.33541818073568186
"Using Markov Decision Processes to Optimize Breast Biopsy Decision Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary Early diagnosis through screening mammography is the most effective means of decreasing the death rate from breast cancer. While mammography is inexpensive, the interventional procedures that result from detected abnormalities (both false and true positives) increase the cost of this population-based screening program significantly. In fact, breast biopsy actually delivers a benign result in over 80% of cases making it the most costly per capita component of a breast cancer screening program. If a mammogram reports a suspicious finding, then a biopsy is required to decide whether an abnormality is in fact a breast cancer. A false positive mammogram exposes the patient to the anxiety, pain, and possible complications while the health care system bears the cost of potentially unnecessary biopsies. Our previous research has developed a probabilistic computer model called the Mammography Bayesian Network (MBN) that calculates the risk of breast disease based on demographic risk factors and mammography findings. The objective of this research is to optimize the biopsy decisions for breast-cancer patients such that the early diagnosis of invasive breast cancer is improved while unnecessary invasive procedures are minimized. We will calibrate our previously developed MBN, to accurately calculate the risk of breast cancer based on demographic risk factors and mammography findings. We will use Markov decision processes, an advanced decision analysis technique that is used for decision- making under uncertainty, to find the optimal probability thresholds for the decision to perform breast biopsy for patients with different age groups. We will determine whether these optimal probability thresholds change with patient age.  Relevance of this research to Public Health: The proposed research will improve the interpretation of screening mammography, the most effective means of decreasing the death rate from breast cancer, which affects millions of women in the US. Any improvement in screening mammography will reduce the costs of unnecessary biopsies to the society.          ",Using Markov Decision Processes to Optimize Breast Biopsy Decision Making,7385606,R21CA129393,"['Decision Analysis ', ' Decision Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Process ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Benign ', ' Invasive ', ' Death Rate ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Anxiety ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Societies ', ' programs ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Woman ', ' Techniques ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Biopsy ', ' age group ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Breast Diseases ', ' mammary disorder ', ' Breast Disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' Skin Cancer ', ' malignant skin tumor ', ' Malignant Skin Neoplasm ', ' Modeling ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' cost ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' Population ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2008,185293,0.3193323056359232
"New Century Breast Cancer Diagnostics System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    In this project we hypothesize that a comprehensive clinical case library with intelligent agents can sort and render clinically similar cases and present clinically significant features, to assist the radiologist in interpreting mammograms. This computer library system is designed to integrate, search, and analyze clinical data that are analogous to the study case. In normal clinical practice, experienced radiologists often refer to their personal mental images of previous proven cases in making diagnoses and patient management decisions.  Providing a computerized library can refresh a radiologist's mental memory with a broad array of proven cases and concrete visualizations. The system can also assist less experienced radiologists in making diagnoses by referring them not only to histologically proven cases but also to the statistical distribution of features. Freed from bias induced by their recent experience, radiologists can use such a library system to improve the diagnostic accuracy at large. This approach differs greatly from conventional computer-aided detection (CAD) or computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) methods. One can also expect that by adding the radiologist's guidance - for example BI-RADS descriptors - into the proposed mammographic library system will lead to increase the searching accuracy and achieve a greater diagnostic outcome.  Technically speaking, this project differs from previous mammographic CADx and image-based retrieval methods in its emphasis on using local vector features and sector fuzzy features of the mammographic masses supported by our newly-invented maximum likelihood fuzzy shadow techniques and multiple circular path convolution neural network. In addition, the recent technical advances in image retrieval using the fuzzy feature matching method and hyper-space analysis techniques have made the success of the proposed approach highly possible.  This computer-based library system can be extended to include other imaging modalities for breast care.  It is conceivable that this comprehensive breast care database can further link local breast care centers through the coming high-speed network system. In addition, this system could also serve as a learning center for clinicians and scientists. This project represents a significant trend in the development of a comprehensive image data system for breast care in the next several decades.            ",New Century Breast Cancer Diagnostics System,7499601,R33CA102960,"['Diagnosis ', ' Computer-Assisted Diagnosis ', ' Computer aided diagnosis ', ' Ballistics ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Retrieval ', ' Subcategory ', ' Clinical Data ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Other Imaging Modalities ', ' Security ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Fingers ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' Teleradiology ', ' Telemedicine ', ' Future ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Link ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Intelligence ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' Maryland ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Medical Informatics ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' radiologist ', ' RDST ', ' Descriptor ', ' Nodule ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Printing ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Science ', ' Archives ', ' programs ', ' Specificity ', ' Statistical Distributions ', ' Arts ', ' Supervision ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Testing ', ' Thoracic Radiography ', ' thorax radiography ', ' thoracic radiogram ', ' radiographic lung image ', ' radiographic chest image ', ' lung radiography ', ' chest radiography ', ' chest Xray ', ' chest X ray ', ' CXR ', ' Scientist ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' One-Step dentin bonding system ', ' One Step ', ' Today ', ' gun control laws ', ' gun control ', ' firearm control ', ' Shadowing (Histology) ', ' Shadowing ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Film ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Communication ', ' vector ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer imaging ', ' Cancerous ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' Computers ', ' interest ', ' Medical center ', ' breast lesion ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Categories ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' ']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R33,2008,567767,0.19714477327308738
"""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The availability of high-dimensional single-nucleotide (SNP) data for large samples of individuals with and without disease presents unprecedented opportunities for genetic epidemiologists, but also many statistical challenges. Our ability to bring these opportunities to fruition depends on the development and application of sound and innovative statistical methods. Areas of particularly great need include methods for dealing with multiple hypothesis-testing problems (multiple comparison issues), and methods for combining data from multiple sources to achieve sharper inferences (data synthesis issues). The goals of this research are to develop new or improved methods for addressing these issues, and to apply them to data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate. To accomplish these goals, the investigators will build on more than 15 years of previous work. Specifically, in 1988 the National Cancer Institute (NCI) awarded an Outstanding Investigator Grant (OIG) to the Principle Investigator for the development and application of new and improved statistical methods for use in epidemiological research. In 1995 this grant was renewed until NCI terminated the program in 2001. The research was then funded by R01 CA94069 for the period January 2002 to December 2006. This competing renewal application requests funds to continue this work and to apply it to new areas of emerging importance. The specific aims are fourfold: 1) to evaluate new and existing methods for controlling confounding and tail count variability in case-control genome-wide association (GWA) studies; 2) to evaluate risks associated with missense mutations of unknown significance in genes of established disease relevance; 3) to combine multiple independent sources of data in assessing the joint carcinogenic effects of groups of genes; and 4) to integrate data on tumor and patient characteristics for improved assessment of phenotype-specific etiology. We will evaluate the new methods by simulations, and we will illustrate them by application to existing data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate, and emerging data from GWA studies of breast and prostate cancer. The existing data have been collected either by the investigators and the consultants to this project, or as part of three collaborations in which the investigators participate: the Breast Cancer Family Registry (Breast-CFR), the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC), and the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG). In summary, we need sound, reliable methods for analyzing the vast amounts of emerging genetic data from individuals with and without a given type of cancer. The goals of this research are to develop such methods, and thereby to help generate new knowledge useful for cancer prevention and treatment.                                         ","""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""",7475833,R01CA094069,"['Critiques ', ' Data Sources ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' International ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Stratification ', ' Study Section ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Output ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Depth ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Incidence ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Funding ', ' Methods ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Ovary ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' tool ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' BRCA1 gene ', ' brca 1 gene ', ' RNF53 ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 1 Gene ', ' BRCA1 ', ' programs ', ' sound ', ' Suggestion ', ' Tail ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Award ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Penetrance ', ' BRCA2 gene ', ' brca 2 gene ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 2 ', ' FANCD1 ', ' FANCB ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 2 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 2 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 2 Gene ', ' BRCA2 ', ' Missense Mutation ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' simulation ', ' Glossary ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' cancer genetics ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Count ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' conditioning ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' breast cancer family ', ' Family-Based Registry ', ' family registry ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' user-friendly ', ' tumor ', ' Computer Programs and Programming ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,560698,0.10557800921911441
"Machine Learning for Improved Mammography Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurate breast cancer screening demands that radiologists maintain a balance of high sensitivity and high specificity when interpreting mammography. Subspecialty-trained breast imagers perform significantly better than general radiologists by recognizing more breast cancers and minimizing benign biopsies. An automated reasoning system called a Bayesian network (BN), has the potential to improve the performance of general radiologists, who interpret the majority of mammograms, to the level of subspecialty-trained breast radiologists, who are in short supply. A BN is a probabilistic graphical model that has been used for decision support in a variety of domains, including radiology. Machine learning provides an appealing way to create and optimize BNs to perform at high levels of sensitivity and specificity. Our research group has developed a prototype, expert-defined BN that uses imaging features and demographic risk factors to classify abnormalities on mammograms as benign or malignant. Our BN can perform at a higher level than general radiologists, but our goal is for it to perform as well or better than subspecialty-trained breast radiologists. To this end, we have compiled a structured, multi-relational dataset of mammography abnormalities and pathologic outcomes from which cutting edge machine learning techniques can construct an improved BN. In the past, BNs were trained and tested on individual abnormalities in isolation. In fact, other abnormalities on the same mammogram or previous mammograms, which necessarily appear in other rows of a relational database, can further improve BN learning. We have used basic statistical relational learning (SRL) techniques to enhance Bayesian learning algorithms to leverage this important additional data. A novel SRL capability introduced by our team within the last year, called view learning, makes it possible to incorporate this related data from other parts of the database by automatically defining new database fields. In our preliminary work, we have shown a stepwise improvement in BN performance: first, with conventional BN learning; then, with basic SRL; and finally, with view learning. We now seek support to determine whether more tightly integrated SRL and view learning will significantly improve our BN's ability to accurately diagnose breast cancer. In addition, we propose to investigate whether two other promising machine learning techniques, predicate-invention and collective-classification, can optimize the BN to perform at levels significantly better than current clinical practice.           ",Machine Learning for Improved Mammography Screening,7406091,R01CA127379,"['Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Address ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Pathologic ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' Text ', ' Facility Construction Funding Category ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Foundations ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' human subject ', ' image processing ', ' Goals ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Link ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' radiologist ', ' RDST ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Exposure to ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Reading ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Specificity ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mtb infection [{C0041296}] ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' Class ', ' Biopsy ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' computer science ', ' Boxing ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Gur ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Glossary ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Multiple Abnormalities ', ' Modeling ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Accounting ', ' Communication ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' cost ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' Outcome ', ' prototype ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2008,272311,0.27502076083879823
"Molecular Fingerprinting of Breast Cancer Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Metabolomics is the study of cells by measuring profiles of all, or a large number, of their metabolites. Metabolomics was originally proposed as a method of functional genomics but its utility extends well beyond that - it is useful whenever an assessment of changes in metabolite levels is important. Metabolomics as a global approach is especially useful in identifying overall metabolic changes associated with breast cancer development and to identify most affected metabolites and metabolic networks.       In this project the progression of malignancy of breast epithelial cells will be characterized under normal as well as oxidative stress conditions with detailed molecular profiles. Robust molecular signatures that uniquely characterize early stages of malignant transformation will be developed using mathematical, statistical, and machine learning algorithms.       Fully malignant, intermediate and non-malignant breast epithelial cell cultures will be analyzed to obtain detailed molecular fingerprints. These fingerprints are processed with variable selection and discriminant analysis algorithms from which the determinant molecules for each stage of breast cancer development will be identified. To further increase the molecular detail of this approach, the cell cultures will be exposed to an oxidative stress caused by an appropriate concentration of cumene hydroperoxide, and subjected to the same data analysis workflow. The molecules identified as characteristic of each culture type, are important metabolic marker candidates for early stages of cancer development. At the same time they point to the molecular mechanisms of breast cancer origin and will increase our knowledge about the etiology of breast cancer.           ",Molecular Fingerprinting of Breast Cancer Development,7496158,R01CA120170,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Discriminant Analysis ', ' Discriminant Analyses ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecuar profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Affect ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Methods ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Collaborations ', ' Metabolic ', ' Staging ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' Condition ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' cumene hydroperoxide ', ' isopropyl benzene hydroperoxide ', ' cumylhydroperoxide ', ' cumyl hydroperoxide ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cells ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Measures ', ' Oxidants ', ' electron acceptor ', ' Oxidizing Agents ', ' response ', ' functional genomics ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' ']",NCI,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2008,327183,0.30515995441143884
"Early Detection of Breast Cancer Using Autoantibody Mar*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  When cancer is identified at the earliest stages, the probability of cure is very high and therefore diagnostic screening tests that can detect these early stages are crucial.  Efforts toward the development of early detection assays for cancers have traditionally depended on single biomarker molecules.  Current technologies have been disappointing and have not resulted in diagnostic tests suitable for clinical practice.  The core technology of this project rests on research from the PI's lab in which he has developed a high throughput method to identify large numbers of epitopes that can be used to identify the presence of breast cancer by detecting the presence of auto-antibodies to tumor proteins in the serum of the test subject.  These biomarkers are cloned without a preconceived notion of their function and can be used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.  The essential features of the approach are acknowledging the heterogeneous nature of any specific kind of cancer, departing from the reliance on any single marker for disease detection, and using specialized bioinformatics techniques to interpret the results.  The concept employs pattern recognition of multiple markers as a diagnostic rather than any single marker.  This study is possible due to a remarkable specimen bank consisting of primary breast tumor tissues and sera collected frozen at the time of surgery from 1306 patients from Detroit metropolitan hospitals from 1975 to 1983.  In addition, follow-up sera were collected from participating patients through 1992.  Interview follow-ups were continued until 1996 and data forms from patient follow-ups are available.  Over 11,000 sera have been maintained at -70¿ C at the KCI facility and are still currently available for all primary samples.  In the discovery phase, the serum antibodies have been detected by screening of large numbers of potential epitope targets on protein microarrays.  By a unique combination of techniques to enhance detection (microarrays of bacteriophage-bearing displayed tumor antigens), this study proposes to investigate a novel serum assay to detect and predict outcomes for breast cancer.  The principle is that we can clone epitopes reacting with IgG in patients sera and use them to detect antibodies in sera to discriminate cancer and healthy subjects and detect disease prior to standard diagnosis.  Such an approach should provide an early detection assay for asymptomatic women.           ",Early Detection of Breast Cancer Using Autoantibody Mar*,7681241,U01CA117478,"['Protein Microchips ', ' Protein Microarray ', ' Protein Chips ', ' Protein Biochips ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' antigen binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Institution ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Disease Marker ', ' Early Detection Research Network ', ' National Detection Research Network ', ' EDRN ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Subgroup ', ' Antigen Targeting ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Phage Display ', ' Validation ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Preparation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Foundations ', ' Freezing ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Phase ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' IgG ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' prognostic ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Libraries ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Planet Mars ', ' Mars ', ' Funding ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' Reliance ', ' Patients ', ' Antibodies ', ' Epitopes ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Printing ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Probability ', ' Staging ', ' Differentiation Antigens ', ' Marker Antigens ', ' Differentiation Markers ', ' Differentation Markers ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Nature ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Study of serum ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Tumor Antigens ', ' tumor-specific antigen ', ' Tumor-Associated Antigen ', ' Woman ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' Bacteriophages ', ' bacterial virus ', ' Phages ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' cohort ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Breast Diseases ', ' mammary disorder ', ' Breast Disorder ', ' Complementary DNA ', ' cDNA ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cloning ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' Communities ', ' Outcome ', ' tumor ', ' biomarker ', ' clinical practice ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Felis catus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Peptide Sequence Determination ', ' Protein Sequencing Molecular Biology ', ' Protein Sequencing ', ' Protein Sequence Determinations ', ' Amino Acid Sequence Determinations ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Sampling ', ' ']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2009,913996,0.16276338669886628
"A computer model to improve breast cancer diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests K07 support for Dr. Elizabeth Burnside to become an independent investigator and leader in the use of computer models to improve the early detection of breast cancer. This award will allow Dr. Burnside to optimize and validate a computer model called a Bayesian network designed to provide decision-support for radiologists interpreting mammography. This project is a multidisciplinary effort integrating computer science, applied medical informatics, population health science and breast imaging. The University of Wisconsin is an ideal environment for this work because it provides access to renowned researchers in these areas and individuals experienced with the inclusion of diverse populations in women's health research. To achieve these research and career goals, the candidate will follow a career development plan that consists of 1) acquisition of advanced research competencies in artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, probability theory, Bayesian reasoning, research ethics, and clinical trial design; 2) mentorship from nationally and internationally recognized experts; and 3) innovative research in computer-aided decision support in breast cancer diagnosis. The current state of breast cancer screening reveals a wide variability of practice and a shortage of expert mammographers. Dr. Burnside's model envisions using expert knowledge to improve non- expert performance in mammography. The model complements current computer-assisted detection algorithms by contributing information to crucial post-discovery aspects of mammography: interpretation and decision-making. Using probability theory, the model defines relationships between a patient's demographic risk factors, her mammographic findings, and diseases of the breast to generate a breast cancer risk assessment uniquely tailored to her. If successful, the model will improve the accuracy of decision-making, decrease the human costs of underperformance and variability, and deliver personalized medicine to patients who undergo mammography.

"Breast Cancer Risk Stratification with Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although risk for developing breast cancer at an earlier age is low in a substantial fraction of person-years lost it is attributed to women under the age of 40 who die from this disease. Unfortunately, screening mammography, the ""gold standard"" and accepted practice over the age of 40 for breast cancer detection, performs poorly in younger women and combined with radiation risk and expected low yield resulted in the recommendation that annual screening in the general population is not recommended below this age. Alternative imaging modalities exist (e.g. MRI, US), however, these techniques are not being used for this purpose for a variety of reasons. It would greatly facilitate breast cancer detection in younger women if an inexpensive, easy to use, widely available technology was available to pre-screen women and determine who would most likely benefit from more comprehensive imaging based studies. Currently, the only generally used screening tool in young women is Clinical Breast Exam (CBE). However, CBE has low sensitivity, high false- positive rate and is examiner dependent. Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a promising technology for fulfilling a pre-screening risk identification role as it relies on relatively inexpensive equipment that could be widely disseminated to practitioners' offices and it has demonstrated some effectiveness in detecting breast cancer regardless of age or breast density. Unfortunately, EIS technologies have demonstrated a relatively low sensitivity (~ 25 - 35%) when a high specificity (>90%) is required. Recently a new approach to EIS measurements has been developed and used quite successfully in non-medical applications. This new approach measures shifts in impedance near the resonant frequency when tissue is made a part of an RLC electric circuit. We refer to this new approach as Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS). The sensitivity of EIS near the resonant frequency is extremely high and we believe that using this approach (REIS) a much greater diagnostic performance can be achieved than was previously obtainable with EIS. In the R21 phase of this study we will build a prototype REIS device for rapidly evaluating (less than 10 minues) the breast and demonstrate feasibility for pre-screening women with the REIS device to determine who would benefit from a diagnostic imaging workup. This is not a breast cancer detection device but rather a risk stratification approach. Namely, the ultimate objective is to develop and test an approach that would segment the younger women population (< 40 years old) into two groups. One (REIS negative) that is expected to have normal risk of having breast cancer and the other (REIS positive) which identifies a group of women in which the risk of having breast cancer is substantially higher than in older women (40 - 49 years old) who are currently routinely screened. In the R33 phase a much larger patient population will be recruited and will be used to optimize the classification algorithm. Comparisons will be made with existing EIS technology. In this application we are proposing building and evaluating a device for identifying pre-menopausal women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and would thus benefit from an imaging based evaluation of the breast. This would be achieved using a low cost, safe technology that could be used during routine office visits of young women who are not screened with mammography. If successful, this proposal will have a large public health impact via increased early detection of breast cancer.          In this application we are proposing building and evaluating a device for identifying pre-menopausal women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and would thus benefit from an imaging based evaluation of the breast.

"Discovery and Clinical Validation of Cancer Biomarkers Using Printed Glycan Array    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research is dedicated to the development and clinical validation of a serum-based diagnostic test for early detection of cancer and cancer risk. We have developed a printed glycan array (PGA) that detects a robust panel of cancer-specific anti-glycan autoantibodies in sera from cancer patients and at-risk patients. Aberrant glycosylation of proteins and lipids during malignant transformation results in the appearance of specific glycan structures known as Tumor Associated Carbohydrate Antigens, or TACAs, on cell surfaces and serum components. Combinations of TACAs are always present during malignant transformation and we have already demonstrated that multiple serum autoantibodies against these TACAs can be simultaneously detected using a PGA for patients with all stages of breast cancer including individuals with premalignant diseases. Using dedicated statistical and machine learning methods, we have identified sets of autoantibodies allowing differentiation of patients with metastatic breast cancer from healthy individuals. Although preliminary, these results allow us to conclude that PGAs together with our dedicated data processing methods can be used as a tool for the discovery of glyco-biomarkers, for the development of clinical serum-based screening tests for early detection of cancer and cancer risk, and for the evaluation of malignancy status. The three key components for advancing research have been established in our labratory: (1) in-house printing of custom glycan arrays, (2) PGA-dedicated mathematical data processing tools and (3) tumor-associated glycan discovery tools. The continued research will use the printed glycan array as a major biomarker-discovery technique. Further, the combined expertise of our team of investigators including glycobiologists, oncologists, mathematicians, clinical immunologists and chemists will use PGAs in large population-based studies with the following Specific Aims: 1. To identify and validate anti-glycan autoantibody signatures of the specific stages of breast cancer disease, including: increased breast cancer risk, pre-invasive (DCIS) and early breast cancer, breast cancer progression. 2. To expand the study to the identification and validation of anti-glycan autoantibody signatures for at least three other major malignancies, including ovarian, melanoma and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). 3. To identify, isolate and/or synthesize, and perform preliminary testing of novel tumor-associated glycans in serum and cellular materials as cancer-diagnostic antigens.          ",Discovery and Clinical Validation of Cancer Biomarkers Using Printed Glycan Array,7691340,U01CA128526,"['computerized data processing ', ' signal processing ', ' data processing ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Cancer Diagnostics ', ' Premalignant ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Custom ', ' Immunologist ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Housing ', ' Ovarian ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Laboratories ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Lipids ', ' melanoma ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Oncologist ', ' Patients ', ' Polysaccharides ', ' Glycans ', ' Printing ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Staging ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate ', ' Epitectin ', ' Carcinoma-Associated Antigen ', ' Cancer-Associated Carbohydrate Antigens ', ' CA(Oxford) Antigen ', ' CA Antigens ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Protein Glycosylation ', ' Testing ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' Techniques ', ' cancer risk ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell surface ', ' Appearance ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Breast Cancer Genetics ', ' tumor ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' ']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2009,422836,0.31185957696776617
"Machine Learning for Improved Mammography Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurate breast cancer screening demands that radiologists maintain a balance of high sensitivity and high specificity when interpreting mammography. Subspecialty-trained breast imagers perform significantly better than general radiologists by recognizing more breast cancers and minimizing benign biopsies. An automated reasoning system called a Bayesian network (BN), has the potential to improve the performance of general radiologists, who interpret the majority of mammograms, to the level of subspecialty-trained breast radiologists, who are in short supply. A BN is a probabilistic graphical model that has been used for decision support in a variety of domains, including radiology. Machine learning provides an appealing way to create and optimize BNs to perform at high levels of sensitivity and specificity. Our research group has developed a prototype, expert-defined BN that uses imaging features and demographic risk factors to classify abnormalities on mammograms as benign or malignant. Our BN can perform at a higher level than general radiologists, but our goal is for it to perform as well or better than subspecialty-trained breast radiologists. To this end, we have compiled a structured, multi-relational dataset of mammography abnormalities and pathologic outcomes from which cutting edge machine learning techniques can construct an improved BN. In the past, BNs were trained and tested on individual abnormalities in isolation. In fact, other abnormalities on the same mammogram or previous mammograms, which necessarily appear in other rows of a relational database, can further improve BN learning. We have used basic statistical relational learning (SRL) techniques to enhance Bayesian learning algorithms to leverage this important additional data. A novel SRL capability introduced by our team within the last year, called view learning, makes it possible to incorporate this related data from other parts of the database by automatically defining new database fields. In our preliminary work, we have shown a stepwise improvement in BN performance: first, with conventional BN learning; then, with basic SRL; and finally, with view learning. We now seek support to determine whether more tightly integrated SRL and view learning will significantly improve our BN's ability to accurately diagnose breast cancer. In addition, we propose to investigate whether two other promising machine learning techniques, predicate-invention and collective-classification, can optimize the BN to perform at levels significantly better than current clinical practice.

"Molecular Fingerprinting of Breast Cancer Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Metabolomics is the study of cells by measuring profiles of all, or a large number, of their metabolites. Metabolomics was originally proposed as a method of functional genomics but its utility extends well beyond that - it is useful whenever an assessment of changes in metabolite levels is important. Metabolomics as a global approach is especially useful in identifying overall metabolic changes associated with breast cancer development and to identify most affected metabolites and metabolic networks.       In this project the progression of malignancy of breast epithelial cells will be characterized under normal as well as oxidative stress conditions with detailed molecular profiles. Robust molecular signatures that uniquely characterize early stages of malignant transformation will be developed using mathematical, statistical, and machine learning algorithms.       Fully malignant, intermediate and non-malignant breast epithelial cell cultures will be analyzed to obtain detailed molecular fingerprints. These fingerprints are processed with variable selection and discriminant analysis algorithms from which the determinant molecules for each stage of breast cancer development will be identified. To further increase the molecular detail of this approach, the cell cultures will be exposed to an oxidative stress caused by an appropriate concentration of cumene hydroperoxide, and subjected to the same data analysis workflow. The molecules identified as characteristic of each culture type, are important metabolic marker candidates for early stages of cancer development. At the same time they point to the molecular mechanisms of breast cancer origin and will increase our knowledge about the etiology of breast cancer.           ",Molecular Fingerprinting of Breast Cancer Development,7673595,R01CA120170,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Discriminant Analysis ', ' Discriminant Analyses ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' metabolomics ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecuar profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Affect ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Methods ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Collaborations ', ' Metabolic ', ' Staging ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' cumene hydroperoxide ', ' isopropyl benzene hydroperoxide ', ' cumylhydroperoxide ', ' cumyl hydroperoxide ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cells ', ' Measures ', ' Oxidants ', ' electron acceptor ', ' Oxidizing Agents ', ' response ', ' functional genomics ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' ']",NCI,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2009,336416,0.30515995441143884
"""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The availability of high-dimensional single-nucleotide (SNP) data for large samples of individuals with and without disease presents unprecedented opportunities for genetic epidemiologists, but also many statistical challenges. Our ability to bring these opportunities to fruition depends on the development and application of sound and innovative statistical methods. Areas of particularly great need include methods for dealing with multiple hypothesis-testing problems (multiple comparison issues), and methods for combining data from multiple sources to achieve sharper inferences (data synthesis issues). The goals of this research are to develop new or improved methods for addressing these issues, and to apply them to data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate. To accomplish these goals, the investigators will build on more than 15 years of previous work. Specifically, in 1988 the National Cancer Institute (NCI) awarded an Outstanding Investigator Grant (OIG) to the Principle Investigator for the development and application of new and improved statistical methods for use in epidemiological research. In 1995 this grant was renewed until NCI terminated the program in 2001. The research was then funded by R01 CA94069 for the period January 2002 to December 2006. This competing renewal application requests funds to continue this work and to apply it to new areas of emerging importance. The specific aims are fourfold: 1) to evaluate new and existing methods for controlling confounding and tail count variability in case-control genome-wide association (GWA) studies; 2) to evaluate risks associated with missense mutations of unknown significance in genes of established disease relevance; 3) to combine multiple independent sources of data in assessing the joint carcinogenic effects of groups of genes; and 4) to integrate data on tumor and patient characteristics for improved assessment of phenotype-specific etiology. We will evaluate the new methods by simulations, and we will illustrate them by application to existing data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate, and emerging data from GWA studies of breast and prostate cancer. The existing data have been collected either by the investigators and the consultants to this project, or as part of three collaborations in which the investigators participate: the Breast Cancer Family Registry (Breast-CFR), the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC), and the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG). In summary, we need sound, reliable methods for analyzing the vast amounts of emerging genetic data from individuals with and without a given type of cancer. The goals of this research are to develop such methods, and thereby to help generate new knowledge useful for cancer prevention and treatment.                                         ","""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""",7670458,R01CA094069,"['tumor ', ' Computer Programs and Programming ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' breast cancer family registry ', ' Critiques ', ' Data Sources ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' International ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Stratification ', ' Study Section ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Output ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' acronyms ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Incidence ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Funding ', ' Methods ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Ovary ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' tool ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' BRCA1 gene ', ' brca 1 gene ', ' RNF53 ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 1 Gene ', ' BRCA1 ', ' programs ', ' sound ', ' Suggestion ', ' Tail ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Award ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Penetrance ', ' BRCA2 gene ', ' brca 2 gene ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 2 ', ' FANCD1 ', ' FANCB ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 2 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 2 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 2 Gene ', ' BRCA2 ', ' Missense Mutation ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' simulation ', ' Glossary ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' cancer genetics ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' conditioning ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' user-friendly ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,573074,0.10557800921911441
"Using Markov Decision Processes to Optimize Breast Biopsy Decision Making DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary Early diagnosis through screening mammography is the most effective means of decreasing the death rate from breast cancer. While mammography is inexpensive, the interventional procedures that result from detected abnormalities (both false and true positives) increase the cost of this population-based screening program significantly. In fact, breast biopsy actually delivers a benign result in over 80% of cases making it the most costly per capita component of a breast cancer screening program. If a mammogram reports a suspicious finding, then a biopsy is required to decide whether an abnormality is in fact a breast cancer. A false positive mammogram exposes the patient to the anxiety, pain, and possible complications while the health care system bears the cost of potentially unnecessary biopsies. Our previous research has developed a probabilistic computer model called the Mammography Bayesian Network (MBN) that calculates the risk of breast disease based on demographic risk factors and mammography findings. The objective of this research is to optimize the biopsy decisions for breast-cancer patients such that the early diagnosis of invasive breast cancer is improved while unnecessary invasive procedures are minimized. We will calibrate our previously developed MBN, to accurately calculate the risk of breast cancer based on demographic risk factors and mammography findings. We will use Markov decision processes, an advanced decision analysis technique that is used for decision- making under uncertainty, to find the optimal probability thresholds for the decision to perform breast biopsy for patients with different age groups. We will determine whether these optimal probability thresholds change with patient age.  Relevance of this research to Public Health: The proposed research will improve the interpretation of screening mammography, the most effective means of decreasing the death rate from breast cancer, which affects millions of women in the US. Any improvement in screening mammography will reduce the costs of unnecessary biopsies to the society.

"Optimization of PET Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality that is capable of imaging biochemical processes in humans or animals through the use of radioactive tracers. PET/CT with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is increasingly being used for staging, restaging and treatment monitoring for cancer patients with different types of tumors. However, current FDG-PET provides a low sensitivity to detect micrometastases and small tumor infiltrated lymph nodes. The goal of this project is to improve the efficacy of PET imaging through the development of novel image reconstruction methods and data analysis tools. During the current funding period, we have developed a method for tuning reconstruction algorithm based on the noise characteristics in measured patient data. This patient-adaptive reconstruction algorithm has been validated using computer simulations and phantom experiments. In the next phase of the project, we will implement the patient-adaptive algorithm on clinical PET scanners and validate the method using patient data. We will further expand the capability of PET imaging by developing novel methods to utilize the anatomical information provided by PET/CT scanners and by exploring the potential of dynamic PET for cancer detection and staging. The four specific aims of the project are (1) To implement the patient-adaptive MAP reconstruction on clinical scanners and to validate the algorithm using breast cancer patients; (2) To develop a novel approach to PET image reconstruction using anatomical information; (3) To develop statistically efficient image reconstruction methods for dynamic PET; (4) To identify spatial-temporal features in dynamic PET image for detection and characterization of breast cancer and to evaluate the performance using breast cancer patient data. The first aim is an important step towards translating image reconstruction technology development into patient health care. Once validated using breast cancer patients, the method is readily applicable to imaging other types of tumors. The second to the fourth aims will greatly enhance the capability of PET by taking advantage of the recent advances in instrumentation (wide availability of PET/CT) and the dynamic nature of PET imaging. We expect the new methods to be developed will be able to extract clinically relevant features from dynamic PET for detecting small tumors and characterizing the malignancy of primary tumors. All the results will be validated using breast cancer patient data with histologically verified ground truth. The success of this research will have a significant and positive impact on the management of patients with breast cancer.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique that can detect cancer and monitor treatment response.

"Network-based Prediction of Antiestrogen Resistance in Breast Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2008, over 41,000 American women will die of breast cancer. In the same period, there will be almost 173,000 newly diagnosed cases of invasive breast cancer, approximately 70% of which will be estrogen receptor-1 positive (ER+). However, it is evident that we still do not fully understand either the nature of ER-driven molecular signaling or how this differs in endocrine sensitive and resistant breast tumors. In this project, we hypothesize that new insights into ER1-signaling can be discovered in the context of hormone responsiveness. We will develop, optimize, and apply innovative new computational methods to breast cancer gene expression microarray data sets. We will discover new knowledge of ER signaling and construct, test, and validate computational models of antiestrogen (AE) resistance. We also hypothesize that model predictions will have clinical/functional relevance and will identify new targets for drug development. Specific aims of this application include: (1) to develop new computational methods, integrative network analyses (INA), and use these to build and test computational models of ER1 signaling in the context of hormone responsiveness; (2) to develop a network motif-based prediction (NMP) scheme to integrate network information and gene expression profiles to identify signaling components of ER-mediated signaling associated with AE resistance; (3) to assess and validate the functional relevance of key genes in mechanistic studies in breast cancer models, and ultimately use this information to identify new therapeutic targets for drug discovery. The development of new therapies for endocrine resistant disease should have a major impact on breast cancer mortality and improve quality of life for breast cancer survivors. The proposed project will be carried out by an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, molecular biologists, and medical oncologists at Virginia Tech and Georgetown University Medical Center, and represents a continuation of the long and productive collaboration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While antiestrogen (AE) therapies induce a high proportion of objective responses and will have a significant survival benefit for some women, many of these cancers will recur due to AE resistance.

"Machine Learning for Improved Mammography Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurate breast cancer screening demands that radiologists maintain a balance of high sensitivity and high specificity when interpreting mammography. Subspecialty-trained breast imagers perform significantly better than general radiologists by recognizing more breast cancers and minimizing benign biopsies. An automated reasoning system called a Bayesian network (BN), has the potential to improve the performance of general radiologists, who interpret the majority of mammograms, to the level of subspecialty-trained breast radiologists, who are in short supply. A BN is a probabilistic graphical model that has been used for decision support in a variety of domains, including radiology. Machine learning provides an appealing way to create and optimize BNs to perform at high levels of sensitivity and specificity. Our research group has developed a prototype, expert-defined BN that uses imaging features and demographic risk factors to classify abnormalities on mammograms as benign or malignant. Our BN can perform at a higher level than general radiologists, but our goal is for it to perform as well or better than subspecialty-trained breast radiologists. To this end, we have compiled a structured, multi-relational dataset of mammography abnormalities and pathologic outcomes from which cutting edge machine learning techniques can construct an improved BN. In the past, BNs were trained and tested on individual abnormalities in isolation. In fact, other abnormalities on the same mammogram or previous mammograms, which necessarily appear in other rows of a relational database, can further improve BN learning. We have used basic statistical relational learning (SRL) techniques to enhance Bayesian learning algorithms to leverage this important additional data. A novel SRL capability introduced by our team within the last year, called view learning, makes it possible to incorporate this related data from other parts of the database by automatically defining new database fields. In our preliminary work, we have shown a stepwise improvement in BN performance: first, with conventional BN learning; then, with basic SRL; and finally, with view learning. We now seek support to determine whether more tightly integrated SRL and view learning will significantly improve our BN's ability to accurately diagnose breast cancer. In addition, we propose to investigate whether two other promising machine learning techniques, predicate-invention and collective-classification, can optimize the BN to perform at levels significantly better than current clinical practice.           ",Machine Learning for Improved Mammography Screening,7776970,R01CA127379,"['Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Address ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Pathologic ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' Derivation ', ' Text ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Foundations ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' image processing ', ' Goals ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' acronyms ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Link ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' radiologist ', ' RDST ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Exposure to ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Reading ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Specificity ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mtb infection [{C0041296}] ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' Biopsy ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' computer science ', ' Boxing ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Gur ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Glossary ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Multiple Abnormalities ', ' Modeling ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Accounting ', ' Communication ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' cost ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' Outcome ', ' prototype ', ' clinical practice ', ' relational database ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2010,277409,0.27502076083879823
"""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The availability of high-dimensional single-nucleotide (SNP) data for large samples of individuals with and without disease presents unprecedented opportunities for genetic epidemiologists, but also many statistical challenges. Our ability to bring these opportunities to fruition depends on the development and application of sound and innovative statistical methods. Areas of particularly great need include methods for dealing with multiple hypothesis-testing problems (multiple comparison issues), and methods for combining data from multiple sources to achieve sharper inferences (data synthesis issues). The goals of this research are to develop new or improved methods for addressing these issues, and to apply them to data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate. To accomplish these goals, the investigators will build on more than 15 years of previous work. Specifically, in 1988 the National Cancer Institute (NCI) awarded an Outstanding Investigator Grant (OIG) to the Principle Investigator for the development and application of new and improved statistical methods for use in epidemiological research. In 1995 this grant was renewed until NCI terminated the program in 2001. The research was then funded by R01 CA94069 for the period January 2002 to December 2006. This competing renewal application requests funds to continue this work and to apply it to new areas of emerging importance. The specific aims are fourfold: 1) to evaluate new and existing methods for controlling confounding and tail count variability in case-control genome-wide association (GWA) studies; 2) to evaluate risks associated with missense mutations of unknown significance in genes of established disease relevance; 3) to combine multiple independent sources of data in assessing the joint carcinogenic effects of groups of genes; and 4) to integrate data on tumor and patient characteristics for improved assessment of phenotype-specific etiology. We will evaluate the new methods by simulations, and we will illustrate them by application to existing data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate, and emerging data from GWA studies of breast and prostate cancer. The existing data have been collected either by the investigators and the consultants to this project, or as part of three collaborations in which the investigators participate: the Breast Cancer Family Registry (Breast-CFR), the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC), and the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG). In summary, we need sound, reliable methods for analyzing the vast amounts of emerging genetic data from individuals with and without a given type of cancer. The goals of this research are to develop such methods, and thereby to help generate new knowledge useful for cancer prevention and treatment.                                         ","""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""",7936896,R01CA094069,"['breast cancer family registry ', ' Critiques ', ' Data Sources ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' International ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Stratification ', ' Study Section ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Output ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' acronyms ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Incidence ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Funding ', ' Methods ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Ovary ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' tool ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' BRCA1 gene ', ' brca 1 gene ', ' RNF53 ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 1 Gene ', ' BRCA1 ', ' programs ', ' sound ', ' Suggestion ', ' Tail ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Award ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Penetrance ', ' BRCA2 gene ', ' brca 2 gene ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 2 ', ' FANCD1 ', ' FANCB ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 2 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 2 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 2 Gene ', ' BRCA2 ', ' Missense Mutation ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' simulation ', ' Glossary ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' cancer genetics ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' case control ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' conditioning ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' user-friendly ', ' tumor ', ' Computer Programs and Programming ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,580133,0.10557800921911441
"Network-based Prediction of Antiestrogen Resistance in Breast Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2008, over 41,000 American women will die of breast cancer. In the same period, there will be almost 173,000 newly diagnosed cases of invasive breast cancer, approximately 70% of which will be estrogen receptor-1 positive (ER+). However, it is evident that we still do not fully understand either the nature of ER-driven molecular signaling or how this differs in endocrine sensitive and resistant breast tumors. In this project, we hypothesize that new insights into ER1-signaling can be discovered in the context of hormone responsiveness. We will develop, optimize, and apply innovative new computational methods to breast cancer gene expression microarray data sets. We will discover new knowledge of ER signaling and construct, test, and validate computational models of antiestrogen (AE) resistance. We also hypothesize that model predictions will have clinical/functional relevance and will identify new targets for drug development. Specific aims of this application include: (1) to develop new computational methods, integrative network analyses (INA), and use these to build and test computational models of ER1 signaling in the context of hormone responsiveness; (2) to develop a network motif-based prediction (NMP) scheme to integrate network information and gene expression profiles to identify signaling components of ER-mediated signaling associated with AE resistance; (3) to assess and validate the functional relevance of key genes in mechanistic studies in breast cancer models, and ultimately use this information to identify new therapeutic targets for drug discovery. The development of new therapies for endocrine resistant disease should have a major impact on breast cancer mortality and improve quality of life for breast cancer survivors. The proposed project will be carried out by an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, molecular biologists, and medical oncologists at Virginia Tech and Georgetown University Medical Center, and represents a continuation of the long and productive collaboration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While antiestrogen (AE) therapies induce a high proportion of objective responses and will have a significant survival benefit for some women, many of these cancers will recur due to AE resistance. In this project, we will develop, optimize, and apply innovative new computational methods to breast cancer gene expression microarray data sets for AE resistance prediction. We will discover new knowledge of ER signaling and construct, test, and validate computational models of AE resistance, and ultimately use this information to identify new therapeutic targets for drug discovery.           Project Narrative: While antiestrogen (AE) therapies induce a high proportion of objective responses and will have a significant survival benefit for some women, many of these cancers will recur due to AE resistance.

"A computer model to improve breast cancer diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests K07 support for Dr. Elizabeth Burnside to become an independent investigator and leader in the use of computer models to improve the early detection of breast cancer. This award will allow Dr. Burnside to optimize and validate a computer model called a Bayesian network designed to provide decision-support for radiologists interpreting mammography. This project is a multidisciplinary effort integrating computer science, applied medical informatics, population health science and breast imaging. The University of Wisconsin is an ideal environment for this work because it provides access to renowned researchers in these areas and individuals experienced with the inclusion of diverse populations in women's health research. To achieve these research and career goals, the candidate will follow a career development plan that consists of 1) acquisition of advanced research competencies in artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, probability theory, Bayesian reasoning, research ethics, and clinical trial design; 2) mentorship from nationally and internationally recognized experts; and 3) innovative research in computer-aided decision support in breast cancer diagnosis. The current state of breast cancer screening reveals a wide variability of practice and a shortage of expert mammographers. Dr. Burnside's model envisions using expert knowledge to improve non- expert performance in mammography. The model complements current computer-assisted detection algorithms by contributing information to crucial post-discovery aspects of mammography: interpretation and decision-making. Using probability theory, the model defines relationships between a patient's demographic risk factors, her mammographic findings, and diseases of the breast to generate a breast cancer risk assessment uniquely tailored to her. If successful, the model will improve the accuracy of decision-making, decrease the human costs of underperformance and variability, and deliver personalized medicine to patients who undergo mammography.

"Breast Cancer Risk Stratification with Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although risk for developing breast cancer at an earlier age is low in a substantial fraction of person-years lost it is attributed to women under the age of 40 who die from this disease. Unfortunately, screening mammography, the ""gold standard"" and accepted practice over the age of 40 for breast cancer detection, performs poorly in younger women and combined with radiation risk and expected low yield resulted in the recommendation that annual screening in the general population is not recommended below this age. Alternative imaging modalities exist (e.g. MRI, US), however, these techniques are not being used for this purpose for a variety of reasons. It would greatly facilitate breast cancer detection in younger women if an inexpensive, easy to use, widely available technology was available to pre-screen women and determine who would most likely benefit from more comprehensive imaging based studies. Currently, the only generally used screening tool in young women is Clinical Breast Exam (CBE). However, CBE has low sensitivity, high false- positive rate and is examiner dependent. Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a promising technology for fulfilling a pre-screening risk identification role as it relies on relatively inexpensive equipment that could be widely disseminated to practitioners' offices and it has demonstrated some effectiveness in detecting breast cancer regardless of age or breast density. Unfortunately, EIS technologies have demonstrated a relatively low sensitivity (~ 25 - 35%) when a high specificity (>90%) is required. Recently a new approach to EIS measurements has been developed and used quite successfully in non-medical applications. This new approach measures shifts in impedance near the resonant frequency when tissue is made a part of an RLC electric circuit. We refer to this new approach as Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS). The sensitivity of EIS near the resonant frequency is extremely high and we believe that using this approach (REIS) a much greater diagnostic performance can be achieved than was previously obtainable with EIS. In the R21 phase of this study we will build a prototype REIS device for rapidly evaluating (less than 10 minues) the breast and demonstrate feasibility for pre-screening women with the REIS device to determine who would benefit from a diagnostic imaging workup. This is not a breast cancer detection device but rather a risk stratification approach. Namely, the ultimate objective is to develop and test an approach that would segment the younger women population (< 40 years old) into two groups. One (REIS negative) that is expected to have normal risk of having breast cancer and the other (REIS positive) which identifies a group of women in which the risk of having breast cancer is substantially higher than in older women (40 - 49 years old) who are currently routinely screened. In the R33 phase a much larger patient population will be recruited and will be used to optimize the classification algorithm. Comparisons will be made with existing EIS technology. In this application we are proposing building and evaluating a device for identifying pre-menopausal women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and would thus benefit from an imaging based evaluation of the breast. This would be achieved using a low cost, safe technology that could be used during routine office visits of young women who are not screened with mammography. If successful, this proposal will have a large public health impact via increased early detection of breast cancer.          ",Breast Cancer Risk Stratification with Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy,7804524,R33CA127169,"['Skin ', ' Diagnostic Imaging ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Equipment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Subgroup ', ' in vivo ', ' Genetic Programming ', ' Genetic Algorithm ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Modification ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' electric impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' breast density ', ' Foundations ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Gold ', ' Au element ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Premenopause ', ' pre-menopausal ', ' Premenopausal Period ', ' Premenopausal ', ' Pre-menopausal Period ', ' Pre-Menopause ', ' Incidence ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Persons ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' Noise ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Exposure to ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Western World ', ' Specificity ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Woman ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Palpable ', ' palpable disease ', ' Biopsy ', ' age group ', ' cancer risk ', ' Performance ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Categories ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' Measures ', ' Radiation ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' older women ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' Drops ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R33,2010,410341,0.33541818073568186
"Discovery and Clinical Validation of Cancer Biomarkers Using Printed Glycan Array    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research is dedicated to the development and clinical validation of a serum-based diagnostic test for early detection of cancer and cancer risk. We have developed a printed glycan array (PGA) that detects a robust panel of cancer-specific anti-glycan autoantibodies in sera from cancer patients and at-risk patients. Aberrant glycosylation of proteins and lipids during malignant transformation results in the appearance of specific glycan structures known as Tumor Associated Carbohydrate Antigens, or TACAs, on cell surfaces and serum components. Combinations of TACAs are always present during malignant transformation and we have already demonstrated that multiple serum autoantibodies against these TACAs can be simultaneously detected using a PGA for patients with all stages of breast cancer including individuals with premalignant diseases. Using dedicated statistical and machine learning methods, we have identified sets of autoantibodies allowing differentiation of patients with metastatic breast cancer from healthy individuals. Although preliminary, these results allow us to conclude that PGAs together with our dedicated data processing methods can be used as a tool for the discovery of glyco-biomarkers, for the development of clinical serum-based screening tests for early detection of cancer and cancer risk, and for the evaluation of malignancy status. The three key components for advancing research have been established in our labratory: (1) in-house printing of custom glycan arrays, (2) PGA-dedicated mathematical data processing tools and (3) tumor-associated glycan discovery tools. The continued research will use the printed glycan array as a major biomarker-discovery technique. Further, the combined expertise of our team of investigators including glycobiologists, oncologists, mathematicians, clinical immunologists and chemists will use PGAs in large population-based studies with the following Specific Aims: 1. To identify and validate anti-glycan autoantibody signatures of the specific stages of breast cancer disease, including: increased breast cancer risk, pre-invasive (DCIS) and early breast cancer, breast cancer progression. 2. To expand the study to the identification and validation of anti-glycan autoantibody signatures for at least three other major malignancies, including ovarian, melanoma and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). 3. To identify, isolate and/or synthesize, and perform preliminary testing of novel tumor-associated glycans in serum and cellular materials as cancer-diagnostic antigens.          ",Discovery and Clinical Validation of Cancer Biomarkers Using Printed Glycan Array,7935183,U01CA128526,"['computerized data processing ', ' signal processing ', ' data processing ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Cancer Diagnostics ', ' Premalignant ', ' precancerous ', ' Pre-Malignant ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Custom ', ' Immunologist ', ' base ', ' tumor progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Housing ', ' Ovarian ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Laboratories ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Lipids ', ' melanoma ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Oncologist ', ' Patients ', ' Polysaccharides ', ' Glycans ', ' Printing ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Staging ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate ', ' Epitectin ', ' Carcinoma-Associated Antigen ', ' Cancer-Associated Carbohydrate Antigens ', ' CA(Oxford) Antigen ', ' CA Antigens ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Protein Glycosylation ', ' Testing ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' Techniques ', ' cancer risk ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell surface ', ' Appearance ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Breast Cancer Genetics ', ' tumor ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' ']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2010,420331,0.31185957696776617
"Optimization of PET Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality that is capable of imaging biochemical processes in humans or animals through the use of radioactive tracers. PET/CT with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is increasingly being used for staging, restaging and treatment monitoring for cancer patients with different types of tumors. However, current FDG-PET provides a low sensitivity to detect micrometastases and small tumor infiltrated lymph nodes. The goal of this project is to improve the efficacy of PET imaging through the development of novel image reconstruction methods and data analysis tools. During the current funding period, we have developed a method for tuning reconstruction algorithm based on the noise characteristics in measured patient data. This patient-adaptive reconstruction algorithm has been validated using computer simulations and phantom experiments. In the next phase of the project, we will implement the patient-adaptive algorithm on clinical PET scanners and validate the method using patient data. We will further expand the capability of PET imaging by developing novel methods to utilize the anatomical information provided by PET/CT scanners and by exploring the potential of dynamic PET for cancer detection and staging. The four specific aims of the project are (1) To implement the patient-adaptive MAP reconstruction on clinical scanners and to validate the algorithm using breast cancer patients; (2) To develop a novel approach to PET image reconstruction using anatomical information; (3) To develop statistically efficient image reconstruction methods for dynamic PET; (4) To identify spatial-temporal features in dynamic PET image for detection and characterization of breast cancer and to evaluate the performance using breast cancer patient data. The first aim is an important step towards translating image reconstruction technology development into patient health care. Once validated using breast cancer patients, the method is readily applicable to imaging other types of tumors. The second to the fourth aims will greatly enhance the capability of PET by taking advantage of the recent advances in instrumentation (wide availability of PET/CT) and the dynamic nature of PET imaging. We expect the new methods to be developed will be able to extract clinically relevant features from dynamic PET for detecting small tumors and characterizing the malignancy of primary tumors. All the results will be validated using breast cancer patient data with histologically verified ground truth. The success of this research will have a significant and positive impact on the management of patients with breast cancer.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique that can detect cancer and monitor treatment response.

"Decision Support System for Predicting outcome of ER+ breast cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose an alternative, inexpensive means for identifying the subset of women with ER+ breast cancer for whom hormonal therapy alone is sufficient, and adjuvant chemotherapy is not required. Our novel approach uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to extract information from digitized histological sections of breast tissue (e.g. graphical and morphological arrangement of nuclei, lymphocytes, textural appearance, and tubule density), yielding a continuous image-based risk score (IbRiS) from zero to one that predicts the risk of recurrence. By choosing the appropriate cutoff value, IbRiS can be used to stratify ER+ patients into two classes: low and high risk. A low risk identifies those women who would respond well to hormonal therapy alone.  Of the 120,000 women annually diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer in the US, the vast majority will be considered at high risk of having distant recurrence (metastasis) within 10 years. Under current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, these women will be advised to receive adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to standard hormonal treatment (e.g. tamoxifen). However, 85% of these women will not benefit from chemotherapy, and yet will still incur its deleterious side-effects.  The only non-investigational tool to help better determine which women should receive tamoxifen alone is the Oncotype Dx molecular assay, which is now widely used by medical oncologists. Oncotype Dx is able to correctly reclassify (as low-risk) 50% of those women with ER+ cancers that have been classified as high-risk (or intermediate-risk) by the NCCN guidelines, obviating their need for chemotherapy. However, Oncotype Dx is inaccessible to the majority of women in the US (and worldwide) because of its high cost ($4500), and requirement that the tissue samples be sent to specialized remote facilities. Consequently, there is clearly a market need for a lower-priced assay capable of reaching a wider audience.  The specific aims of this proposal are as follows: 1) develop an image-based risk score (IbRiS) for predicting the subset of women with ER+ breast cancer that wil respond wel without chemotherapy and 2) evaluate IbRiS performance in predicting recurrence over an independent set of ER+ breast cancers treated with tamoxifen alone. IbRiS has several key advantages over molecular assays. First, it requires no disruption of the current clinical protocol since the necessary tissue samples are already collected during routine pathological examinations. Second, IbRiS has a zero cost-of-goods sold, and thus could serve as either a lower-priced alternative to a molecular assay or as a quantitative triage, determining which patients should be administered the more expensive molecular test. Finally, since IbRiS only requires a digital slide scanner (i.e. no specialized facility is necessary), its footprint could extend worldwide (via the internet).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year tens of thousands of women in the US with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer are treated with chemotherapy, though only a few thousand will benefit from it. In this proposal we will develop an image-based risk score (IbRiS) to predict which women with ER+ breast cancer do not require chemotherapy. This test will provide an economical alternative to the far more expensive gene-expression based assays currently in use.           Every year tens of thousands of women in the US with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer are treated with chemotherapy, though only a few thousand will benefit from it.

"Bayesian Rule Learning Methods for Disease Prediction and Biomarker Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The problem: High-throughput biomedical data from biomarker profiling studies aimed at early detection of diseases like lung cancer are accumulating rapidly. Although many popular machine learning methods have been utilized for analysis of such high-dimensional datasets, no single method has consistently outperformed others. Moreover, scientists have the need to simultaneously address two related tasks: disease prediction and biomarker discovery, using the same sets of data and tools. One way, as undertaken in this project, to address this need is to find the most accurate classifier for the disease from a given set of profiles and present the discriminative markers used in that model to the scientist for further verification. The large space of possible models coupled with the small sample size of the data make it hard to accurately estimate predictive accuracy.       The solution: This project will develop, evaluate and refine novel Bayesian Rule Learning (BRL) methods that are algorithmically efficient, result in parsimonious models and accurately estimate predictive uncertainty from sparse biomedical datasets. BRL methods utilize a Bayesian score to evaluate rule models, thereby quantifying the uncertainty in the validity of the rule itself. This novel technique that combines the mathematical rigor of Bayesian network learning with rule-based modeling opens up a hitherto underexplored area of fundamental research in informatics involving such hybrid methodologies. Rules enable modular representation of knowledge and collaboration with scientists, as it is easier to present the model and extract markers both visually and computationally. Rule-based inference is also simpler and more tractable. The Bayesian approach enables prior knowledge to be incorporated and evaluated in a continual fashion with a human in the loop. The latter is very important for refinement of both tools and models.       The specific aims: This project will test the hypothesis that the BRL methods developed and extended herein produce more accurate and parsimonious models for disease state prediction than other state-of-the-art machine learning methods. This project evaluates BRL methods and models using existing proteomic datasets for three diverse diseases - rare, neurodegenerative Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and the two most common cancers in the world, lung and breast cancers. Experimental verification will be performed using a new set of retrospectively collected breast cancer sera samples to evaluate model generalizability.       The significance: This project will produce: (1) a novel biomedical data mining tool for analyzing data from biomarker profiling studies of any disease, (2) methodological insights into the applicability of this tool and current machine learning methods for such tasks, and (3) new data for research on the early detection of breast cancer. It has potential to help develop new diagnostic tests for early detection of ALS, lung and breast cancers and lays a firm foundation for building modeling frameworks that can incorporate both prior knowledge and data to provide the technological capability for combining evidence from multiple, heterogeneous sources.           This project will develop highly-needed data mining methods for analyzing the spate of datasets  arising from high-throughput technologies for molecular biomarker profiling. It will generate  new experimental data for early detection of breast cancer, and has the potential to help create  new diagnostic screening tools for three diverse diseases: two of the most common cancers in  the world - lung and breast cancers, and rare, neurodegenerative Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

"Integrating Machine Learning and Physician Expertise for Breast Cancer Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop novel machine learning techniques to integrate physician expertise and machine learned, logical rules in a graphical model that will accurately estimate breast cancer risk after breast biopsy. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical and computer science literature) illustrating an innovative research program that merges cutting edge machine learning algorithms including inductive logic programming and statistical relational learning to train graphical models to predict breast cancer risk. However, in contrast to prior work, we are testing a completely new methodology which we call Advice-Based-Learning (ABLe). By developing ABLe, our team aims to establish an innovative, collaborative cycle between machine-learning and physician expertise. We propose to test the hypothesis that this cycle will increase accuracy beyond what either the machine or human can accomplish alone. Specifically, we hypothesize first that a conventionally-trained graphical model trained with conventional machine learning first algorithms can accurately predict the risk of breast cancer after core biopsy and perform better than current clinical practice; a critical aim that is favorably foreshadowed by our new preliminary data but is labor intensive because we must perfect our unique clinical data that accurately represents clinical experience. Second, a graphical model trained using ABLe can incorporate multi-relational data with physician expertise and significantly improve the predictive accuracy over conventionally trained graphical models and current clinical practice. Third, our best graphical model trained with ABLe will accurately estimate the probability of malignancy after breast biopsy on new clinical cases better than physicians alone resulting in a tool that has the potential to improve care.       Our clinical application is as compelling as our algorithmic work. Image-guided core needle biopsy of the breast is a common procedure that is imperfect, has high-stakes, and is particularly amenable to improvement with automated decision support. Breast core biopsy, the standard of care for breast cancer diagnosis, can be ""non-definitive"" in 5-15% of women undergoing this procedure. This means that between 35,000-105,000 women will require additional biopsies or radiologic follow-up to cement a diagnosis and risk the possibility of missed breast cancers, delays in diagnosis, and unnecessary surgeries. This important problem is emblematic of a plethora of clinical situations where rigorous and accurate risk estimation of rare events provides the opportunity for automated decisions support tools to personalize and strategically target health care interventions to improve decision-making for health-care providers and patients. This award will enable us not only to produce graphical models that provide improved decision support in the breast cancer clinic, but also, and more significantly, to develop a methodology that integrates heterogeneous predictive data and physician knowledge within a graphical model, thereby developing and validating a new algorithmic paradigm for creating accurate, comprehensible, adaptable decision support tools well-suited for clinical translation.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Our multidisciplinary group of breast cancer physicians and computer scientists propose to develop a new paradigm for construction of clinical decision support tools that will integrate machine learning (computers learning from data) and physician expertise in order to perform better than either alone.

"Discovery and Clinical Validation of Cancer Biomarkers Using Printed Glycan Array    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research is dedicated to the development and clinical validation of a serum-based diagnostic test for early detection of cancer and cancer risk. We have developed a printed glycan array (PGA) that detects a robust panel of cancer-specific anti-glycan autoantibodies in sera from cancer patients and at-risk patients. Aberrant glycosylation of proteins and lipids during malignant transformation results in the appearance of specific glycan structures known as Tumor Associated Carbohydrate Antigens, or TACAs, on cell surfaces and serum components. Combinations of TACAs are always present during malignant transformation and we have already demonstrated that multiple serum autoantibodies against these TACAs can be simultaneously detected using a PGA for patients with all stages of breast cancer including individuals with premalignant diseases. Using dedicated statistical and machine learning methods, we have identified sets of autoantibodies allowing differentiation of patients with metastatic breast cancer from healthy individuals. Although preliminary, these results allow us to conclude that PGAs together with our dedicated data processing methods can be used as a tool for the discovery of glyco-biomarkers, for the development of clinical serum-based screening tests for early detection of cancer and cancer risk, and for the evaluation of malignancy status. The three key components for advancing research have been established in our labratory: (1) in-house printing of custom glycan arrays, (2) PGA-dedicated mathematical data processing tools and (3) tumor-associated glycan discovery tools. The continued research will use the printed glycan array as a major biomarker-discovery technique. Further, the combined expertise of our team of investigators including glycobiologists, oncologists, mathematicians, clinical immunologists and chemists will use PGAs in large population-based studies with the following Specific Aims: 1. To identify and validate anti-glycan autoantibody signatures of the specific stages of breast cancer disease, including: increased breast cancer risk, pre-invasive (DCIS) and early breast cancer, breast cancer progression. 2. To expand the study to the identification and validation of anti-glycan autoantibody signatures for at least three other major malignancies, including ovarian, melanoma and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). 3.

"""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The availability of high-dimensional single-nucleotide (SNP) data for large samples of individuals with and without disease presents unprecedented opportunities for genetic epidemiologists, but also many statistical challenges. Our ability to bring these opportunities to fruition depends on the development and application of sound and innovative statistical methods. Areas of particularly great need include methods for dealing with multiple hypothesis-testing problems (multiple comparison issues), and methods for combining data from multiple sources to achieve sharper inferences (data synthesis issues). The goals of this research are to develop new or improved methods for addressing these issues, and to apply them to data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate. To accomplish these goals, the investigators will build on more than 15 years of previous work. Specifically, in 1988 the National Cancer Institute (NCI) awarded an Outstanding Investigator Grant (OIG) to the Principle Investigator for the development and application of new and improved statistical methods for use in epidemiological research. In 1995 this grant was renewed until NCI terminated the program in 2001. The research was then funded by R01 CA94069 for the period January 2002 to December 2006. This competing renewal application requests funds to continue this work and to apply it to new areas of emerging importance. The specific aims are fourfold: 1) to evaluate new and existing methods for controlling confounding and tail count variability in case-control genome-wide association (GWA) studies; 2) to evaluate risks associated with missense mutations of unknown significance in genes of established disease relevance; 3) to combine multiple independent sources of data in assessing the joint carcinogenic effects of groups of genes; and 4) to integrate data on tumor and patient characteristics for improved assessment of phenotype-specific etiology. We will evaluate the new methods by simulations, and we will illustrate them by application to existing data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate, and emerging data from GWA studies of breast and prostate cancer. The existing data have been collected either by the investigators and the consultants to this project, or as part of three collaborations in which the investigators participate: the Breast Cancer Family Registry (Breast-CFR), the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC), and the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG). In summary, we need sound, reliable methods for analyzing the vast amounts of emerging genetic data from individuals with and without a given type of cancer.

"Optimization of PET Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality that is capable of imaging biochemical processes in humans or animals through the use of radioactive tracers. PET/CT with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is increasingly being used for staging, restaging and treatment monitoring for cancer patients with different types of tumors. However, current FDG-PET provides a low sensitivity to detect micrometastases and small tumor infiltrated lymph nodes. The goal of this project is to improve the efficacy of PET imaging through the development of novel image reconstruction methods and data analysis tools. During the current funding period, we have developed a method for tuning reconstruction algorithm based on the noise characteristics in measured patient data. This patient-adaptive reconstruction algorithm has been validated using computer simulations and phantom experiments. In the next phase of the project, we will implement the patient-adaptive algorithm on clinical PET scanners and validate the method using patient data. We will further expand the capability of PET imaging by developing novel methods to utilize the anatomical information provided by PET/CT scanners and by exploring the potential of dynamic PET for cancer detection and staging. The four specific aims of the project are (1) To implement the patient-adaptive MAP reconstruction on clinical scanners and to validate the algorithm using breast cancer patients; (2) To develop a novel approach to PET image reconstruction using anatomical information; (3) To develop statistically efficient image reconstruction methods for dynamic PET; (4) To identify spatial-temporal features in dynamic PET image for detection and characterization of breast cancer and to evaluate the performance using breast cancer patient data. The first aim is an important step towards translating image reconstruction technology development into patient health care. Once validated using breast cancer patients, the method is readily applicable to imaging other types of tumors. The second to the fourth aims will greatly enhance the capability of PET by taking advantage of the recent advances in instrumentation (wide availability of PET/CT) and the dynamic nature of PET imaging. We expect the new methods to be developed will be able to extract clinically relevant features from dynamic PET for detecting small tumors and characterizing the malignancy of primary tumors. All the results will be validated using breast cancer patient data with histologically verified ground truth. The success of this research will have a significant and positive impact on the management of patients with breast cancer.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique that can detect cancer and monitor treatment response.

"Informatics Techniques to Optimize Mammography for Aging Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop, integrate, and evaluate novel informatics techniques to optimize the mammographic diagnosis of breast cancer in aging women. Women over age 65 who develop breast cancers have greater death rates and poorer outcomes. These women also bear the heaviest burden of ""overdiagnosis"" a phenomenon in which screening identifies cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death. These sobering statistics are made more urgent by the realization that the number of women > 65 is projected to more than double (from 20-40 million) between 2000 and 2050. In this research program, we propose to develop tools that will improve the early diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, minimize unnecessary invasive procedures (decrease false positives) and concomitantly address overdiagnosis. Specifically we aim to 1) develop a probabilistic computer model trained by a novel machine learning algorithm, Prediction using Logical Uplift Modeling (PLUM), that tailors breast cancer risk estimations to aging women; 2) use a decision analytic model to determine the optimal breast biopsy threshold using an important pathologic prognostic indicator, cytologic grade in the context of age, and 3) use comparative effectiveness analysis to determine how these personalized risk prediction strategies and optimal thresholds for action will improve on current breast cancer screening policies in women > 65. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical, engineering, and computer science literature) of innovative research that integrates state-of-the-art informatics algorithms to improve breast cancer diagnosis. Using prior experience and infrastructure, we are building a completely new machine learning algorithm, PLUM, which uses 1) inductive logic programming (ILP) to accurately learn from multi-relational data; 2) uplift modeling that uses age as a partition, and 3) rule incorporation into our probabilistic model for accurate risk prediction. We necessarily use a uniquely rich clinical data, a deep understanding of disease processes, and creative integration of these computational tools. New preliminary data presented in this resubmission foreshadow scientific success and clinical translation. If supported, this project will prove that risk prediction and decision analytic tools can accurately assess breast cancer risk, determine an optimal, personalized biopsy threshold, and provide a superior breast cancer screening policy than is currently employed in the US for women over age 65.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women over the age of 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized software tools that predict breast cancer risk and prognosis are needed to avoid late diagnosis, morbidity and mortality, as well as minimize false positives and overdiagnosis (cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death). Our multidisciplinary team of breast cancer physicians/experts, engineers, and computer scientists propose to build models that can predict breast cancer risk, determine the optimal management of mammography findings based on this risk, and the population impact of these tools for women over 65 in the US.                  Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women over the age of 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population.

"Mammographic Density and Tissue Asymmetry Based Breast Cancer Risk Stratification     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite being one of the leading cancers in women, breast cancer detection rates in a repeat screened population are quite low (i.e., 3 to 5 cancers detected per 1000 examinations). Screening for the early detection of breast cancer has been controversial from the start, but recent events highlight the need to develop and optimize individualized screening regimens by identifying women who are at higher than average risk of developing breast cancer in the near future, namely within five years. Establishing optimal individualized screening regimens that facilitate women to be screened at different intervals and/or with different imaging methods based on their assigned risk group will not only increase sensitivity, resulting in the detection of earlier cancers, but also reduce overall cost and anxiet associated with screening programs. Breast cancer risk assessment has been studied for many years; however, due to reasonably low positive predictive values there are no existing risk models that are universally accepted in routine clinical practice, in particular as related to screening and diagnosis. There is no doubt that a breast cancer risk model with high discriminatory power will enable an increase in efficiency, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of screening paradigms. We propose to develop and test an innovative risk predictor that is based primarily on computed image features representing bilateral mammographic tissue density asymmetry between left and right breasts. As important, we will develop and test this predictor using mammograms acquired prior to any depiction of a highly suspicious abnormality leading to a biopsy and/or a verification of cancer. To achieve our objectives we will assemble a large and diverse image database of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images with sequentially available images and related clinical information. The database will include three groups of cases, namely (1) positive cases that were verified to have cancer one to six years after the first available negative FFDM examination, (2) screening negative cases that have not been recalled during the period of interest, and (3) recalled and/or biopsied cases due to suspicious mammographic findings, but later proven to be negative or benign. Computed bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry features will be used to develop the new risk predictor. In addition to evaluating the overall classification performance on the entire database, we will investigate the reproducibility of the predictor's results and the relationship between predictor's classification performance and the time lag between a negative FFDM in question and the first recall due to the actual detection of a highly suspicious finding leading to a biopsy and/or a confirmed cancer. We will also assess the impact, if any, of several other commonly used risk factors (i.e., age, family history, and breast density BIRADS) on predictor's performance. A bootstrapping method will be used to compute predictor's performance levels and 95% confidence intervals. By incorporating this risk predictor with other existing risk models, we will investigate the feasibility of improving discriminatory power in predicting risk of individual women developing breast cancer in near-term (<5 years).        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application aims to develop and test an innovative breast cancer risk predictor based primarily (but not solely) on bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry as measured from a single negative mammography examination. We aim to identify women who are at high and/or low risk of developing breast cancer during the time period of 1 to 5 years following a negative examination. This information could be used for developing a highly discriminative model of the breast-cancer risk that could be then used for designing optimal individualized screening plans.                  This application aims to develop and test an innovative breast cancer risk predictor based primarily (but not solely) on bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry as measured from a single negative mammography examination.

"Bayesian Rule Learning Methods for Disease Prediction and Biomarker Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The problem: High-throughput biomedical data from biomarker profiling studies aimed at early detection of diseases like lung cancer are accumulating rapidly. Although many popular machine learning methods have been utilized for analysis of such high-dimensional datasets, no single method has consistently outperformed others. Moreover, scientists have the need to simultaneously address two related tasks: disease prediction and biomarker discovery, using the same sets of data and tools. One way, as undertaken in this project, to address this need is to find the most accurate classifier for the disease from a given set of profiles and present the discriminative markers used in that model to the scientist for further verification. The large space of possible models coupled with the small sample size of the data make it hard to accurately estimate predictive accuracy.       The solution: This project will develop, evaluate and refine novel Bayesian Rule Learning (BRL) methods that are algorithmically efficient, result in parsimonious models and accurately estimate predictive uncertainty from sparse biomedical datasets. BRL methods utilize a Bayesian score to evaluate rule models, thereby quantifying the uncertainty in the validity of the rule itself. This novel technique that combines the mathematical rigor of Bayesian network learning with rule-based modeling opens up a hitherto underexplored area of fundamental research in informatics involving such hybrid methodologies. Rules enable modular representation of knowledge and collaboration with scientists, as it is easier to present the model and extract markers both visually and computationally. Rule-based inference is also simpler and more tractable. The Bayesian approach enables prior knowledge to be incorporated and evaluated in a continual fashion with a human in the loop. The latter is very important for refinement of both tools and models.       The specific aims: This project will test the hypothesis that the BRL methods developed and extended herein produce more accurate and parsimonious models for disease state prediction than other state-of-the-art machine learning methods. This project evaluates BRL methods and models using existing proteomic datasets for three diverse diseases - rare, neurodegenerative Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and the two most common cancers in the world, lung and breast cancers. Experimental verification will be performed using a new set of retrospectively collected breast cancer sera samples to evaluate model generalizability.       The significance: This project will produce: (1) a novel biomedical data mining tool for analyzing data from biomarker profiling studies of any disease, (2) methodological insights into the applicability of this tool and current machine learning methods for such tasks, and (3) new data for research on the early detection of breast cancer. It has potential to help develop new diagnostic tests for early detection of ALS, lung and breast cancers and lays a firm foundation for building modeling frameworks that can incorporate both prior knowledge and data to provide the technological capability for combining evidence from multiple, heterogeneous sources.           This project will develop highly-needed data mining methods for analyzing the spate of datasets  arising from high-throughput technologies for molecular biomarker profiling. It will generate  new experimental data for early detection of breast cancer, and has the potential to help create  new diagnostic screening tools for three diverse diseases: two of the most common cancers in  the world - lung and breast cancers, and rare, neurodegenerative Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

"Mechano-Visual Phenotyping of Cancer: From Onset Through Disease Progression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year. This translates to about 1560 deaths per day attributed to cancer - overall, in the US, 1 in every 4 deaths is attributed to cancer. In the US, cancer is the second most common cause of death only next to deaths due to heart disease. Future progress in several key areas of cancer research and drug discovery will rely upon the capacity of investigators to reliably detect, characterize and track subtle changes that occur in the tumor environment during the transformation from the benign to cancerous state. The central objective of this grant proposal is to design, develop and evaluate computational and imaging tools, which provide insight regarding the mechanical and morphological changes that occur starting with the onset of a malignancy and follow those changes throughout the course of disease progression using a representative ensemble of cancer tissue specimens from breast cancer cases. These new technologies will facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic and prognostic clues, which are not apparent using traditional methods of assessment.  The overarching objectives of the proposed project are: 1) to investigate changes in the mechanical characteristics of sampled tissues through accurate non-linear finite element modeling based on the experimentally captured atomic force microscopy (AFM) data, 2) to increase the sampling throughput to allow automated assessment of multiple regions of interest, simultaneously, using an array of micro force sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and 3) to compare the mechanical changes, expression signatures, and spatial distribution of biomarkers in the normal tissue samples with those collected at the onset of malignancy and throughout the primary stages of disease progression for breast cancer cases. Based on successful completion of these aims, we will design, develop and evaluate a reliable means for providing multimodal decision support for performing automated, higher-throughput characterization of specimens. Finally, our team will deploy, test and optimize the updated suite of computational and modeling tools at strategic adopter sites (Emory University and University of Pennsylvania - see letters of support).

"Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mammographic breast density (BD) is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. Most research studies generating this conclusion used an operator-assisted method (applied to digitized film) to estimate the percentage of BD (i.e. PD, the standard), which requires an expert technician to outline the breast region and define thresholds. Although clearly an invaluable research tool, this standard does not lend itself to automation, and is therefore not amenable for application in the clinical setting (i.e. large-scale implementation) for patient risk assessment and management. Our goal is to lay the foundation for translating the demonstrated research value of BD into the clinic by advancing our recent achievements in full field digital mammography (FFDM), the emerging standard modality for breast screening in the US. We developed a calibration system for FFDM using a specific unit that produced four significant findings: (1) a standardization technique that makes pixel values comparable across all images, (2) a new calibrated spatial variation BD measurement (or Vc) that offered a stronger measurement of risk than the standard, (3) Vc is a function of PD, another calibrated measure of BD that is also a significant risk factor, and other important risk covariates, i.e. high correlation but non-linear, and (4) demonstrated the variation measure (or V) applied to raw mammograms (or Vr) is also a significant breast cancer risk factor.  In this proposed work we build on our calibration approach and apply it to different FFDM units. We will validate the Vc and Vr measures from different FFDM technology and make comparisons with our previous findings using a matched case-control study using both pre-existing and new FFDM datasets. Because differences in detector designs have the potential to alter spatial variation, it is imperative to assess these influences n the new V-metrics to demonstrate that breast cancer risk is not dependent upon the system design. We will quantify the gains derived from calibration by comparing Vc and Vr, because gains are derived at the expense of advanced image processing and analyses. We will determine the optimal breast density measure and representation (i.e. is calibration required), where optimal is defined by these attributes: automated, quantitative, reproducible, consistent across different imaging platforms, and offers risk prediction at least equivalent with that offere by PD. To meet our objectives, we use accepted techniques and introduce novel analysis strategies that include statistical learning to better capture the relationships between the import risk covariates. This work will provide a prescription for making the optimal BD measurement. The successful completion of this work will allow the full scale integration of BD into the clinica environment. Potential applications include personalized care of patients in terms of screening frequency, risk reduction interventions, and the identification of situations where mammography may be ineffective (i.e. where dense tissue significantly reduces either sensitivity or specificityof mammography).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mammographic breast density is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. To date, the best way to calculate this measurement is not well understood. However, an operator-assisted measure is often used for research purposes. Due to measurement complexities breast density is not used for clinical based risk assessments. The focus of our work is full field digital mammography (FFDM). We use FFDM because the majority of accredited mammography facilities now operate FFDM units and FFDM will replace film systems eventually. Moreover, digital images from FFDM facilitate the processing methods. We are developing a method to measure this important factor from mammograms. We used experimental phantom imaging to adjust mammograms to make improved measures of breast density for full field digital mammography. Using advanced image processing techniques, we normalized mammograms so that they are comparable. This process allowed us to develop a new automated method of measuring breast density that shows stronger correlation with breast cancer than other measures. In this proposed work, we will explore the generalizations of our novel measure and evaluate it further with different types of mammography units. The work has important healthcare implications upon completion. This project will provide a technique that can be used in the clinic to (a) collect important serial brest density information, and (b) develop breast cancer risk models that include breast density.                ",Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density,8436915,R01CA166269,"['Accounting ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automation ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Calibration ', ' Environment ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Matched Case-Control Study ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Hospital Risk Reporting ', ' Risk Management ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Film ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Imaging Phantoms ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' brca 1 gene ', ' RNF53 ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 1 Gene ', ' BRCA1 ', ' BRCA1 gene ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modality ', ' Metric ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Mechano-Visual Phenotyping of Cancer: From Onset Through Disease Progression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year. This translates to about 1560 deaths per day attributed to cancer - overall, in the US, 1 in every 4 deaths is attributed to cancer. In the US, cancer is the second most common cause of death only next to deaths due to heart disease. Future progress in several key areas of cancer research and drug discovery will rely upon the capacity of investigators to reliably detect, characterize and track subtle changes that occur in the tumor environment during the transformation from the benign to cancerous state. The central objective of this grant proposal is to design, develop and evaluate computational and imaging tools, which provide insight regarding the mechanical and morphological changes that occur starting with the onset of a malignancy and follow those changes throughout the course of disease progression using a representative ensemble of cancer tissue specimens from breast cancer cases. These new technologies will facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic and prognostic clues, which are not apparent using traditional methods of assessment.  The overarching objectives of the proposed project are: 1) to investigate changes in the mechanical characteristics of sampled tissues through accurate non-linear finite element modeling based on the experimentally captured atomic force microscopy (AFM) data, 2) to increase the sampling throughput to allow automated assessment of multiple regions of interest, simultaneously, using an array of micro force sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and 3) to compare the mechanical changes, expression signatures, and spatial distribution of biomarkers in the normal tissue samples with those collected at the onset of malignancy and throughout the primary stages of disease progression for breast cancer cases. Based on successful completion of these aims, we will design, develop and evaluate a reliable means for providing multimodal decision support for performing automated, higher-throughput characterization of specimens. Finally, our team will deploy, test and optimize the updated suite of computational and modeling tools at strategic adopter sites (Emory University and University of Pennsylvania - see letters of support).

"Bayesian Rule Learning Methods for Disease Prediction and Biomarker Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The problem: High-throughput biomedical data from biomarker profiling studies aimed at early detection of diseases like lung cancer are accumulating rapidly. Although many popular machine learning methods have been utilized for analysis of such high-dimensional datasets, no single method has consistently outperformed others. Moreover, scientists have the need to simultaneously address two related tasks: disease prediction and biomarker discovery, using the same sets of data and tools. One way, as undertaken in this project, to address this need is to find the most accurate classifier for the disease from a given set of profiles and present the discriminative markers used in that model to the scientist for further verification. The large space of possible models coupled with the small sample size of the data make it hard to accurately estimate predictive accuracy.       The solution: This project will develop, evaluate and refine novel Bayesian Rule Learning (BRL) methods that are algorithmically efficient, result in parsimonious models and accurately estimate predictive uncertainty from sparse biomedical datasets. BRL methods utilize a Bayesian score to evaluate rule models, thereby quantifying the uncertainty in the validity of the rule itself. This novel technique that combines the mathematical rigor of Bayesian network learning with rule-based modeling opens up a hitherto underexplored area of fundamental research in informatics involving such hybrid methodologies. Rules enable modular representation of knowledge and collaboration with scientists, as it is easier to present the model and extract markers both visually and computationally. Rule-based inference is also simpler and more tractable. The Bayesian approach enables prior knowledge to be incorporated and evaluated in a continual fashion with a human in the loop. The latter is very important for refinement of both tools and models.       The specific aims: This project will test the hypothesis that the BRL methods developed and extended herein produce more accurate and parsimonious models for disease state prediction than other state-of-the-art machine learning methods. This project evaluates BRL methods and models using existing proteomic datasets for three diverse diseases - rare, neurodegenerative Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and the two most common cancers in the world, lung and breast cancers. Experimental verification will be performed using a new set of retrospectively collected breast cancer sera samples to evaluate model generalizability.       The significance: This project will produce: (1) a novel biomedical data mining tool for analyzing data from biomarker profiling studies of any disease, (2) methodological insights into the applicability of this tool and current machine learning methods for such tasks, and (3) new data for research on the early detection of breast cancer. It has potential to help develop new diagnostic tests for early detection of ALS, lung and breast cancers and lays a firm foundation for building modeling frameworks that can incorporate both prior knowledge and data to provide the technological capability for combining evidence from multiple, heterogeneous sources.           This project will develop highly-needed data mining methods for analyzing the spate of datasets  arising from high-throughput technologies for molecular biomarker profiling. It will generate  new experimental data for early detection of breast cancer, and has the potential to help create  new diagnostic screening tools for three diverse diseases: two of the most common cancers in  the world - lung and breast cancers, and rare, neurodegenerative Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

"Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and is characteristically an aggressive cancer, especially in a metastatic setting. Approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers are TNBC. In spite of recent improvements in TNBC treatment, the lack of known specific therapeutic targets and the heterogeneous response to chemotherapy make it difficult to attack TNBC and obtain a consistent outcome and meaningful benefit. Recently, cisplatin chemotherapy has regained interest based on growing evidence on achieving better outcome from preclinical and clinical data. However, many TNBC patients are not responding to the treatment; and there is no clinical practical way to identify in which individuals' cisplatin chemotherapy will be effective t avoid unnecessary toxicity and cost of healthcare.         The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, for identifying novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in TNBC more accurately and efficiently from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The recent discovery of the p63/p73 expression, p53 mutation and measurements of DNA repair status effects on the sensitivity to cisplatin in TNBC patients has indicated the existence of cisplatin response predictors and the need for further investigation. In this study, we will develo a novel sequence-based copy number variation (CNV) detection tool, using signal processing techniques; and a novel supervised integrative analysis tool, based on Bayesian network analysis which integrates CNV, point mutation and gene expression data. We will hone and validate the innovative methods and tools on publically available data such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Then by collaborating with oncologists and pathologists from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and using the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center DNA Resource Core services, we will generate novel DNA sequence and RNA- seq datasets on responsive and non-responsive TNBC tumor samples from an existing clinical trial, which was designed to study preoperative cisplatin in early-stage breast cancer. By applying the proposed computational framework we will shed unprecedented light on potential predictors of TNBC response to cisplatin therapy that can help guide biomarker selection. We will verify the candidate biomarkers through gene ontology and pathway analyses. In addition, we will analyze TCGA data to determine the prevalence of these candidate biomarkers in TNBC.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, to more accurately and efficiently identify novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from next-generation sequencing data. Successful completion of this proposal will result in two important public health impacts: (1) Candidate ""response"" biomarkers of cisplatin chemotherapy responsive TNBCs, and (2) A computational approach supporting personalized medicine for TNBC. Furthermore, once established, this framework can be extended to the detection of biomarkers in other tumor types, and can contribute to improving the drug development process and the effectiveness of

"Informatics Techniques to Optimize Mammography for Aging Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop, integrate, and evaluate novel informatics techniques to optimize the mammographic diagnosis of breast cancer in aging women. Women over age 65 who develop breast cancers have greater death rates and poorer outcomes. These women also bear the heaviest burden of ""overdiagnosis"" a phenomenon in which screening identifies cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death. These sobering statistics are made more urgent by the realization that the number of women > 65 is projected to more than double (from 20-40 million) between 2000 and 2050. In this research program, we propose to develop tools that will improve the early diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, minimize unnecessary invasive procedures (decrease false positives) and concomitantly address overdiagnosis. Specifically we aim to 1) develop a probabilistic computer model trained by a novel machine learning algorithm, Prediction using Logical Uplift Modeling (PLUM), that tailors breast cancer risk estimations to aging women; 2) use a decision analytic model to determine the optimal breast biopsy threshold using an important pathologic prognostic indicator, cytologic grade in the context of age, and 3) use comparative effectiveness analysis to determine how these personalized risk prediction strategies and optimal thresholds for action will improve on current breast cancer screening policies in women > 65. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical, engineering, and computer science literature) of innovative research that integrates state-of-the-art informatics algorithms to improve breast cancer diagnosis. Using prior experience and infrastructure, we are building a completely new machine learning algorithm, PLUM, which uses 1) inductive logic programming (ILP) to accurately learn from multi-relational data; 2) uplift modeling that uses age as a partition, and 3) rule incorporation into our probabilistic model for accurate risk prediction. We necessarily use a uniquely rich clinical data, a deep understanding of disease processes, and creative integration of these computational tools. New preliminary data presented in this resubmission foreshadow scientific success and clinical translation. If supported, this project will prove that risk prediction and decision analytic tools can accurately assess breast cancer risk, determine an optimal, personalized biopsy threshold, and provide a superior breast cancer screening policy than is currently employed in the US for women over age 65.          Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women over the age of 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized software tools that predict breast cancer risk and prognosis are needed to avoid late diagnosis, morbidity and mortality, as well as minimize false positives and overdiagnosis (cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death). Our multidisciplinary team of breast cancer physicians/experts, engineers, and computer scientists propose to build models that can predict breast cancer risk, determine the optimal management of mammography findings based on this risk, and the population impact of these tools for women over 65 in the US.

"Mammographic Density and Tissue Asymmetry Based Breast Cancer Risk Stratification     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite being one of the leading cancers in women, breast cancer detection rates in a repeat screened population are quite low (i.e., 3 to 5 cancers detected per 1000 examinations). Screening for the early detection of breast cancer has been controversial from the start, but recent events highlight the need to develop and optimize individualized screening regimens by identifying women who are at higher than average risk of developing breast cancer in the near future, namely within five years. Establishing optimal individualized screening regimens that facilitate women to be screened at different intervals and/or with different imaging methods based on their assigned risk group will not only increase sensitivity, resulting in the detection of earlier cancers, but also reduce overall cost and anxiet associated with screening programs. Breast cancer risk assessment has been studied for many years; however, due to reasonably low positive predictive values there are no existing risk models that are universally accepted in routine clinical practice, in particular as related to screening and diagnosis. There is no doubt that a breast cancer risk model with high discriminatory power will enable an increase in efficiency, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of screening paradigms. We propose to develop and test an innovative risk predictor that is based primarily on computed image features representing bilateral mammographic tissue density asymmetry between left and right breasts. As important, we will develop and test this predictor using mammograms acquired prior to any depiction of a highly suspicious abnormality leading to a biopsy and/or a verification of cancer. To achieve our objectives we will assemble a large and diverse image database of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images with sequentially available images and related clinical information. The database will include three groups of cases, namely (1) positive cases that were verified to have cancer one to six years after the first available negative FFDM examination, (2) screening negative cases that have not been recalled during the period of interest, and (3) recalled and/or biopsied cases due to suspicious mammographic findings, but later proven to be negative or benign. Computed bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry features will be used to develop the new risk predictor. In addition to evaluating the overall classification performance on the entire database, we will investigate the reproducibility of the predictor's results and the relationship between predictor's classification performance and the time lag between a negative FFDM in question and the first recall due to the actual detection of a highly suspicious finding leading to a biopsy and/or a confirmed cancer. We will also assess the impact, if any, of several other commonly used risk factors (i.e., age, family history, and breast density BIRADS) on predictor's performance. A bootstrapping method will be used to compute predictor's performance levels and 95% confidence intervals. By incorporating this risk predictor with other existing risk models, we will investigate the feasibility of improving discriminatory power in predicting risk of individual women developing breast cancer in near-term (<5 years).          This application aims to develop and test an innovative breast cancer risk predictor based primarily (but not solely) on bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry as measured from a single negative mammography examination. We aim to identify women who are at high and/or low risk of developing breast cancer during the time period of 1 to 5 years following a negative examination. This information could be used for developing a highly discriminative model of the breast-cancer risk that could be then used for designing optimal individualized screening plans.

"A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System  Critical clinical activities involve decision making. For both individual patients and for society at large, making good healthcare decisions is a paramount task. The objective of this research is to develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assist the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient.  Traditional clinical data are becoming increasingly available in electronic form. Unprecedentedly abundant genomic data are available to researchers as the results of advanced sequencing technologies such as next generation sequencing. Patient-specific genomic data are likely to become available for most patients in the foreseeable future. These sources of data provide significant opportunities for developing new generation clinical decision support systems that can achieve substantial progress over what is currently possible. However, the sheer magnitude of the number of variables in these data (often in the millions) presents formidable computational and modeling challenges. Also, integrating the heterogeneous information in multiple clinical datasets and genomic datasets presents an arduous challenge.  Breast cancer is the commonest cancer among women. Various breast cancer subtypes have been defined which, along with tumor stage, predict response to therapy and survival, albeit imperfectly. For example, HER2-amplified breast cancer is a subtype with poor prognosis, and therapy with an antibody to HER2 (Herceptin) has vastly improved the survival of such patients. Although Herceptin is used in the therapy of all patients with HER2-amplified tumors, only some respond. Also, it is expensive and can cause cardiac toxicity. So, it is important to give it only to patients benefiting from it. Studies show thousands of genes are associated with subtype and prognosis of breast cancer, and particular allele combinations may usefully guide the selection of effective treatment. The proposed system will amass all this genomic information and combine it with clinical information and therefore holds promise to provide accurate classification and treatment choices.  We will build the knowledge base of the proposed system using the following sources: 1) The Medical Archival Systems at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center; 2) The Lynn Sage Database used by the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center at Northwestern Memorial Hospital; 3) The breast cancer data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas project; and 4) Dream 7 Breast Cancer Challenge Data. The proposed system will build on previous results of the investigators in using Bayesian Network to learn from high-dimensional data sets. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record, including NIH funding, publications in biomedical informatics and artificial intelligence, and experience developing cutting-edge decision support systems.  Even a modest improvement in the efficacy of clinical decision making has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. This project will develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assist the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient. We call this system A Clinical Decision Support System for Making Personalized Assessments and Recommendations Concerning Breast Cancer Patients (DPAC).",A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System,8695607,R01LM011663,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Antibodies ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' Computer Programs and Programming ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' dreaming ', ' Dreams ', ' Electronics ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Hospitals ', ' Learning ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' neu Genes ', ' erbb2 [{C0242957}] ', ' erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 Proto-Oncogenes ', ' c-erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 ', ' TKR1 ', ' Human EGF Receptor 2 Gene ', ' HER2/neu ', ' HER2 Genes ', ' HER2 ', ' HER/2 ', ' HER-2 Genes ', ' HER-2 ', ' HER -2 ', ' ERBB2 ', ' ERBB2 gene ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Herceptin ', ' Roche brand of trastuzumab ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' novel ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' response ', ' Cardiac Toxicity ', ' Cardiotoxicity ', ' Genomics ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Process ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' clinical care ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,582816,0.2829097697003031
"Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) tend to be less responsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy than ER-negative breast cancers; advanced ER+ breast cancer remains largely incurable. Moreover, this breast cancer subtype frequently exhibits marked dormancy, conferring upon patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that persists for decades after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Why ER+ breast is the most strongly associated with dormancy is unknown and represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Since 70% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are ER+ but ~50% of these eventually recur, many doing so years after cessation of an otherwise apparently successful initial intervention, significance of the dormant phenotype is clear. Using transcriptome data from pretreatment tumors from women with ER+ breast cancer who were subsequently treated with tamoxifen (TAM) as their only systemic therapy, we derived an initial molecular classifier that robustly separates early (d 3 yrs) from late (e 5 yrs; emergence from dormancy) distant recurrences in both training and independent datasets. We then identified novel features of the ""early"" (E) vs. ""late"" (L) signaling network's topology in thse datasets. We also developed an adaptation of the DMBA-induced rat mammary tumor model and show that it represents E, L, and ""not"" (N) recurring tumors, molecular features of which are present in human breast tumors and cell lines. Mechanistically, our data implicate a ""rewiring"" (including epigenetic events) of the signaling from the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, and adaptations in cellular metabolism, as the molecular events that may enable cells to maintain, and later escape from, dormancy. Our central hypothesis is that dormancy reflects the growth arrest induced by endocrine therapies in both residual tumors (in-breast recurrences) and micro-metastases (distant recurrences), and that the signaling maintaining dormancy after systemic therapy ends is epigenetically regulated. Indeed, prolonged hormone therapy may well work by extending dormancy. Individual cells can emerge from dormancy as their metabolic capacity becomes sufficient to support both survival and replication, and the integrated balance between autophagy (prosurvival) and apoptosis (prodeath) signaling enables more cells in a tumor to proliferate and the tumor population size to grow. We propose an integrated, multidisciplinary research program that, if successful, will generate innovative insights into the molecular drivers of dormancy in ER+ breast cancers, develop new in silico signaling models, identify predictors of patient risk to experience a late recurrence, and explore mechanisms of dormancy with the longer term goal of discovering potentially novel therapeutic interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) comprise 70% of all newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers. ER+ breast tumors represent the breast cancer subtype most strongly associated with tumor dormancy, conferring upon these patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that can persist for decades after initial diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, very little is known abou the molecular drivers that determine the onset, maintenance, and emergence from dormancy. Our multidisciplinary team will apply state-of-the-art technologies to several unique, independent, human breast cancer data sets (including matched primary and recurrent tumors from the same

"Informatics Techniques to Optimize Mammography for Aging Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop, integrate, and evaluate novel informatics techniques to optimize the mammographic diagnosis of breast cancer in aging women. Women over age 65 who develop breast cancers have greater death rates and poorer outcomes. These women also bear the heaviest burden of ""overdiagnosis"" a phenomenon in which screening identifies cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death. These sobering statistics are made more urgent by the realization that the number of women > 65 is projected to more than double (from 20-40 million) between 2000 and 2050. In this research program, we propose to develop tools that will improve the early diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, minimize unnecessary invasive procedures (decrease false positives) and concomitantly address overdiagnosis. Specifically we aim to 1) develop a probabilistic computer model trained by a novel machine learning algorithm, Prediction using Logical Uplift Modeling (PLUM), that tailors breast cancer risk estimations to aging women; 2) use a decision analytic model to determine the optimal breast biopsy threshold using an important pathologic prognostic indicator, cytologic grade in the context of age, and 3) use comparative effectiveness analysis to determine how these personalized risk prediction strategies and optimal thresholds for action will improve on current breast cancer screening policies in women > 65. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical, engineering, and computer science literature) of innovative research that integrates state-of-the-art informatics algorithms to improve breast cancer diagnosis. Using prior experience and infrastructure, we are building a completely new machine learning algorithm, PLUM, which uses 1) inductive logic programming (ILP) to accurately learn from multi-relational data; 2) uplift modeling that uses age as a partition, and 3) rule incorporation into our probabilistic model for accurate risk prediction. We necessarily use a uniquely rich clinical data, a deep understanding of disease processes, and creative integration of these computational tools. New preliminary data presented in this resubmission foreshadow scientific success and clinical translation. If supported, this project will prove that risk prediction and decision analytic tools can accurately assess breast cancer risk, determine an optimal, personalized biopsy threshold, and provide a superior breast cancer screening policy than is currently employed in the US for women over age 65.          Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women over the age of 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized software tools that predict breast cancer risk and prognosis are needed to avoid late diagnosis, morbidity and mortality, as well as minimize false positives and overdiagnosis (cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death). Our multidisciplinary team of breast cancer physicians/experts, engineers, and computer scientists propose to build models that can predict breast cancer risk, determine the optimal management of mammography findings based on this risk, and the population impact of these tools for women over 65 in the US.

"Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mammographic breast density (BD) is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. Most research studies generating this conclusion used an operator-assisted method (applied to digitized film) to estimate the percentage of BD (i.e. PD, the standard), which requires an expert technician to outline the breast region and define thresholds. Although clearly an invaluable research tool, this standard does not lend itself to automation, and is therefore not amenable for application in the clinical setting (i.e. large-scale implementation) for patient risk assessment and management. Our goal is to lay the foundation for translating the demonstrated research value of BD into the clinic by advancing our recent achievements in full field digital mammography (FFDM), the emerging standard modality for breast screening in the US. We developed a calibration system for FFDM using a specific unit that produced four significant findings: (1) a standardization technique that makes pixel values comparable across all images, (2) a new calibrated spatial variation BD measurement (or Vc) that offered a stronger measurement of risk than the standard, (3) Vc is a function of PD, another calibrated measure of BD that is also a significant risk factor, and other important risk covariates, i.e. high correlation but non-linear, and (4) demonstrated the variation measure (or V) applied to raw mammograms (or Vr) is also a significant breast cancer risk factor.  In this proposed work we build on our calibration approach and apply it to different FFDM units. We will validate the Vc and Vr measures from different FFDM technology and make comparisons with our previous findings using a matched case-control study using both pre-existing and new FFDM datasets. Because differences in detector designs have the potential to alter spatial variation, it is imperative to assess these influences n the new V-metrics to demonstrate that breast cancer risk is not dependent upon the system design. We will quantify the gains derived from calibration by comparing Vc and Vr, because gains are derived at the expense of advanced image processing and analyses. We will determine the optimal breast density measure and representation (i.e. is calibration required), where optimal is defined by these attributes: automated, quantitative, reproducible, consistent across different imaging platforms, and offers risk prediction at least equivalent with that offere by PD. To meet our objectives, we use accepted techniques and introduce novel analysis strategies that include statistical learning to better capture the relationships between the import risk covariates. This work will provide a prescription for making the optimal BD measurement. The successful completion of this work will allow the full scale integration of BD into the clinica environment. Potential applications include personalized care of patients in terms of screening frequency, risk reduction interventions, and the identification of situations where mammography may be ineffective (i.e. where dense tissue significantly reduces either sensitivity or specificityof mammography).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mammographic breast density is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. To date, the best way to calculate this measurement is not well understood. However, an operator-assisted measure is often used for research purposes. Due to measurement complexities breast density is not used for clinical based risk assessments. The focus of our work is full field digital mammography (FFDM). We use FFDM because the majority of accredited mammography facilities now operate FFDM units and FFDM will replace film systems eventually. Moreover, digital images from FFDM facilitate the processing methods. We are developing a method to measure this important factor from mammograms. We used experimental phantom imaging to adjust mammograms to make improved measures of breast density for full field digital mammography. Using advanced image processing techniques, we normalized mammograms so that they are comparable. This process allowed us to develop a new automated method of measuring breast density that shows stronger correlation with breast cancer than other measures. In this proposed work, we will explore the generalizations of our novel measure and evaluate it further with different types of mammography units. The work has important healthcare implications upon completion. This project will provide a technique that can be used in the clinic to (a) collect important serial brest density information, and (b) develop breast cancer risk models that include breast density.                ",Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density,8625722,R01CA166269,"['Accounting ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automation ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Calibration ', ' Environment ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Matched Case-Control Study ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Hospital Risk Reporting ', ' Risk Management ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Film ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Imaging Phantoms ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' brca 1 gene ', ' RNF53 ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 1 Gene ', ' BRCA1 ', ' BRCA1 gene ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modality ', ' Metric ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Mammographic Density and Tissue Asymmetry Based Breast Cancer Risk Stratification     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite being one of the leading cancers in women, breast cancer detection rates in a repeat screened population are quite low (i.e., 3 to 5 cancers detected per 1000 examinations). Screening for the early detection of breast cancer has been controversial from the start, but recent events highlight the need to develop and optimize individualized screening regimens by identifying women who are at higher than average risk of developing breast cancer in the near future, namely within five years. Establishing optimal individualized screening regimens that facilitate women to be screened at different intervals and/or with different imaging methods based on their assigned risk group will not only increase sensitivity, resulting in the detection of earlier cancers, but also reduce overall cost and anxiet associated with screening programs. Breast cancer risk assessment has been studied for many years; however, due to reasonably low positive predictive values there are no existing risk models that are universally accepted in routine clinical practice, in particular as related to screening and diagnosis. There is no doubt that a breast cancer risk model with high discriminatory power will enable an increase in efficiency, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of screening paradigms. We propose to develop and test an innovative risk predictor that is based primarily on computed image features representing bilateral mammographic tissue density asymmetry between left and right breasts. As important, we will develop and test this predictor using mammograms acquired prior to any depiction of a highly suspicious abnormality leading to a biopsy and/or a verification of cancer. To achieve our objectives we will assemble a large and diverse image database of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images with sequentially available images and related clinical information. The database will include three groups of cases, namely (1) positive cases that were verified to have cancer one to six years after the first available negative FFDM examination, (2) screening negative cases that have not been recalled during the period of interest, and (3) recalled and/or biopsied cases due to suspicious mammographic findings, but later proven to be negative or benign. Computed bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry features will be used to develop the new risk predictor. In addition to evaluating the overall classification performance on the entire database, we will investigate the reproducibility of the predictor's results and the relationship between predictor's classification performance and the time lag between a negative FFDM in question and the first recall due to the actual detection of a highly suspicious finding leading to a biopsy and/or a confirmed cancer. We will also assess the impact, if any, of several other commonly used risk factors (i.e., age, family history, and breast density BIRADS) on predictor's performance. A bootstrapping method will be used to compute predictor's performance levels and 95% confidence intervals. By incorporating this risk predictor with other existing risk models, we will investigate the feasibility of improving discriminatory power in predicting risk of individual women developing breast cancer in near-term (<5 years).          This application aims to develop and test an innovative breast cancer risk predictor based primarily (but not solely) on bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry as measured from a single negative mammography examination. We aim to identify women who are at high and/or low risk of developing breast cancer during the time period of 1 to 5 years following a negative examination. This information could be used for developing a highly discriminative model of the breast-cancer risk that could be then used for designing optimal individualized screening plans.

"Integrating Machine Learning and Physician Expertise for Breast Cancer Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop novel machine learning techniques to integrate physician expertise and machine learned, logical rules in a graphical model that will accurately estimate breast cancer risk after breast biopsy. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical and computer science literature) illustrating an innovative research program that merges cutting edge machine learning algorithms including inductive logic programming and statistical relational learning to train graphical models to predict breast cancer risk. However, in contrast to prior work, we are testing a completely new methodology which we call Advice-Based-Learning (ABLe). By developing ABLe, our team aims to establish an innovative, collaborative cycle between machine-learning and physician expertise. We propose to test the hypothesis that this cycle will increase accuracy beyond what either the machine or human can accomplish alone. Specifically, we hypothesize first that a conventionally-trained graphical model trained with conventional machine learning first algorithms can accurately predict the risk of breast cancer after core biopsy and perform better than current clinical practice; a critical aim that is favorably foreshadowed by our new preliminary data but is labor intensive because we must perfect our unique clinical data that accurately represents clinical experience. Second, a graphical model trained using ABLe can incorporate multi-relational data with physician expertise and significantly improve the predictive accuracy over conventionally trained graphical models and current clinical practice. Third, our best graphical model trained with ABLe will accurately estimate the probability of malignancy after breast biopsy on new clinical cases better than physicians alone resulting in a tool that has the potential to improve care.       Our clinical application is as compelling as our algorithmic work. Image-guided core needle biopsy of the breast is a common procedure that is imperfect, has high-stakes, and is particularly amenable to improvement with automated decision support. Breast core biopsy, the standard of care for breast cancer diagnosis, can be ""non-definitive"" in 5-15% of women undergoing this procedure. This means that between 35,000-105,000 women will require additional biopsies or radiologic follow-up to cement a diagnosis and risk the possibility of missed breast cancers, delays in diagnosis, and unnecessary surgeries. This important problem is emblematic of a plethora of clinical situations where rigorous and accurate risk estimation of rare events provides the opportunity for automated decisions support tools to personalize and strategically target health care interventions to improve decision-making for health-care providers and patients. This award will enable us not only to produce graphical models that provide improved decision support in the breast cancer clinic, but also, and more significantly, to develop a methodology that integrates heterogeneous predictive data and physician knowledge within a graphical model, thereby developing and validating a new algorithmic paradigm for creating accurate, comprehensible, adaptable decision support tools well-suited for clinical translation.          PROJECT NARRATIVE Our multidisciplinary group of breast cancer physicians and computer scientists propose to develop a new paradigm for construction of clinical decision support tools that will integrate machine learning (computers learning from data) and physician expertise in order to perform better than either alone. Our system will be able to accurately estimate the true risk of malignancy after breast core biopsy addressing the challenges of delays in diagnosis and unnecessary surgeries encountered on the road to early breast cancer diagnosis.",Integrating Machine Learning and Physician Expertise for Breast Cancer Diagnosis,8707554,R01LM010921,"['Algorithms ', ' Award ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Computers ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Logic ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Medical Computer Science ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sampling Errors ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Excisional Biopsy ', ' Excision biopsy ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Unnecessary Surgery ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' empowered ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' model design ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Core Needle Biopsy ', ' Core Biopsy ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' Coupling ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' 20 year old ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' standard of care ', ' clinical practice ', ' shared decision making ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2014,307825,0.3088597692826162
"Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and is characteristically an aggressive cancer, especially in a metastatic setting. Approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers are TNBC. In spite of recent improvements in TNBC treatment, the lack of known specific therapeutic targets and the heterogeneous response to chemotherapy make it difficult to attack TNBC and obtain a consistent outcome and meaningful benefit. Recently, cisplatin chemotherapy has regained interest based on growing evidence on achieving better outcome from preclinical and clinical data. However, many TNBC patients are not responding to the treatment; and there is no clinical practical way to identify in which individuals' cisplatin chemotherapy will be effective t avoid unnecessary toxicity and cost of healthcare.         The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, for identifying novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in TNBC more accurately and efficiently from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The recent discovery of the p63/p73 expression, p53 mutation and measurements of DNA repair status effects on the sensitivity to cisplatin in TNBC patients has indicated the existence of cisplatin response predictors and the need for further investigation. In this study, we will develo a novel sequence-based copy number variation (CNV) detection tool, using signal processing techniques; and a novel supervised integrative analysis tool, based on Bayesian network analysis which integrates CNV, point mutation and gene expression data. We will hone and validate the innovative methods and tools on publically available data such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Then by collaborating with oncologists and pathologists from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and using the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center DNA Resource Core services, we will generate novel DNA sequence and RNA- seq datasets on responsive and non-responsive TNBC tumor samples from an existing clinical trial, which was designed to study preoperative cisplatin in early-stage breast cancer. By applying the proposed computational framework we will shed unprecedented light on potential predictors of TNBC response to cisplatin therapy that can help guide biomarker selection. We will verify the candidate biomarkers through gene ontology and pathway analyses. In addition, we will analyze TCGA data to determine the prevalence of these candidate biomarkers in TNBC.             PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, to more accurately and efficiently identify novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from next-generation sequencing data. Successful completion of this proposal will result in two important public health impacts: (1) Candidate ""response"" biomarkers of cisplatin chemotherapy responsive TNBCs, and (2) A computational approach supporting personalized medicine for TNBC.

"Mechano-Visual Phenotyping of Cancer: From Onset Through Disease Progression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year. This translates to about 1560 deaths per day attributed to cancer - overall, in the US, 1 in every 4 deaths is attributed to cancer. In the US, cancer is the second most common cause of death only next to deaths due to heart disease. Future progress in several key areas of cancer research and drug discovery will rely upon the capacity of investigators to reliably detect, characterize and track subtle changes that occur in the tumor environment during the transformation from the benign to cancerous state. The central objective of this grant proposal is to design, develop and evaluate computational and imaging tools, which provide insight regarding the mechanical and morphological changes that occur starting with the onset of a malignancy and follow those changes throughout the course of disease progression using a representative ensemble of cancer tissue specimens from breast cancer cases. These new technologies will facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic and prognostic clues, which are not apparent using traditional methods of assessment.  The overarching objectives of the proposed project are: 1) to investigate changes in the mechanical characteristics of sampled tissues through accurate non-linear finite element modeling based on the experimentally captured atomic force microscopy (AFM) data, 2) to increase the sampling throughput to allow automated assessment of multiple regions of interest, simultaneously, using an array of micro force sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and 3) to compare the mechanical changes, expression signatures, and spatial distribution of biomarkers in the normal tissue samples with those collected at the onset of malignancy and throughout the primary stages of disease progression for breast cancer cases. Based on successful completion of these aims, we will design, develop and evaluate a reliable means for providing multimodal decision support for performing automated, higher-throughput characterization of specimens.

"Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk Project Summary/Abstract Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women at the age of 40 and older. Mammography has been used as a low-cost screening tool for breast cancer. The recent controversy on breast cancer screening recommendations has increased public awareness and interests for informed counseling of screening and health care options based on individualized estimates of risk. The goal of this proposed project is to develop a computerized image-based biomarker to assess the breast cancer risk of individual patients in the screening population. The innovation of our approach lies in the fact that the quantitative breast parenchyma descriptor (q-BPD) will be designed to take into account not only the percentage of dense tissue (PD) but also the stromal and epithelial structural pattern of an individual's breast that is complementary to, rather than a surrogate of, the breast density. The q-BPD is obtained by a joint analysis of the complexity of the parenchymal distribution pattern (mammographic parenchymal pattern, MPP) and the amount of dense tissue (PD) as they are imaged on full-field digital mammograms (FFDMs). We hypothesize that the proposed q-BPD is an independent risk factor for breast cancer and will have a stronger predictive power than previous approaches such as PD or BI-RADS density categories alone. To test the hypothesis, we have the following specific aims: (1) to collect a matched case-control data set of 500 breast cancer cases and 2000 matched controls with 5 years of prior FFDMs (prior to cancer diagnosis for the case group). We will split the entire data set into independent subsets for training and validation; (2) to design a q- BPD by using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to maximize the discriminatory power at the personal level; (3) to investigate the association of developed q-BPD with breast cancer risk in comparison with commonly used density descriptors, such as radiologist's estimates of BI-RADS density categories and interactive PD on FFDMs by case-control studies and statistical analyses, taking into account other confounding risk factors. When fully developed, the automated q-BPD can be incorporated as a part of routine breast cancer screening. It will not only be useful for breast cancer risk prediction for individual patients but also for monitoring of risk regression or progression over time due to treatment or other factors. The new risk prediction tool is expected to play a key role in personalized breast cancer screening for women at different risk levels, thereby reducing health care costs while benefiting high risk women. The success of this project will lay the foundation for future large-scale clinica trials to address the limitations and investigate the clinical utilities of the proposed q-BPD for breast cancer risk prediction. Key Words: quantitative breast parenchyma analysis, image-based biomarker, breast cancer risk prediction, full-field digital mammogram (FFDM)         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed quantitative descriptor of breast parenchyma (q-BPD) can serve as a cost-effective biomarker to assist in stratification of screening strategy for individuals, follow-up, risk management, and monitoring of preventive treatment of high-risk women or interventional treatment of breast cancer patients, as well as for research and development of new treatment regimens. This will be a step towards the development of personalized medicine and reducing the overall health care costs.            ",Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk,8890485,U01CA195599,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Age ', ' Awareness ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Cause of Death ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Counseling ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Hospital Risk Reporting ', ' Risk Management ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissue Distribution ', ' Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Epithelial ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' Descriptor ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Contralateral ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' cancer risk ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Gail model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized medicine ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2015,412385,0.4028580200380851
"Machine Learning Comparison of Brain Anatomy in Cancer and Alzheimer's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties with cognitive skills such as memory, thinking and attention are very common after breast cancer chemotherapy. These cognitive difficulties have been associated with chemotherapy-related injury to several brain regions, particularly those regions that also tend to be affected by brain aging. There is concern that chemotherapy may accelerate brain aging and increase patients' risk for Alzheimer's disease. Certain previous studies support this concern while others do not and therefore the effect of breast cancer chemotherapy on risk for Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. The proposed research will compare brain anatomy of breast cancer survivors to that of women who later developed Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, we will determine a pattern of brain anatomy that indicates the probability of developing Alzheimer's disease. This pattern, or classifier, will be determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that were obtained for approximately 100 women with Alzheimer's disease compared to MRI scans from a group of approximately 100 healthy, unaffected women. We will then apply the classifier to MRI scans from 108 breast cancer survivors, 67 who received chemotherapy treatment and 41 who did not. Using the machine learning classifier, we will calculate a score for each breast cancer survivor that indicates her probability of developing Alzheimer's disease based on her brain anatomy. We believe that probability scores will be significantly higher in the chemotherapy group compared to the no-chemotherapy group. We will also explore possible predictors of probability score such as demographic, disease, genetic and treatment factors. This project has the potential to improve our ability to identify patients at risk for persistent and/or progressive chemotherapy-related brain injury using a simple, non-invasive five minute MRI scan. This information could potentially inform treatment decision-making and prioritize patients for early intervention.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of women who receive chemotherapy for breast cancer will experience long- term problems with brain function, such as thinking, memory and attention that reduce quality of life and extend disease-related disability. The proposed study aims to improve our understanding regarding the brain changes that occur following breast cancer chemotherapy. This research is highly relevant to breast cancer, one of the most common public health problems, affecting 1 in 8 women.            ",Machine Learning Comparison of Brain Anatomy in Cancer and Alzheimer's Disease,8813205,R03CA191559,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cognition ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Laboratories ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' human APOE epsilon4 protein ', ' apolipoprotein E4 ', ' apoE4 ', ' apoE-4 ', ' apo epsilon4 ', ' apo E4 ', ' apo E-4 ', ' apolipoprotein E-4 ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' brain lesion (from injury) ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Host Factor ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cancer chemotherapy ', ' Quimioterapia ', ' Combination Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy, Cancer, General ', ' Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy Protocol ', ' Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure ', ' Diffuse Brain Injury ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Treatment Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Brain region ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Derivation ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' chemo brain ', ' chemobrain ', ' cognitive reserve ', ' Outcome ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' neuropsychological ', ' chemotherapy ', ' aging brain ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R03,2015,80000,0.2031629751593532
"Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mammographic breast density (BD) is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. Most research studies generating this conclusion used an operator-assisted method (applied to digitized film) to estimate the percentage of BD (i.e. PD, the standard), which requires an expert technician to outline the breast region and define thresholds. Although clearly an invaluable research tool, this standard does not lend itself to automation, and is therefore not amenable for application in the clinical setting (i.e. large-scale implementation) for patient risk assessment and management. Our goal is to lay the foundation for translating the demonstrated research value of BD into the clinic by advancing our recent achievements in full field digital mammography (FFDM), the emerging standard modality for breast screening in the US. We developed a calibration system for FFDM using a specific unit that produced four significant findings: (1) a standardization technique that makes pixel values comparable across all images, (2) a new calibrated spatial variation BD measurement (or Vc) that offered a stronger measurement of risk than the standard, (3) Vc is a function of PD, another calibrated measure of BD that is also a significant risk factor, and other important risk covariates, i.e. high correlation but non-linear, and (4) demonstrated the variation measure (or V) applied to raw mammograms (or Vr) is also a significant breast cancer risk factor.  In this proposed work we build on our calibration approach and apply it to different FFDM units. We will validate the Vc and Vr measures from different FFDM technology and make comparisons with our previous findings using a matched case-control study using both pre-existing and new FFDM datasets. Because differences in detector designs have the potential to alter spatial variation, it is imperative to assess these influences n the new V-metrics to demonstrate that breast cancer risk is not dependent upon the system design. We will quantify the gains derived from calibration by comparing Vc and Vr, because gains are derived at the expense of advanced image processing and analyses. We will determine the optimal breast density measure and representation (i.e. is calibration required), where optimal is defined by these attributes: automated, quantitative, reproducible, consistent across different imaging platforms, and offers risk prediction at least equivalent with that offere by PD. To meet our objectives, we use accepted techniques and introduce novel analysis strategies that include statistical learning to better capture the relationships between the import risk covariates. This work will provide a prescription for making the optimal BD measurement. The successful completion of this work will allow the full scale integration of BD into the clinica environment. Potential applications include personalized care of patients in terms of screening frequency, risk reduction interventions, and the identification of situations where mammography may be ineffective (i.e. where dense tissue significantly reduces either sensitivity or specificityof mammography).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mammographic breast density is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. To date, the best way to calculate this measurement is not well understood. However, an operator-assisted measure is often used for research purposes. Due to measurement complexities breast density is not used for clinical based risk assessments. The focus of our work is full field digital mammography (FFDM). We use FFDM because the majority of accredited mammography facilities now operate FFDM units and FFDM will replace film systems eventually. Moreover, digital images from FFDM facilitate the processing methods. We are developing a method to measure this important factor from mammograms. We used experimental phantom imaging to adjust mammograms to make improved measures of breast density for full field digital mammography. Using advanced image processing techniques, we normalized mammograms so that they are comparable. This process allowed us to develop a new automated method of measuring breast density that shows stronger correlation with breast cancer than other measures. In this proposed work, we will explore the generalizations of our novel measure and evaluate it further with different types of mammography units. The work has important healthcare implications upon completion. This project will provide a technique that can be used in the clinic to (a) collect important serial brest density information, and (b) develop breast cancer risk models that include breast density.                ",Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density,8817150,R01CA166269,"['Accounting ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automation ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Calibration ', ' Environment ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Matched Case-Control Study ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Hospital Risk Reporting ', ' Risk Management ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Film ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Imaging Phantoms ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' brca 1 gene ', ' RNF53 ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 1 Gene ', ' BRCA1 ', ' BRCA1 gene ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modality ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' public health relevance ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and is characteristically an aggressive cancer, especially in a metastatic setting. Approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers are TNBC. In spite of recent improvements in TNBC treatment, the lack of known specific therapeutic targets and the heterogeneous response to chemotherapy make it difficult to attack TNBC and obtain a consistent outcome and meaningful benefit. Recently, cisplatin chemotherapy has regained interest based on growing evidence on achieving better outcome from preclinical and clinical data. However, many TNBC patients are not responding to the treatment; and there is no clinical practical way to identify in which individuals' cisplatin chemotherapy will be effective t avoid unnecessary toxicity and cost of healthcare.         The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, for identifying novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in TNBC more accurately and efficiently from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The recent discovery of the p63/p73 expression, p53 mutation and measurements of DNA repair status effects on the sensitivity to cisplatin in TNBC patients has indicated the existence of cisplatin response predictors and the need for further investigation. In this study, we will develo a novel sequence-based copy number variation (CNV) detection tool, using signal processing techniques; and a novel supervised integrative analysis tool, based on Bayesian network analysis which integrates CNV, point mutation and gene expression data. We will hone and validate the innovative methods and tools on publically available data such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Then by collaborating with oncologists and pathologists from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and using the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center DNA Resource Core services, we will generate novel DNA sequence and RNA- seq datasets on responsive and non-responsive TNBC tumor samples from an existing clinical trial, which was designed to study preoperative cisplatin in early-stage breast cancer. By applying the proposed computational framework we will shed unprecedented light on potential predictors of TNBC response to cisplatin therapy that can help guide biomarker selection. We will verify the candidate biomarkers through gene ontology and pathway analyses. In addition, we will analyze TCGA data to determine the prevalence of these candidate biomarkers in TNBC. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, to more accurately and efficiently identify novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from next-generation sequencing data. Successful completion of this proposal will result in two important public health impacts: (1) Candidate ""response"" biomarkers of cisplatin chemotherapy responsive TNBCs, and (2) A computational approach supporting personalized medicine for TNBC. Furthermore, once established, this framework can be extended to the detection of biomarkers in other tumor types, and can contribute to improving the drug development process and the effectiveness of

"Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) tend to be less responsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy than ER-negative breast cancers; advanced ER+ breast cancer remains largely incurable. Moreover, this breast cancer subtype frequently exhibits marked dormancy, conferring upon patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that persists for decades after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Why ER+ breast is the most strongly associated with dormancy is unknown and represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Since 70% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are ER+ but ~50% of these eventually recur, many doing so years after cessation of an otherwise apparently successful initial intervention, significance of the dormant phenotype is clear. Using transcriptome data from pretreatment tumors from women with ER+ breast cancer who were subsequently treated with tamoxifen (TAM) as their only systemic therapy, we derived an initial molecular classifier that robustly separates early (d 3 yrs) from late (e 5 yrs; emergence from dormancy) distant recurrences in both training and independent datasets. We then identified novel features of the ""early"" (E) vs. ""late"" (L) signaling network's topology in thse datasets. We also developed an adaptation of the DMBA-induced rat mammary tumor model and show that it represents E, L, and ""not"" (N) recurring tumors, molecular features of which are present in human breast tumors and cell lines. Mechanistically, our data implicate a ""rewiring"" (including epigenetic events) of the signaling from the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, and adaptations in cellular metabolism, as the molecular events that may enable cells to maintain, and later escape from, dormancy. Our central hypothesis is that dormancy reflects the growth arrest induced by endocrine therapies in both residual tumors (in-breast recurrences) and micro-metastases (distant recurrences), and that the signaling maintaining dormancy after systemic therapy ends is epigenetically regulated. Indeed, prolonged hormone therapy may well work by extending dormancy. Individual cells can emerge from dormancy as their metabolic capacity becomes sufficient to support both survival and replication, and the integrated balance between autophagy (prosurvival) and apoptosis (prodeath) signaling enables more cells in a tumor to proliferate and the tumor population size to grow. We propose an integrated, multidisciplinary research program that, if successful, will generate innovative insights into the molecular drivers of dormancy in ER+ breast cancers, develop new in silico signaling models, identify predictors of patient risk to experience a late recurrence, and explore mechanisms of dormancy with the longer term goal of discovering potentially novel therapeutic interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) comprise 70% of all newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers. ER+ breast tumors represent the breast cancer subtype most strongly associated with tumor dormancy, conferring upon these patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that can persist for decades after initial diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, very little is known abou the molecular drivers that determine the onset, maintenance, and emergence from dormancy. Our multidisciplinary team will apply state-of-the-art technologies to several unique, independent, human breast cancer data sets (including matched primary and recurrent tumors from the same individuals) and a rat mammary tumor model to address two fundamental aspects of dormancy; i.e., we will (i) accurately and robustly identify those breast cancer patients at greatest risk of experiencing a late recurrence (e 5 yrs after initial diagnosis) and (i) define the molecular events driving dormancy to help develop new treatment strategies that can be targeted to these patients.",Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology,8928084,U01CA184902,"['dimethylbenzanthracene ', ' DMBA ', ' Benz(a)anthracene, 7,12-dimethyl- ', ' 7,12-dimentylbenzanthracene ', '

"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer. The functionality of the software will substantially transcend limitations of current analysis of cancer images, and will open the way for more precise and effective surgical planning as well as for more specific diagnosis of cancer based on its imaging characteristics, eventually leading to individualized medicine.                ",Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer,8967740,U24CA189523,"['Atlases ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' tumors in the brain ', ' Brain Tumors ', ' Brain Neoplasia ', ' Brain Neoplasms ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dictionary ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational Activities ', ' Explosion ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Glioma ', ' neuroglia tumor ', ' neuroglia neoplasm ', ' glial-derived tumor ', ' Neuroglial Tumor ', ' Neuroglial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Tumor ', ' Glial Neoplasm ', ' Glial Cell Tumors ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Fiber ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Infiltration ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Transcend ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Informatics ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' Data ', ' ACRIN ', ' American College of Radiology Imaging Network ', ' computational analysis ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Physiologic Imaging ', ' Functional Imaging ', ' Slice ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' molecular imaging ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' imaging probe ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' image registration ', ' Information Technology ', ' Outcome ', ' cancer imaging ', ' Imaging technology ', ' open source ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' treatment response ', ' phenomics ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' precision medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' targeted treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' individualized medicine ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U24,2015,653458,0.2314439387154259
"Background parenchymal uptake (BPU) on molecular breast imaging as a novel breast cancer risk factor ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to establish a novel image-based breast cancer risk factor based on functional behavior of breast fibroglandular tissue that can improve risk stratification of women with mammographically dense breasts. Over 40% of screening-eligible women have mammographically dense breasts, which refers to a high amount of fibroglandular tissue relative to fat on a mammogram. These women are at elevated risk of developing breast cancer, based on a large body of evidence showing density as one of the strongest risk factors, and are increasingly encouraged to discuss their density-related risk with providers. Yet, the discriminatory accuracy of breast density is weak, limiting its usefulness in clinical risk prediction. We postulate that mammographic density does have importance in risk assessment, with the critical caveat that not all dense tissue confers equivalent risk. Because mammography creates an anatomic depiction of the breast, it is inherently unable to distinguish the known functional heterogeneity of breast fibroglandular tissue among women that likely has important implications in regards to breast cancer risk. We propose that functional behavior of fibroglandular tissue or level of background parenchymal uptake (BPU) that can be assessed on molecular breast imaging (MBI) exams allows for a non-invasive means for determining the subset of women with dense tissue who are at greatest risk of developing breast cancer. In Aim 1, we will establish a retrospective cohort study of 3300 women who had screening MBI performed at Mayo Clinic Rochester between the years 2004 - 2015. MBI exams, mammograms, and medical history information will be obtained; assessments of BPU and mammographic density from existing imaging will be performed; and incident breast cancers in the cohort will be identified via the Mayo Clinic tumor registry and mailed follow-up. In Aim 2, we will use this well-characterized cohort to examine the association of BPU (assessed both categorically and quantitatively) and breast cancer risk. Cox proportional-hazards regression will be employed in a multivariable model with adjustments for covariates, including mammographic density. An exploratory analysis of the interaction between BPU and mammographic density will also be performed using a Gradient Boosting Machine learning algorithm. We hypothesize that high BPU will be associated with increased cancer risk relative to low BPU, beyond the association observed between density and risk. We will also explore whether BPU stratifies the risk associated with dense breasts. This work is the first evaluation of BPU on MBI as a breast cancer risk factor and the first investigation into whether functional behavior of fibroglandular tissue can discriminate risk of mammographically dense tissue. For increasing numbers of women who are now undergoing MBI for supplemental breast screening, this additional risk information will be valuable in guiding clinical decisions regarding tailored screening and risk-reduction options.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Of women in the U.S. who are eligible for screening mammography, 43% or 27.5 million are estimated to have mammographically dense breasts - a factor strongly associated with increased breast cancer risk. Yet, mammographic density has limited discriminatory accuracy to be useful for risk assessment. We propose that assessment of the functional behavior of dense tissue, as imaged by a molecular breast imaging (MBI) exam, can identify the subset of women with dense breasts who are at the greatest risk of developing breast cancer, and therefore are most likely to benefit from increased surveillance or preventive risk-reduction options.            ",Background parenchymal uptake (BPU) on molecular breast imaging as a novel breast cancer risk factor,8956477,R21CA197752,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Behavior ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cells ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Epithelium ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hormones ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Masks ', ' Radiology-Nuclear Medicine ', ' Radiology / Radiation Biology / Nuclear Medicine ', ' Nuclear Medicine ', ' Atomic Medicine ', ' Discipline of Nuclear Medicine ', ' Play ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Lobular ', ' postmenopausal ', ' post-menopausal ', ' Postmenopausal Period ', ' Post-menopausal Period ', ' Post-Menopause ', ' Postmenopause ', ' Evaluation ', ' Relative Risks ', ' uptake ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Medical History ', ' Metabolic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Clinic ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' functional status ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' attenuation ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Appearance ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Preventive ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Stratification ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Low Dose Radiation ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' Molecular ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' tumor registry ', ' Population ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2015,138330,0.39458381888208993
"Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose that collagen features, such as alignment, fiber straightness and width, and other features of extracellular matrix composition can be used as an early biomarker of breast cancer. It is the goal of this proposal to determine the range of collagen structural features that characterize normal, benign and early disease, to determine how these features relate to mammographic density, and to identify the features that best predict risk, recurrence, and progression. This proposal leverages a diverse collaborative team that includes experts in imaging and understanding the tumor microenvironment, breast surgery, experts in population health and biostatistics, and an expert in proteomic analysis of the ECM. This team will analyze a set of patient cohorts to develop imaging and analysis of collagen structure and ECM composition as a potential early biomarker for breast cancer. Aims: 1) Characterize collagen features that define heterogeneity of the normal state. 2) Characterize collagen features in pre- and early breast cancer lesions. 3) Characterize the proteomics of biopsies representing benign, at risk, and invasive breast cancer. Significance: This project meets the goals of the RFA to develop and validate combined imaging and biomarker approaches to improve early cancer detection and the diagnosis of early-stage cancers. Our findings have the potential to reduce overdiagnosis and false positives and discern lethal from non-lethal disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The widespread adoption of screening mammography throughout the 1980s and 1990s led to a reduction in breast cancer mortality as more women were diagnosed at an earlier stage of disease and could be more successfully treated. Apart from their use in visualizing the tumor, mammograms are quantifiable based on the density of the signal in the image, which is based on the absorbance of x-rays by cells and the filamentous protein collagen. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and in the breast is present as a scaffolding network that supports the milk-secreting epithelial cells of this gland. In non-diseased breasts, the mammographic density is a function of the amount of collagen present, and is highly correlated to a 4-6 fold increased risk of developing breast cancer in the future. Mammographic density has been deemed so important that over a dozen states have recently passed legislation requiring physicians to inform patients of this value. However, the problem is that mammographic density does not predict survival once a tumor has been detected. Thus, although we have improved our detection of breast cancers, we do not have the ability to sort patients into groups where disease progresses from those that do not. Our current paradigm of treating everyone aggressively needs to change to a targeted plan of treating only those women at risk of future life-threatening disease. It is our hypothesis that it is not the overall macroscpic amount of collagen present, but rather the structure and organization of collagen at the local level which predicts cancer progression. We will examine tissue samples from a variety of non-diseased human patient cohorts, with the goal of discovering a biomarker for disease progression based on collagen structure. This will be done non-invasively by imaging slides that are already routinely prepared using a technique called second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy which selectively images collagen. We have advanced software which will measure the length, width, straightness, density and orientation of fibers that we can use to analyze tens of thousands of collagen fibers from dozens of images per sample. This high level of quantitation improves our statistical ability to discover the underlying biomarker from the noise. By understanding the normal non-diseased state, we can apply this knowledge to very early cancer stages in order to sort patients into aggressive and non-aggressive therapy groups. As a compliment to these studies, we will also determine the protein composition of the collagen matrix, as there are dozens of other proteins present. Preliminary data has shown changes in the makeup of proteins found in normal tissue compared to breast cancer, implying that the change in collagen structure is related to the underlying expression of proteins there. Through our proposed experiments, we will establish what a truly ""normal"" collagen matrix looks like in terms of structure and composition.            ",Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma,8985889,R01CA199996,"['Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Glycoproteins ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Menopause ', ' Microscopy ', ' Milk ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Needles ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Noise ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Risk ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Stains ', ' Time ', ' Tissue/Specimen Collection ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Normal Values ', ' Normal Range ', ' Tissue Banking ', ' base ', ' density ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' Collagen Fiber ', ' Fiber ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Staging ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' scaffolding ', ' scaffold ', ' Aspirate ', ' Aspirate substance ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' Image Guided Biopsy ', ' Stainings ', ' Staining method ', ' Width ', ' Hematoxylin and Eosin ', ' H and E ', ' Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method ', ' meetings ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cohort ', ' Mammary Carcinoma ', ' Breast Carcinoma ', ' Structure ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting -

"A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Critical clinical activities involve decision making. For both individual patients and for society at large, making good healthcare decisions is a paramount task. The objective of this research is to develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assit the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient.      Traditional clinical data are becoming increasingly available in electronic form. Unprecedentedly abundant genomic data are available to researchers as the results of advanced sequencing technologies such as next generation sequencing. Patient-specific genomic data are likely to become available for most patients in the foreseeable future. These sources of data provide significant opportunities for developing new generation clinical decision support systems that can achieve substantial progress over what is currently possible. However, the sheer magnitude of the number of variables in these data (often in the millions) presents formidable computational and modeling challenges. Also, integrating the heterogeneous information in multiple clinical datasets and genomic datasets presents an arduous challenge.      Breast cancer is the commonest cancer among women. Various breast cancer subtypes have been defined which, along with tumor stage, predict response to therapy and survival, albeit imperfectly. For example, HER2-amplified breast cancer is a subtype with poor prognosis, and therapy with an antibody to HER2 (Herceptin) has vastly improved the survival of such patients. Although Herceptin is used in the therapy of all patients with HER2-amplified tumors, only some respond. Also, it is expensive and can cause cardiac toxicity. So, it is important to give it only o patients benefiting from it. Studies show thousands of genes are associated with subtype and prognosis of breast cancer, and particular allele combinations may usefully guide the selection of effective treatment. The proposed system will amass all this genomic information and combine it with clinical information and therefore holds promise to provide accurate classification and treatment choices.      We will build the knowledge base of the proposed system using the following sources: 1) The Medical Archival Systems at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center; 2) The Lynn Sage Database used by the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center at Northwestern Memorial Hospital; 3) The breast cancer data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas project; and 4) Dream 7 Breast Cancer Challenge Data. The proposed system will build on previous results of the investigators in using Bayesian Network to learn from high-dimensional data sets. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record, including NIH funding, publications in biomedical informatics and artificial intelligence, and experience developing cutting-edge decision support systems. Even a modest improvement in the efficacy of clinical decision making has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. This project will develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assist the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient. We call this system A Clinical Decision Support System for Making Personalized Assessments and Recommendations Concerning Breast Cancer Patients (DPAC).",A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System,8856659,R01LM011663,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Antibodies ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' Computer Programs and Programming ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' dreaming ', ' Dreams ', ' Electronics ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Hospitals ', ' Learning ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' neu Genes ', ' erbb2 [{C0242957}] ', ' erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 Proto-Oncogenes ', ' c-erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 ', ' TKR1 ', ' Human EGF Receptor 2 Gene ', ' HER2/neu ', ' HER2 Genes ', ' HER2 ', ' HER/2 ', ' HER-2 Genes ', ' HER-2 ', ' HER -2 ', ' ERBB2 ', ' ERBB2 gene ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Herceptin ', ' Roche brand of trastuzumab ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' novel ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' response ', ' Cardiac Toxicity ', ' Cardiotoxicity ', ' Genomics ', ' T-Stage ', ' Tumor stage ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Process ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' clinical care ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,452719,0.28459311149826305
"Mammographic Density and Tissue Asymmetry Based Breast Cancer Risk Stratification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite being one of the leading cancers in women, breast cancer detection rates in a repeat screened population are quite low (i.e., 3 to 5 cancers detected per 1000 examinations). Screening for the early detection of breast cancer has been controversial from the start, but recent events highlight the need to develop and optimize individualized screening regimens by identifying women who are at higher than average risk of developing breast cancer in the near future, namely within five years. Establishing optimal individualized screening regimens that facilitate women to be screened at different intervals and/or with different imaging methods based on their assigned risk group will not only increase sensitivity, resulting in the detection of earlier cancers, but also reduce overall cost and anxiet associated with screening programs. Breast cancer risk assessment has been studied for many years; however, due to reasonably low positive predictive values there are no existing risk models that are universally accepted in routine clinical practice, in particular as related to screening and diagnosis. There is no doubt that a breast cancer risk model with high discriminatory power will enable an increase in efficiency, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of screening paradigms. We propose to develop and test an innovative risk predictor that is based primarily on computed image features representing bilateral mammographic tissue density asymmetry between left and right breasts. As important, we will develop and test this predictor using mammograms acquired prior to any depiction of a highly suspicious abnormality leading to a biopsy and/or a verification of cancer. To achieve our objectives we will assemble a large and diverse image database of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images with sequentially available images and related clinical information. The database will include three groups of cases, namely (1) positive cases that were verified to have cancer one to six years after the first available negative FFDM examination, (2) screening negative cases that have not been recalled during the period of interest, and (3) recalled and/or biopsied cases due to suspicious mammographic findings, but later proven to be negative or benign. Computed bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry features will be used to develop the new risk predictor. In addition to evaluating the overall classification performance on the entire database, we will investigate the reproducibility of the predictor's results and the relationship between predictor's classification performance and the time lag between a negative FFDM in question and the first recall due to the actual detection of a highly suspicious finding leading to a biopsy and/or a confirmed cancer. We will also assess the impact, if any, of several other commonly used risk factors (i.e., age, family history, and breast density BIRADS) on predictor's performance. A bootstrapping method will be used to compute predictor's performance levels and 95% confidence intervals. By incorporating this risk predictor with other existing risk models, we will investigate the feasibility of improving discriminatory power in predicting risk of individual women developing breast cancer in near-term (<5 years). This application aims to develop and test an innovative breast cancer risk predictor based primarily (but not solely) on bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry as measured from a single negative mammography examination. We aim to identify women who are at high and/or low risk of developing breast cancer during the time period of 1 to 5 years following a negative examination. This information could be used for developing a highly discriminative model of the breast-cancer risk that could be then used for designing optimal individualized screening plans.",Mammographic Density and Tissue Asymmetry Based Breast Cancer Risk Stratification,8826571,R01CA160205,"['Age ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Left ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Lesion ', ' Individual ', ' Bilateral ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' Staging ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' cancer risk ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Stratification ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Genetic Algorithm ', ' Genetic Programming ', ' Scheme ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' Regimen ', ' young woman ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2015,226815,0.31103526177522783
"Informatics Techniques to Optimize Mammography for Aging Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop, integrate, and evaluate novel informatics techniques to optimize the mammographic diagnosis of breast cancer in aging women. Women over age 65 who develop breast cancers have greater death rates and poorer outcomes. These women also bear the heaviest burden of ""overdiagnosis"" a phenomenon in which screening identifies cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death. These sobering statistics are made more urgent by the realization that the number of women > 65 is projected to more than double (from 20-40 million) between 2000 and 2050. In this research program, we propose to develop tools that will improve the early diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, minimize unnecessary invasive procedures (decrease false positives) and concomitantly address overdiagnosis. Specifically we aim to 1) develop a probabilistic computer model trained by a novel machine learning algorithm, Prediction using Logical Uplift Modeling (PLUM), that tailors breast cancer risk estimations to aging women; 2) use a decision analytic model to determine the optimal breast biopsy threshold using an important pathologic prognostic indicator, cytologic grade in the context of age, and 3) use comparative effectiveness analysis to determine how these personalized risk prediction strategies and optimal thresholds for action will improve on current breast cancer screening policies in women > 65. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical, engineering, and computer science literature) of innovative research that integrates state-of-the-art informatics algorithms to improve breast cancer diagnosis. Using prior experience and infrastructure, we are building a completely new machine learning algorithm, PLUM, which uses 1) inductive logic programming (ILP) to accurately learn from multi-relational data; 2) uplift modeling that uses age as a partition, and 3) rule incorporation into our probabilistic model for accurate risk prediction. We necessarily use a uniquely rich clinical data, a deep understanding of disease processes, and creative integration of these computational tools. New preliminary data presented in this resubmission foreshadow scientific success and clinical translation. If supported, this project will prove that risk prediction and decision analytic tools can accurately assess breast cancer risk, determine an optimal, personalized biopsy threshold, and provide a superior breast cancer screening policy than is currently employed in the US for women over age 65.          Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women over the age of 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized software tools that predict breast cancer risk and prognosis are needed to avoid late diagnosis, morbidity and mortality, as well as minimize false positives and overdiagnosis (cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death). Our multidisciplinary team of breast cancer physicians/experts, engineers, and computer scientists propose to build models that can predict breast cancer risk, determine the optimal management of mammography findings based on this risk, and the population impact of these tools for women over 65 in the US.

"Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K24 proposal combines mentoring in patient oriented cancer control research; research to translate evidence-based shared decision-support for screening mammography to the clinic; and career development in Implementation Science. The PI, Dr. Elizabeth Burnside, has been an influential mentor throughout her career at the University of Wisconsin (UW), fostered by leadership positions like her role as the co-lead of the Cancer Control Program in the UW NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Her mentoring and research both promote team science, which unites medical and ""translational"" disciplines like informatics, engineering, and population health, all areas for which she has expertise and departmental affiliate appointments. This award would carve out the necessary time for her to build a platform on which to formalize her mentoring approach and a curriculum to support a cadre of physician/scientists developing decision support tools aimed for clinical translation. This proposal takes advantage of a successful Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) funded at UW in 2006, committed to mentoring, patient oriented team science, and translational research. The aims included in this proposal are closely aligned with the UW CTSA -KL2 and other institutional training grants and fully leverage the rich mentoring and career development resources.  The patient oriented scientific aims proposed arise from healthcare shortfalls that she, a radiologist practicing in breast imaging, sees every day in clinic. They buid on her NCI funded R01 which asks the question: How can decision support in the clinic help healthcare providers optimize breast cancer screening and diagnosis in aging women? Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women = 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized strategies are needed to decrease morbidity and mortality, while minimizing harms (false positives and overdiagnosis-the detection of cancer that would not go on to cause symptoms or death). Though validated decision aids currently exist, immense opportunities still remain: personalization, integration in the clinical workflow, and implementation with high fidelity; all goals of this proposal. Personalized decision support tools will only be useful if they are thoughtfully designed and rigorously implemented.  Both her scientific aims and her career development plans integrate the new discipline of Implemenation Science. These methodologies will enable her to translate advances into an EMR-embedded decision tool for improved breast cancer screening decision-making for women = 65 and their physicians. Innovation is substantial; creating a tool that incorporates national simulation models to accurately convey outcomes that is integrated into the EMR has not been done. This award will enable Dr. Burnside to become an influential mentor of clinician-scientists using implementation science to advance personalized decision support into the clinic.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to build a mentorship program for clinicians who are developing tools that use a patient's unique characteristics to help make optimal health care decisions. The proposed research exemplifies this important goal by using the newest scientific techniques to develop and test a personalized decision tool to help women age 65 or over decide (with their physician) whether to undergo breast cancer screening. By combining mentoring, research, and new scientific methodologies, this plan will powerfully translate the science of personalized prediction to patients to help make decisions that are right for them.            ",Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis,8869631,K24CA194251,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Award ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Influentials ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Planning Technic ', ' Planning Methodology ', ' Planning Techniques ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychologist ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Decision Aid ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' cancer risk ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' cancer care ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' CISNET ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' implementation science ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' surveillance network ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K24,2015,146019,0.27588535688574367
"Machine Learning Comparison of Brain Anatomy in Cancer and Alzheimer's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties with cognitive skills such as memory, thinking and attention are very common after breast cancer chemotherapy. These cognitive difficulties have been associated with chemotherapy-related injury to several brain regions, particularly those regions that also tend to be affected by brain aging. There is concern that chemotherapy may accelerate brain aging and increase patients' risk for Alzheimer's disease. Certain previous studies support this concern while others do not and therefore the effect of breast cancer chemotherapy on risk for Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. The proposed research will compare brain anatomy of breast cancer survivors to that of women who later developed Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, we will determine a pattern of brain anatomy that indicates the probability of developing Alzheimer's disease. This pattern, or classifier, will be determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that were obtained for approximately 100 women with Alzheimer's disease compared to MRI scans from a group of approximately 100 healthy, unaffected women. We will then apply the classifier to MRI scans from 108 breast cancer survivors, 67 who received chemotherapy treatment and 41 who did not. Using the machine learning classifier, we will calculate a score for each breast cancer survivor that indicates her probability of developing Alzheimer's disease based on her brain anatomy. We believe that probability scores will be significantly higher in the chemotherapy group compared to the no-chemotherapy group. We will also explore possible predictors of probability score such as demographic, disease, genetic and treatment factors. This project has the potential to improve our ability to identify patients at risk for persistent and/or progressive chemotherapy-related brain injury using a simple, non-invasive five minute MRI scan. This information could potentially inform treatment decision-making and prioritize patients for early intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of women who receive chemotherapy for breast cancer will experience long- term problems with brain function, such as thinking, memory and attention that reduce quality of life and extend disease-related disability. The proposed study aims to improve our understanding regarding the brain changes that occur following breast cancer chemotherapy. This research is highly relevant to breast cancer, one of the most common public health problems, affecting 1 in 8 women.",Machine Learning Comparison of Brain Anatomy in Cancer and Alzheimer's Disease,9031091,R03CA191559,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cognition ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Laboratories ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' apolipoprotein E-4 ', ' apolipoprotein E4 ', ' apoE4 ', ' apoE-4 ', ' apo epsilon4 ', ' apo E4 ', ' apo E-4 ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Early Intervention ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Host Factor Protein ', ' Host Factor ', ' Integration Host Factors ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cancer chemotherapy ', ' Quimioterapia ', ' Combination Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy, Cancer, General ', ' Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy Protocol ', ' Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure ', ' Diffuse Brain Injury ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Treatment Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Brain region ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Derivation ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment ', ' chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment ', ' chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment ', ' chemo brain ', ' chemobrain ', ' cognitive reserve ', ' Outcome ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' neuropsychological ', ' chemotherapy ', ' aging brain ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' Patient risk ', ' cognitive skill ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer survivor ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' individual patient ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R03,2016,80000,0.2031629751593532
"A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Critical clinical activities involve decision making. For both individual patients and for society at large, making good healthcare decisions is a paramount task. The objective of this research is to develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assit the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient.      Traditional clinical data are becoming increasingly available in electronic form. Unprecedentedly abundant genomic data are available to researchers as the results of advanced sequencing technologies such as next generation sequencing. Patient-specific genomic data are likely to become available for most patients in the foreseeable future. These sources of data provide significant opportunities for developing new generation clinical decision support systems that can achieve substantial progress over what is currently possible. However, the sheer magnitude of the number of variables in these data (often in the millions) presents formidable computational and modeling challenges. Also, integrating the heterogeneous information in multiple clinical datasets and genomic datasets presents an arduous challenge.      Breast cancer is the commonest cancer among women. Various breast cancer subtypes have been defined which, along with tumor stage, predict response to therapy and survival, albeit imperfectly. For example, HER2-amplified breast cancer is a subtype with poor prognosis, and therapy with an antibody to HER2 (Herceptin) has vastly improved the survival of such patients. Although Herceptin is used in the therapy of all patients with HER2-amplified tumors, only some respond. Also, it is expensive and can cause cardiac toxicity. So, it is important to give it only o patients benefiting from it. Studies show thousands of genes are associated with subtype and prognosis of breast cancer, and particular allele combinations may usefully guide the selection of effective treatment. The proposed system will amass all this genomic information and combine it with clinical information and therefore holds promise to provide accurate classification and treatment choices.      We will build the knowledge base of the proposed system using the following sources: 1) The Medical Archival Systems at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center; 2) The Lynn Sage Database used by the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center at Northwestern Memorial Hospital; 3) The breast cancer data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas project; and 4) Dream 7 Breast Cancer Challenge Data. The proposed system will build on previous results of the investigators in using Bayesian Network to learn from high-dimensional data sets. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record, including NIH funding, publications in biomedical informatics and artificial intelligence, and experience developing cutting-edge decision support systems. Even a modest improvement in the efficacy of clinical decision making has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. This project will develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assist the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient.

"Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis PROJECT SUMMARY  The advent of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) or “3D mammography” brings promise of improved sensitivity and specificity. Even as DBT undergoes rapid clinical adoption, this new imaging modality poses new challenges to radiologists due to many differences in image appearance compared to conventional mammography. Recent studies and clinical experience show the urgent need for improved training in DBT. These changes necessitate dedicated training for both radiology residents and board-certified radiologists. The currently accepted training paradigm (i.e., the “one size fits all” approach) cannot effectively accommodate the individual needs of each radiologist-in-training. We propose to address this shortcoming.  This project seeks to develop a new paradigm of adaptive, computer-enhanced training in the interpretation of DBT. Using predictive algorithms similar to the recommendation systems of companies like Amazon and Netflix, our system will create a training environment tailored to the needs of each individual radiologist. We have shown that the radiologists-in-training do not make errors in a random manner; instead their error making demonstrates specific patterns. Even more importantly, those errors can be predicted from each individual’s previous interpretations. We propose to use machine learning-based user modeling as well as collaborative filtering algorithms to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each individual. Then, we will adapt the training protocol to the individual needs of the trainee in order to accelerate the training and improve his/her diagnostic skills in the areas that need improvement. The aims are: (1) develop user models that predict the difficulty of a DBT case based its image features and trainee performance, (2) implement an educational system that presents training cases that focus on the unique needs of each individual, and (3) conduct a reader study to validate the improved effectiveness of the proposed adaptive system.  This has work has the following key innovations. We propose the first ever computer-aided education system for residents and radiologists that is adaptive and individualized. We leverage cutting edge concepts from the fields of user modeling and collaborative filtering, which our lab has introduced to the field of medical imaging. This work addresses training limitations for the newly adopted modality of DBT.  This research has very high clinical significance: Improving training in the interpretation of breast images will ensure the greatest benefit of breast cancer screening. The proposed work, while developing a fully functional DBT education system, will contribute to the foundation for a more general, new paradigm of improved individualized education that extends to other image interpretation tasks and imaging modalities. This work is a collaboration between computer vision and machine learning experts, breast imaging radiologists, director of Radiology residency, a biostatistician, and a human factors expert. Our technology will be disseminated through a partnership with IMAIOS, a leading provider of online radiology education. Digital breast tomosynthesis is becoming a standard practice in breast cancer screening and there is a pressing need for effective education in this new modality. In this study we propose to develop a computer system for education in digital breast tomosynthesis that adapts itself to each trainee and to find an individualized training protocol that fits best the trainee’s needs. Such system could improve dramatically the time efficiency of training in digital breast tomosynthesis images and improve diagnostic performance of the trainees. This is likely to improve the overall effectiveness of breast cancer screening and, given high importance of breast cancer screening, decrease mortality rate of the disease.",Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis,9177536,R01EB021360,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breast ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Computers ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' continuing medical education ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Hand ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Residencies ', ' Rest ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' case-based ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' clinical practice ', ' Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,389204,0.2766951105647728
"Mechano-Visual Phenotyping of Cancer: From Onset Through Disease Progression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year. This translates to about 1560 deaths per day attributed to cancer - overall, in the US, 1 in every 4 deaths is attributed to cancer. In the US, cancer is the second most common cause of death only next to deaths due to heart disease. Future progress in several key areas of cancer research and drug discovery will rely upon the capacity of investigators to reliably detect, characterize and track subtle changes that occur in the tumor environment during the transformation from the benign to cancerous state. The central objective of this grant proposal is to design, develop and evaluate computational and imaging tools, which provide insight regarding the mechanical and morphological changes that occur starting with the onset of a malignancy and follow those changes throughout the course of disease progression using a representative ensemble of cancer tissue specimens from breast cancer cases. These new technologies will facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic and prognostic clues, which are not apparent using traditional methods of assessment.  The overarching objectives of the proposed project are: 1) to investigate changes in the mechanical characteristics of sampled tissues through accurate non-linear finite element modeling based on the experimentally captured atomic force microscopy (AFM) data, 2) to increase the sampling throughput to allow automated assessment of multiple regions of interest, simultaneously, using an array of micro force sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and 3) to compare the mechanical changes, expression signatures, and spatial distribution of biomarkers in the normal tissue samples with those collected at the onset of malignancy and throughout the primary stages of disease progression for breast cancer cases. Based on successful completion of these aims, we will design, develop and evaluate a reliable means for providing multimodal decision support for performing automated, higher-throughput characterization of specimens. Finally, our team will deploy, test and optimize the updated suite of computational and modeling tools at strategic adopter sites (Emory University and University of Pennsylvania - see letters of support).  To accomplish this, we have assembled an excellent team of engineers and clinicians from the University Of Maryland, College Park and The Cancer Institute of New Jersey for this extremely important NIH project.

"Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk Project Summary/Abstract Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women at the age of 40 and older. Mammography has been used as a low-cost screening tool for breast cancer. The recent controversy on breast cancer screening recommendations has increased public awareness and interests for informed counseling of screening and health care options based on individualized estimates of risk. The goal of this proposed project is to develop a computerized image-based biomarker to assess the breast cancer risk of individual patients in the screening population. The innovation of our approach lies in the fact that the quantitative breast parenchyma descriptor (q-BPD) will be designed to take into account not only the percentage of dense tissue (PD) but also the stromal and epithelial structural pattern of an individual's breast that is complementary to, rather than a surrogate of, the breast density. The q-BPD is obtained by a joint analysis of the complexity of the parenchymal distribution pattern (mammographic parenchymal pattern, MPP) and the amount of dense tissue (PD) as they are imaged on full-field digital mammograms (FFDMs). We hypothesize that the proposed q-BPD is an independent risk factor for breast cancer and will have a stronger predictive power than previous approaches such as PD or BI-RADS density categories alone. To test the hypothesis, we have the following specific aims: (1) to collect a matched case-control data set of 500 breast cancer cases and 2000 matched controls with 5 years of prior FFDMs (prior to cancer diagnosis for the case group). We will split the entire data set into independent subsets for training and validation; (2) to design a q- BPD by using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to maximize the discriminatory power at the personal level; (3) to investigate the association of developed q-BPD with breast cancer risk in comparison with commonly used density descriptors, such as radiologist's estimates of BI-RADS density categories and interactive PD on FFDMs by case-control studies and statistical analyses, taking into account other confounding risk factors. When fully developed, the automated q-BPD can be incorporated as a part of routine breast cancer screening. It will not only be useful for breast cancer risk prediction for individual patients but also for monitoring of risk regression or progression over time due to treatment or other factors. The new risk prediction tool is expected to play a key role in personalized breast cancer screening for women at different risk levels, thereby reducing health care costs while benefiting high risk women. The success of this project will lay the foundation for future large-scale clinica trials to address the limitations and investigate the clinical utilities of the proposed q-BPD for breast cancer risk prediction. Key Words: quantitative breast parenchyma analysis, image-based biomarker, breast cancer risk prediction, full-field digital mammogram (FFDM) PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed quantitative descriptor of breast parenchyma (q-BPD) can serve as a cost-effective biomarker to assist in stratification of screening strategy for individuals, follow-up, risk management, and monitoring of preventive treatment of high-risk women or interventional treatment of breast cancer patients, as well as for research and development of new treatment regimens.

"Informatics Techniques to Optimize Mammography for Aging Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop, integrate, and evaluate novel informatics techniques to optimize the mammographic diagnosis of breast cancer in aging women. Women over age 65 who develop breast cancers have greater death rates and poorer outcomes. These women also bear the heaviest burden of ""overdiagnosis"" a phenomenon in which screening identifies cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death. These sobering statistics are made more urgent by the realization that the number of women > 65 is projected to more than double (from 20-40 million) between 2000 and 2050. In this research program, we propose to develop tools that will improve the early diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, minimize unnecessary invasive procedures (decrease false positives) and concomitantly address overdiagnosis. Specifically we aim to 1) develop a probabilistic computer model trained by a novel machine learning algorithm, Prediction using Logical Uplift Modeling (PLUM), that tailors breast cancer risk estimations to aging women; 2) use a decision analytic model to determine the optimal breast biopsy threshold using an important pathologic prognostic indicator, cytologic grade in the context of age, and 3) use comparative effectiveness analysis to determine how these personalized risk prediction strategies and optimal thresholds for action will improve on current breast cancer screening policies in women > 65. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical, engineering, and computer science literature) of innovative research that integrates state-of-the-art informatics algorithms to improve breast cancer diagnosis. Using prior experience and infrastructure, we are building a completely new machine learning algorithm, PLUM, which uses 1) inductive logic programming (ILP) to accurately learn from multi-relational data; 2) uplift modeling that uses age as a partition, and 3) rule incorporation into our probabilistic model for accurate risk prediction. We necessarily use a uniquely rich clinical data, a deep understanding of disease processes, and creative integration of these computational tools. New preliminary data presented in this resubmission foreshadow scientific success and clinical translation. If supported, this project will prove that risk prediction and decision analytic tools can accurately assess breast cancer risk, determine an optimal, personalized biopsy threshold, and provide a superior breast cancer screening policy than is currently employed in the US for women over age 65. Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women over the age of 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized software tools that predict breast cancer risk and prognosis are needed to avoid late diagnosis, morbidity and mortality, as well as minimize false positives and overdiagnosis (cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death). Our multidisciplinary team of breast cancer physicians/experts, engineers, and computer scientists propose to build models that can predict breast cancer risk, determine the optimal management of mammography findings based on this risk, and the population impact of these tools for women over 65 in the US.",Informatics Techniques to Optimize Mammography for Aging Populations,9057470,R01CA165229,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' mammary disorder ', ' Breast Disorder ', ' Breast Diseases ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' DCIS ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computers ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Learning ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Literature ', ' Logic ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Background parenchymal uptake (BPU) on molecular breast imaging as a novel breast cancer risk factor ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to establish a novel image-based breast cancer risk factor based on functional behavior of breast fibroglandular tissue that can improve risk stratification of women with mammographically dense breasts. Over 40% of screening-eligible women have mammographically dense breasts, which refers to a high amount of fibroglandular tissue relative to fat on a mammogram. These women are at elevated risk of developing breast cancer, based on a large body of evidence showing density as one of the strongest risk factors, and are increasingly encouraged to discuss their density-related risk with providers. Yet, the discriminatory accuracy of breast density is weak, limiting its usefulness in clinical risk prediction. We postulate that mammographic density does have importance in risk assessment, with the critical caveat that not all dense tissue confers equivalent risk. Because mammography creates an anatomic depiction of the breast, it is inherently unable to distinguish the known functional heterogeneity of breast fibroglandular tissue among women that likely has important implications in regards to breast cancer risk. We propose that functional behavior of fibroglandular tissue or level of background parenchymal uptake (BPU) that can be assessed on molecular breast imaging (MBI) exams allows for a non-invasive means for determining the subset of women with dense tissue who are at greatest risk of developing breast cancer. In Aim 1, we will establish a retrospective cohort study of 3300 women who had screening MBI performed at Mayo Clinic Rochester between the years 2004 - 2015. MBI exams, mammograms, and medical history information will be obtained; assessments of BPU and mammographic density from existing imaging will be performed; and incident breast cancers in the cohort will be identified via the Mayo Clinic tumor registry and mailed follow-up. In Aim 2, we will use this well-characterized cohort to examine the association of BPU (assessed both categorically and quantitatively) and breast cancer risk. Cox proportional-hazards regression will be employed in a multivariable model with adjustments for covariates, including mammographic density. An exploratory analysis of the interaction between BPU and mammographic density will also be performed using a Gradient Boosting Machine learning algorithm. We hypothesize that high BPU will be associated with increased cancer risk relative to low BPU, beyond the association observed between density and risk. We will also explore whether BPU stratifies the risk associated with dense breasts. This work is the first evaluation of BPU on MBI as a breast cancer risk factor and the first investigation into whether functional behavior of fibroglandular tissue can discriminate risk of mammographically dense tissue. For increasing numbers of women who are now undergoing MBI for supplemental breast screening, this additional risk information will be valuable in guiding clinical decisions regarding tailored screening and risk-reduction options. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Of women in the U.S. who are eligible for screening mammography, 43% or 27.5 million are estimated to have mammographically dense breasts - a factor strongly associated with increased breast cancer risk. Yet, mammographic density has limited discriminatory accuracy to be useful for risk assessment. We propose that assessment of the functional behavior of dense tissue, as imaged by a molecular breast imaging (MBI) exam, can identify the subset of women with dense breasts who are at the greatest risk of developing breast cancer, and therefore are most likely to benefit from increased surveillance or preventive risk-reduction options.",Background parenchymal uptake (BPU) on molecular breast imaging as a novel breast cancer risk factor,9139431,R21CA197752,"['Algorithms ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Behavior ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Epithelium ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Masks ', ' Radiology-Nuclear Medicine ', ' Radiology / Radiation Biology / Nuclear Medicine ', ' Nuclear Medicine ', ' Atomic Medicine ', ' Discipline of Nuclear Medicine ', ' Play ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Lobular ', ' postmenopausal ', ' post-menopausal ', ' Postmenopausal Period ', ' Post-menopausal Period ', ' Post-Menopause ', ' Postmenopause ', ' Evaluation ', ' Relative Risks ', ' uptake ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Medical History ', ' Metabolic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Clinic ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' functional status ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' attenuation ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Appearance ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Preventive ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Stratification ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Low Dose Radiation ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' Molecular ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' tumor registry ', ' Population ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' Hormone use ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2016,242078,0.39458381888208993
"Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and is characteristically an aggressive cancer, especially in a metastatic setting. Approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers are TNBC. In spite of recent improvements in TNBC treatment, the lack of known specific therapeutic targets and the heterogeneous response to chemotherapy make it difficult to attack TNBC and obtain a consistent outcome and meaningful benefit. Recently, cisplatin chemotherapy has regained interest based on growing evidence on achieving better outcome from preclinical and clinical data. However, many TNBC patients are not responding to the treatment; and there is no clinical practical way to identify in which individuals' cisplatin chemotherapy will be effective t avoid unnecessary toxicity and cost of healthcare.         The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, for identifying novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in TNBC more accurately and efficiently from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The recent discovery of the p63/p73 expression, p53 mutation and measurements of DNA repair status effects on the sensitivity to cisplatin in TNBC patients has indicated the existence of cisplatin response predictors and the need for further investigation. In this study, we will develo a novel sequence-based copy number variation (CNV) detection tool, using signal processing techniques; and a novel supervised integrative analysis tool, based on Bayesian network analysis which integrates CNV, point mutation and gene expression data. We will hone and validate the innovative methods and tools on publically available data such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Then by collaborating with oncologists and pathologists from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and using the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center DNA Resource Core services, we will generate novel DNA sequence and RNA- seq datasets on responsive and non-responsive TNBC tumor samples from an existing clinical trial, which was designed to study preoperative cisplatin in early-stage breast cancer. By applying the proposed computational framework we will shed unprecedented light on potential predictors of TNBC response to cisplatin therapy that can help guide biomarker selection. We will verify the candidate biomarkers through gene ontology and pathway analyses. In addition, we will analyze TCGA data to determine the prevalence of these candidate biomarkers in TNBC. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, to more accurately and efficiently identify novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from next-generation sequencing data. Successful completion of this proposal will result in two important public health impacts: (1) Candidate ""response"" biomarkers of cisplatin chemotherapy responsive TNBCs, and (2) A computational approach supporting personalized medicine for TNBC. Furthermore, once established, this framework can be extended to the detection of biomarkers in other tumor types, and can contribute to improving the drug development process and the effectiveness of

"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer.

"Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose that collagen features, such as alignment, fiber straightness and width, and other features of extracellular matrix composition can be used as an early biomarker of breast cancer. It is the goal of this proposal to determine the range of collagen structural features that characterize normal, benign and early disease, to determine how these features relate to mammographic density, and to identify the features that best predict risk, recurrence, and progression. This proposal leverages a diverse collaborative team that includes experts in imaging and understanding the tumor microenvironment, breast surgery, experts in population health and biostatistics, and an expert in proteomic analysis of the ECM. This team will analyze a set of patient cohorts to develop imaging and analysis of collagen structure and ECM composition as a potential early biomarker for breast cancer. Aims: 1) Characterize collagen features that define heterogeneity of the normal state. 2) Characterize collagen features in pre- and early breast cancer lesions. 3) Characterize the proteomics of biopsies representing benign, at risk, and invasive breast cancer. Significance: This project meets the goals of the RFA to develop and validate combined imaging and biomarker approaches to improve early cancer detection and the diagnosis of early-stage cancers. Our findings have the potential to reduce overdiagnosis and false positives and discern lethal from non-lethal disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The widespread adoption of screening mammography throughout the 1980s and 1990s led to a reduction in breast cancer mortality as more women were diagnosed at an earlier stage of disease and could be more successfully treated. Apart from their use in visualizing the tumor, mammograms are quantifiable based on the density of the signal in the image, which is based on the absorbance of x-rays by cells and the filamentous protein collagen. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and in the breast is present as a scaffolding network that supports the milk-secreting epithelial cells of this gland. In non-diseased breasts, the mammographic density is a function of the amount of collagen present, and is highly correlated to a 4-6 fold increased risk of developing breast cancer in the future. Mammographic density has been deemed so important that over a dozen states have recently passed legislation requiring physicians to inform patients of this value. However, the problem is that mammographic density does not predict survival once a tumor has been detected. Thus, although we have improved our detection of breast cancers, we do not have the ability to sort patients into groups where disease progresses from those that do not. Our current paradigm of treating everyone aggressively needs to change to a targeted plan of treating only those women at risk of future life-threatening disease. It is our hypothesis that it is not the overall macroscpic amount of collagen present, but rather the structure and organization of collagen at the local level which predicts cancer progression. We will examine tissue samples from a variety of non-diseased human patient cohorts, with the goal of discovering a biomarker for disease progression based on collagen structure. This will be done non-invasively by imaging slides that are already routinely prepared using a technique called second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy which selectively images collagen. We have advanced software which will measure the length, width, straightness, density and orientation of fibers that we can use to analyze tens of thousands of collagen fibers from dozens of images per sample. This high level of quantitation improves our statistical ability to discover the underlying biomarker from the noise. By understanding the normal non-diseased state, we can apply this knowledge to very early cancer stages in order to sort patients into aggressive and non-aggressive therapy groups. As a compliment to these studies, we will also determine the protein composition of the collagen matrix, as there are dozens of other proteins present.

"Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) tend to be less responsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy than ER-negative breast cancers; advanced ER+ breast cancer remains largely incurable. Moreover, this breast cancer subtype frequently exhibits marked dormancy, conferring upon patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that persists for decades after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Why ER+ breast is the most strongly associated with dormancy is unknown and represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Since 70% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are ER+ but ~50% of these eventually recur, many doing so years after cessation of an otherwise apparently successful initial intervention, significance of the dormant phenotype is clear. Using transcriptome data from pretreatment tumors from women with ER+ breast cancer who were subsequently treated with tamoxifen (TAM) as their only systemic therapy, we derived an initial molecular classifier that robustly separates early (d 3 yrs) from late (e 5 yrs; emergence from dormancy) distant recurrences in both training and independent datasets. We then identified novel features of the ""early"" (E) vs. ""late"" (L) signaling network's topology in thse datasets. We also developed an adaptation of the DMBA-induced rat mammary tumor model and show that it represents E, L, and ""not"" (N) recurring tumors, molecular features of which are present in human breast tumors and cell lines. Mechanistically, our data implicate a ""rewiring"" (including epigenetic events) of the signaling from the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, and adaptations in cellular metabolism, as the molecular events that may enable cells to maintain, and later escape from, dormancy. Our central hypothesis is that dormancy reflects the growth arrest induced by endocrine therapies in both residual tumors (in-breast recurrences) and micro-metastases (distant recurrences), and that the signaling maintaining dormancy after systemic therapy ends is epigenetically regulated. Indeed, prolonged hormone therapy may well work by extending dormancy. Individual cells can emerge from dormancy as their metabolic capacity becomes sufficient to support both survival and replication, and the integrated balance between autophagy (prosurvival) and apoptosis (prodeath) signaling enables more cells in a tumor to proliferate and the tumor population size to grow. We propose an integrated, multidisciplinary research program that, if successful, will generate innovative insights into the molecular drivers of dormancy in ER+ breast cancers, develop new in silico signaling models, identify predictors of patient risk to experience a late recurrence, and explore mechanisms of dormancy with the longer term goal of discovering potentially novel therapeutic interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) comprise 70% of all newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers. ER+ breast tumors represent the breast cancer subtype most strongly associated with tumor dormancy, conferring upon these patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that can persist for decades after initial diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, very little is known abou the molecular drivers that determine the onset, maintenance, and emergence from dormancy. Our multidisciplinary team will apply state-of-the-art technologies to several unique, independent, human breast cancer data sets (including matched primary and recurrent tumors from the same individuals) and a rat mammary tumor model to address two fundamental aspects of dormancy; i.e., we will (i) accurately and robustly identify those breast cancer patients at greatest risk of experiencing a late recurrence (e 5 yrs after initial diagnosis) and (i) define the molecular events driving dormancy to help develop new treatment strategies that can be targeted to these patients.",Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology,9136773,U01CA184902,"['dimethylbenz(a)anthracene ', ' DMBA ', ' dimethylbenzanthracene ', ' Malignant Adenoma ', ' Adenocarcinoma ', '

"Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K24 proposal combines mentoring in patient oriented cancer control research; research to translate evidence-based shared decision-support for screening mammography to the clinic; and career development in Implementation Science. The PI, Dr. Elizabeth Burnside, has been an influential mentor throughout her career at the University of Wisconsin (UW), fostered by leadership positions like her role as the co-lead of the Cancer Control Program in the UW NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Her mentoring and research both promote team science, which unites medical and ""translational"" disciplines like informatics, engineering, and population health, all areas for which she has expertise and departmental affiliate appointments. This award would carve out the necessary time for her to build a platform on which to formalize her mentoring approach and a curriculum to support a cadre of physician/scientists developing decision support tools aimed for clinical translation. This proposal takes advantage of a successful Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) funded at UW in 2006, committed to mentoring, patient oriented team science, and translational research. The aims included in this proposal are closely aligned with the UW CTSA -KL2 and other institutional training grants and fully leverage the rich mentoring and career development resources.  The patient oriented scientific aims proposed arise from healthcare shortfalls that she, a radiologist practicing in breast imaging, sees every day in clinic. They buid on her NCI funded R01 which asks the question: How can decision support in the clinic help healthcare providers optimize breast cancer screening and diagnosis in aging women? Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women = 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized strategies are needed to decrease morbidity and mortality, while minimizing harms (false positives and overdiagnosis-the detection of cancer that would not go on to cause symptoms or death). Though validated decision aids currently exist, immense opportunities still remain: personalization, integration in the clinical workflow, and implementation with high fidelity; all goals of this proposal. Personalized decision support tools will only be useful if they are thoughtfully designed and rigorously implemented.  Both her scientific aims and her career development plans integrate the new discipline of Implemenation Science. These methodologies will enable her to translate advances into an EMR-embedded decision tool for improved breast cancer screening decision-making for women = 65 and their physicians. Innovation is substantial; creating a tool that incorporates national simulation models to accurately convey outcomes that is integrated into the EMR has not been done. This award will enable Dr. Burnside to become an influential mentor of clinician-scientists using implementation science to advance personalized decision support into the clinic. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to build a mentorship program for clinicians who are developing tools that use a patient's unique characteristics to help make optimal health care decisions. The proposed research exemplifies this important goal by using the newest scientific techniques to develop and test a personalized decision tool to help women age 65 or over decide (with their physician) whether to undergo breast cancer screening. By combining mentoring, research, and new scientific methodologies, this plan will powerfully translate the science of personalized prediction to patients to help make decisions that are right for them.",Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis,9110927,K24CA194251,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Award ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Influentials ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Planning Technic ', ' Planning Methodology ', ' Planning Techniques ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychologist ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' cancer risk ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' cancer care ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' CISNET ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' implementation science ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' surveillance network ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' support tools ', ' personalized strategies ', ' individualized strategies ', ' personalized decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K24,2016,147059,0.27588535688574367
"SCH: EXP: Improving early detection and intervention of lymphedema  Many breast cancer survivors face long-term post-operative challenges as a result of suffering from breast cancer related lymphedema (hereafter, lymphedema), which causes abnormal swelling and multiple distressing and sometimes extremely painful symptoms. These symptoms have been linked to clinically detrimental outcomes, such as disability and psychological distress, both of which are known risk factors for breast cancer survivors' poor quality of life. More importantly, lymphedema symptoms may indicate an early stage of lymphedema that constitutes only minimal changes in objective measures of limb volume. Without timely intervention in this early disease stage, lymphedema can progress into a chronic condition that no surgical or medical interventions at present can cure. Yet, current clinical practice largely relies on clinicians' observation of swelling and current research methods for detecting and assessing lymphedema are cumbersome and not effective in detecting early stage of lymphedema. Thus, early detection of lymphedema based on symptoms and early intervention for lymphedema symptom management may play an important role in reducing the patient's risk for chronic lymphedema. The first primary goal of this project is to use machine learning to understand the association between symptoms and other relevant personal and clinical factors and the presence of lymphedema, and develop a web-based self-assessment platform that enables patients to assess their risk for lymphedema from anywhere. The second goal is to develop a Kinect-sensor based training system to improve the effectiveness of training for patients to learn and practice the intervention lymphatic exercises developed by the Pl Fu, which have shown great promise in reducing the risk of chronic lymphedema by maintaining pre-surgery limb volume, and relieving lymphedema symptoms. The proposed solutions empower breast cancer survivors to take control of their progression path of lymphedema, and will be integrated into our current IT-based self-care platform for lymphedema symptom management and lymphedema risk reduction, which focuses on preventive, proactive, evidence-based, person-centered approach to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Lymphedema, which causes multiple painful symptoms, is a major health problem that affects more than 40% of 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in the US. This project will develop a self-assessment platform for . early detection of lymphedema and a Kinect-based exercise training system to enhance early intervention. The project has the potential to relieve lymphedema symptoms and reduce the risk for chronic lymphedema.

"Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mammographic breast density (BD) is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. Most research studies generating this conclusion used an operator-assisted method (applied to digitized film) to estimate the percentage of BD (i.e. PD, the standard), which requires an expert technician to outline the breast region and define thresholds. Although clearly an invaluable research tool, this standard does not lend itself to automation, and is therefore not amenable for application in the clinical setting (i.e. large-scale implementation) for patient risk assessment and management. Our goal is to lay the foundation for translating the demonstrated research value of BD into the clinic by advancing our recent achievements in full field digital mammography (FFDM), the emerging standard modality for breast screening in the US. We developed a calibration system for FFDM using a specific unit that produced four significant findings: (1) a standardization technique that makes pixel values comparable across all images, (2) a new calibrated spatial variation BD measurement (or Vc) that offered a stronger measurement of risk than the standard, (3) Vc is a function of PD, another calibrated measure of BD that is also a significant risk factor, and other important risk covariates, i.e. high correlation but non-linear, and (4) demonstrated the variation measure (or V) applied to raw mammograms (or Vr) is also a significant breast cancer risk factor.  In this proposed work we build on our calibration approach and apply it to different FFDM units. We will validate the Vc and Vr measures from different FFDM technology and make comparisons with our previous findings using a matched case-control study using both pre-existing and new FFDM datasets. Because differences in detector designs have the potential to alter spatial variation, it is imperative to assess these influences n the new V-metrics to demonstrate that breast cancer risk is not dependent upon the system design. We will quantify the gains derived from calibration by comparing Vc and Vr, because gains are derived at the expense of advanced image processing and analyses. We will determine the optimal breast density measure and representation (i.e. is calibration required), where optimal is defined by these attributes: automated, quantitative, reproducible, consistent across different imaging platforms, and offers risk prediction at least equivalent with that offere by PD. To meet our objectives, we use accepted techniques and introduce novel analysis strategies that include statistical learning to better capture the relationships between the import risk covariates. This work will provide a prescription for making the optimal BD measurement. The successful completion of this work will allow the full scale integration of BD into the clinica environment. Potential applications include personalized care of patients in terms of screening frequency, risk reduction interventions, and the identification of situations where mammography may be ineffective (i.e. where dense tissue significantly reduces either sensitivity or specificityof mammography). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mammographic breast density is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. To date, the best way to calculate this measurement is not well understood. However, an operator-assisted measure is often used for research purposes. Due to measurement complexities breast density is not used for clinical based risk assessments. The focus of our work is full field digital mammography (FFDM). We use FFDM because the majority of accredited mammography facilities now operate FFDM units and FFDM will replace film systems eventually. Moreover, digital images from FFDM facilitate the processing methods. We are developing a method to measure this important factor from mammograms. We used experimental phantom imaging to adjust mammograms to make improved measures of breast density for full field digital mammography. Using advanced image processing techniques, we normalized mammograms so that they are comparable. This process allowed us to develop a new automated method of measuring breast density that shows stronger correlation with breast cancer than other measures. In this proposed work, we will explore the generalizations of our novel measure and evaluate it further with different types of mammography units. The work has important healthcare implications upon completion. This project will provide a technique that can be used in the clinic to (a) collect important serial brest density information, and (b) develop breast cancer risk models that include breast density.",Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density,9016496,R01CA166269,"['Accounting ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automation ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Calibration ', ' Environment ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Matched Case-Control Study ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Hospital Risk Reporting ', ' Risk Management ', ' Specificity ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Film ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' detector ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Imaging Phantoms ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' brca 1 gene ', ' RNF53 ', ' Hereditary Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Early Onset Gene Breast Cancer 1 ', ' Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Gene ', ' Breast Cancer 1 Gene ', ' BRCA1 ', ' BRCA1 gene ', ' Frequencies ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modality ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' screening ', ' personalized care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' individualized care ', ' Precision care ', ' Patient risk ', ' imaging platform ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Mechano-Visual Phenotyping of Cancer: From Onset Through Disease Progression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year. This translates to about 1560 deaths per day attributed to cancer - overall, in the US, 1 in every 4 deaths is attributed to cancer. In the US, cancer is the second most common cause of death only next to deaths due to heart disease. Future progress in several key areas of cancer research and drug discovery will rely upon the capacity of investigators to reliably detect, characterize and track subtle changes that occur in the tumor environment during the transformation from the benign to cancerous state. The central objective of this grant proposal is to design, develop and evaluate computational and imaging tools, which provide insight regarding the mechanical and morphological changes that occur starting with the onset of a malignancy and follow those changes throughout the course of disease progression using a representative ensemble of cancer tissue specimens from breast cancer cases. These new technologies will facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic and prognostic clues, which are not apparent using traditional methods of assessment.  The overarching objectives of the proposed project are: 1) to investigate changes in the mechanical characteristics of sampled tissues through accurate non-linear finite element modeling based on the experimentally captured atomic force microscopy (AFM) data, 2) to increase the sampling throughput to allow automated assessment of multiple regions of interest, simultaneously, using an array of micro force sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and 3) to compare the mechanical changes, expression signatures, and spatial distribution of biomarkers in the normal tissue samples with those collected at the onset of malignancy and throughout the primary stages of disease progression for breast cancer cases. Based on successful completion of these aims, we will design, develop and evaluate a reliable means for providing multimodal decision support for performing automated, higher-throughput characterization of specimens. Finally, our team will deploy, test and optimize the updated suite of computational and modeling tools at strategic adopter sites (Emory University and University of Pennsylvania - see letters of support).  To accomplish this, we have assembled an excellent team of engineers and clinicians from the University Of Maryland, College Park and The Cancer Institute of New Jersey for this extremely important NIH project. The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year.

"3-D modeling-based decision support for optimizing quality of life following breast reconstruction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast reconstruction is a central component of the breast cancer treatment process for many women. The purpose of breast reconstruction is to recreate a breast form that is satisfying to the patient, facilitating her psychosocial adjustment o living as a breast cancer survivor. Decisions about breast reconstruction can be difficult and overwhelming for many women due to the number of options available and conflicting values and preferences. The long-term goal of our research is to enhance the consultation process for women undergoing breast reconstruction surgery. Our vision is a decision support system that will enable breast cancer patients, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to choose a reconstruction strategy with maximal potential to optimize psychosocial adjustment. This system for shared decision-making will use quantitative models to tailor the presentation of patient-specific information about breast reconstruction outcomes. Three common features of decision support systems are the knowledge base; the methodology for combining that knowledge with patient-specific information; and the communication mechanisms. With recent NIH support, we established a unique knowledge base through a longitudinal study of 500 women who underwent breast reconstruction. We also developed preliminary computational models for combining that knowledge base with patient-specific data. Our models are parameterized by experimental, clinical, and psychosocial data and employ techniques from 3D image analysis, biomechanical modeling and simulation, machine learning, and decision analysis. In the proposed project, we will develop predictive algorithms for combining the knowledge base and patient- specific information, and we will develop communication mechanisms both for gathering necessary patient- specific information and for delivering information about the decision basis to the patient and her multidisciplinary care team.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our vision is a decision support system that will enable breast cancer patients, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to choose a reconstruction strategy that will lead to maximal psychosocial adjustment.

"Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Molecular Imaging for Breast Lesion Characterization PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Claiming more than 40,000 lives in the United States in 2015, breast cancer presents an important health focus. Mammography and ultrasound, current screening methods, suffer from low sensitivity and low positive predictive value, respectively, particularly in patients with dense breast tissues. Therefore, a non-invasive method of distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions that could be incorporated with current screening modalities is critically needed. With more advanced screening methods, there is an increase in the detection of early malignant lesions, for which breast-conserving treatment has become more routine. However, intraoperative frozen-section margin assessment is time consuming and suffers from low sensitivity, while post-operative histological analysis leaves potential for positive margins, strongly correlated with reoccurrence. Therefore, a real-time method to detect tumor margins intraoperatively is critically needed. We propose using spectroscopic photoacoustic and fluorescence molecular imaging combined with a clinically- translatable contrast agent targeted to a novel breast cancer marker (B7-H3) to non-invasively distinguish normal from malignant tissues both during screening (aim 1) and intraoperatively during surgical resection (aim 3). The sensitivity of this imaging method will be increased with the use of machine learning post-processing algorithms to autonomously detect molecular B7-H3 signal (aim 2). In summary, this proposal will result in significant change to current clinical breast imaging and surgical resection practice to improve the detection and treatment of focal breast lesions. The training portion of this plan, required to accomplish these research goals, has been designed with trainee mentors with specific technical expertise. Dr. Willmann is an expert in translational molecular imaging and contrast agent use, while Dr. Rubin is an expert in bioinformatics, image processing, and machine learning for medical imagine purposes. Additionally, the project is supported by a diverse advisory committee with experts in clinical breast imaging (Dr. Debra Ikeda), optical imaging and intraoperative guidance (Dr. Christopher Contag), and clinical breast surgery (Dr. Irene Wapnir). To date, the candidate has developed expertise in photoacoustic, ultrasound, and fluorescence molecular imaging and molecular contrast agent development and in vivo use during her graduate and postdoctoral research. Her long term career goals include developing clinically translatable combined spectroscopic photoacoustic and fluorescence molecular imaging methods combined with novel contrast agents for cancer detection and differentiation. Additionally, her research will focus on developing machine learning algorithms for increasing the sensitivity of the molecular imaging approach as well as adapting her method for therapeutic purposes. In preparation for her independent research career, the training plan includes formal education in machine learning, digital signal processing, optical imaging, and cancer biology, as well as in career development classes and ethical conduct of research. Narrative Mammography and ultrasound used for breast cancer screening suffer from low sensitivity and low positive predictive value in women with dense breast tissue (40%). Here, combined spectroscopic photoacoustic and fluorescence molecular imaging used with a clinically-translatable contrast agent targeted to a novel breast cancer marker and novel machine learning based spectral recognition algorithms are explored for noninvasive differentiation between benign and malignant lesions and for intraoperative tumor margin assessment. The project is supported by excellent mentors, Drs. Willmann and Rubin, and a diverse advisory committee, Drs. Contag, Ikeda, and Wapnir, and proposes an extended training plan including formal and informal learning opportunities, to aid the PI on her transition to independent faculty.",Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Molecular Imaging for Breast Lesion Characterization,9314864,K99EB023279,"['absorption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' DCIS ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Digital Signal Processing ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Faculty ', ' Female ', ' Fluorescence ', ' fluorescent dye/probe ', ' Fluorescent Agents ', ' Fluorescence Agents ', ' Fluorescent Dyes ', ' Freeze Sectioning ', ' Frozen Sections ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hyperplastic ', ' Hyperplasia ', ' Indocyanine Green ', ' Wofaverdin ', ' Ujoveridin ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Mammography ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Noise ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Specificity ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' technical skills ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work.

"A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Critical clinical activities involve decision making. For both individual patients and for society at large, making good healthcare decisions is a paramount task. The objective of this research is to develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assit the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient.      Traditional clinical data are becoming increasingly available in electronic form. Unprecedentedly abundant genomic data are available to researchers as the results of advanced sequencing technologies such as next generation sequencing. Patient-specific genomic data are likely to become available for most patients in the foreseeable future. These sources of data provide significant opportunities for developing new generation clinical decision support systems that can achieve substantial progress over what is currently possible. However, the sheer magnitude of the number of variables in these data (often in the millions) presents formidable computational and modeling challenges. Also, integrating the heterogeneous information in multiple clinical datasets and genomic datasets presents an arduous challenge.      Breast cancer is the commonest cancer among women. Various breast cancer subtypes have been defined which, along with tumor stage, predict response to therapy and survival, albeit imperfectly. For example, HER2-amplified breast cancer is a subtype with poor prognosis, and therapy with an antibody to HER2 (Herceptin) has vastly improved the survival of such patients. Although Herceptin is used in the therapy of all patients with HER2-amplified tumors, only some respond. Also, it is expensive and can cause cardiac toxicity. So, it is important to give it only o patients benefiting from it. Studies show thousands of genes are associated with subtype and prognosis of breast cancer, and particular allele combinations may usefully guide the selection of effective treatment. The proposed system will amass all this genomic information and combine it with clinical information and therefore holds promise to provide accurate classification and treatment choices.      We will build the knowledge base of the proposed system using the following sources: 1) The Medical Archival Systems at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center; 2) The Lynn Sage Database used by the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center at Northwestern Memorial Hospital; 3) The breast cancer data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas project; and 4) Dream 7 Breast Cancer Challenge Data. The proposed system will build on previous results of the investigators in using Bayesian Network to learn from high-dimensional data sets. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record, including NIH funding, publications in biomedical informatics and artificial intelligence, and experience developing cutting-edge decision support systems. Even a modest improvement in the efficacy of clinical decision making has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. This project will develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assist the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient. We call this system A Clinical Decision Support System for Making Personalized Assessments and Recommendations Concerning Breast Cancer Patients (DPAC).",A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System,9281905,R01LM011663,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Antibodies ', ' Archives ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' dreaming ', ' Dreams ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Hospitals ', ' Learning ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' therapy selection ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' neu Genes ', ' herstatin ', ' erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 Proto-Oncogenes ', ' c-erbB-2 Genes ', ' c-erbB-2 ', ' TKR1 ', ' Oncogene ErbB2 ', ' NEU protein ', ' NEU Oncogene ', ' HER2/neu ', ' HER2 Genes ', ' HER2 ', ' HER-2 ', ' HER -2 ', ' ERBB2 ', ' ERBB2 gene ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' novel ', ' Decision Support Systems ', ' Cardiotoxicity ', ' Cardiotoxic ', ' Cardiac Toxicity ', ' Genomics ', ' Tumor stage ', ' T-Stage ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' clinical efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' clinical care ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' genomic profiles ', ' individual patient ', ' treatment choice ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' genomic data ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,460025,0.28459311149826305

In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer. The functionality of the software will substantially transcend limitations of current analysis of cancer images, and will open the way for more precise and effective surgical planning as well as for more specific diagnosis of cancer based on its imaging characteristics, eventually leading to individualized medicine.",Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast

"Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk Project Summary/Abstract Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women at the age of 40 and older. Mammography has been used as a low-cost screening tool for breast cancer. The recent controversy on breast cancer screening recommendations has increased public awareness and interests for informed counseling of screening and health care options based on individualized estimates of risk. The goal of this proposed project is to develop a computerized image-based biomarker to assess the breast cancer risk of individual patients in the screening population. The innovation of our approach lies in the fact that the quantitative breast parenchyma descriptor (q-BPD) will be designed to take into account not only the percentage of dense tissue (PD) but also the stromal and epithelial structural pattern of an individual's breast that is complementary to, rather than a surrogate of, the breast density. The q-BPD is obtained by a joint analysis of the complexity of the parenchymal distribution pattern (mammographic parenchymal pattern, MPP) and the amount of dense tissue (PD) as they are imaged on full-field digital mammograms (FFDMs). We hypothesize that the proposed q-BPD is an independent risk factor for breast cancer and will have a stronger predictive power than previous approaches such as PD or BI-RADS density categories alone. To test the hypothesis, we have the following specific aims: (1) to collect a matched case-control data set of 500 breast cancer cases and 2000 matched controls with 5 years of prior FFDMs (prior to cancer diagnosis for the case group). We will split the entire data set into independent subsets for training and validation; (2) to design a q- BPD by using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to maximize the discriminatory power at the personal level; (3) to investigate the association of developed q-BPD with breast cancer risk in comparison with commonly used density descriptors, such as radiologist's estimates of BI-RADS density categories and interactive PD on FFDMs by case-control studies and statistical analyses, taking into account other confounding risk factors. When fully developed, the automated q-BPD can be incorporated as a part of routine breast cancer screening. It will not only be useful for breast cancer risk prediction for individual patients but also for monitoring of risk regression or progression over time due to treatment or other factors. The new risk prediction tool is expected to play a key role in personalized breast cancer screening for women at different risk levels, thereby reducing health care costs while benefiting high risk women. The success of this project will lay the foundation for future large-scale clinica trials to address the limitations and investigate the clinical utilities of the proposed q-BPD for breast cancer risk prediction. Key Words: quantitative breast parenchyma analysis, image-based biomarker, breast cancer risk prediction, full-field digital mammogram (FFDM) PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed quantitative descriptor of breast parenchyma (q-BPD) can serve as a cost-effective biomarker to assist in stratification of screening strategy for individuals, follow-up, risk management, and monitoring of preventive treatment of high-risk women or interventional treatment of breast cancer patients, as well as for research and development of new treatment regimens.

"Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K24 proposal combines mentoring in patient oriented cancer control research; research to translate evidence-based shared decision-support for screening mammography to the clinic; and career development in Implementation Science. The PI, Dr. Elizabeth Burnside, has been an influential mentor throughout her career at the University of Wisconsin (UW), fostered by leadership positions like her role as the co-lead of the Cancer Control Program in the UW NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Her mentoring and research both promote team science, which unites medical and ""translational"" disciplines like informatics, engineering, and population health, all areas for which she has expertise and departmental affiliate appointments. This award would carve out the necessary time for her to build a platform on which to formalize her mentoring approach and a curriculum to support a cadre of physician/scientists developing decision support tools aimed for clinical translation. This proposal takes advantage of a successful Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) funded at UW in 2006, committed to mentoring, patient oriented team science, and translational research. The aims included in this proposal are closely aligned with the UW CTSA -KL2 and other institutional training grants and fully leverage the rich mentoring and career development resources.  The patient oriented scientific aims proposed arise from healthcare shortfalls that she, a radiologist practicing in breast imaging, sees every day in clinic. They buid on her NCI funded R01 which asks the question: How can decision support in the clinic help healthcare providers optimize breast cancer screening and diagnosis in aging women? Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women = 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized strategies are needed to decrease morbidity and mortality, while minimizing harms (false positives and overdiagnosis-the detection of cancer that would not go on to cause symptoms or death). Though validated decision aids currently exist, immense opportunities still remain: personalization, integration in the clinical workflow, and implementation with high fidelity; all goals of this proposal. Personalized decision support tools will only be useful if they are thoughtfully designed and rigorously implemented.  Both her scientific aims and her career development plans integrate the new discipline of Implemenation Science. These methodologies will enable her to translate advances into an EMR-embedded decision tool for improved breast cancer screening decision-making for women = 65 and their physicians. Innovation is substantial; creating a tool that incorporates national simulation models to accurately convey outcomes that is integrated into the EMR has not been done. This award will enable Dr. Burnside to become an influential mentor of clinician-scientists using implementation science to advance personalized decision support into the clinic. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to build a mentorship program for clinicians who are developing tools that use a patient's unique characteristics to help make optimal health care decisions. The proposed research exemplifies this important goal by using the newest scientific techniques to develop and test a personalized decision tool to help women age 65 or over decide (with their physician) whether to undergo breast cancer screening. By combining mentoring, research, and new scientific methodologies, this plan will powerfully translate the science of personalized prediction to patients to help make decisions that are right for them.",Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis,9297263,K24CA194251,"['Adoption ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Award ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Influentials ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mammography ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Psychologist ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Decision Aid ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' cancer risk ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' cancer care ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Resource Development ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' CISNET ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' implementation science ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' surveillance network ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' support tools ', ' personalized strategies ', ' individualized strategies ', ' personalized decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' clinical translation ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K24,2017,173648,0.27588535688574367
"3-D modeling-based decision support for optimizing quality of life following breast reconstruction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast reconstruction is a central component of the breast cancer treatment process for many women. The purpose of breast reconstruction is to recreate a breast form that is satisfying to the patient, facilitating her psychosocial adjustment o living as a breast cancer survivor. Decisions about breast reconstruction can be difficult and overwhelming for many women due to the number of options available and conflicting values and preferences. The long-term goal of our research is to enhance the consultation process for women undergoing breast reconstruction surgery. Our vision is a decision support system that will enable breast cancer patients, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to choose a reconstruction strategy with maximal potential to optimize psychosocial adjustment. This system for shared decision-making will use quantitative models to tailor the presentation of patient-specific information about breast reconstruction outcomes. Three common features of decision support systems are the knowledge base; the methodology for combining that knowledge with patient-specific information; and the communication mechanisms. With recent NIH support, we established a unique knowledge base through a longitudinal study of 500 women who underwent breast reconstruction. We also developed preliminary computational models for combining that knowledge base with patient-specific data. Our models are parameterized by experimental, clinical, and psychosocial data and employ techniques from 3D image analysis, biomechanical modeling and simulation, machine learning, and decision analysis. In the proposed project, we will develop predictive algorithms for combining the knowledge base and patient- specific information, and we will develop communication mechanisms both for gathering necessary patient- specific information and for delivering information about the decision basis to the patient and her multidisciplinary care team. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our vision is a decision support system that will enable breast cancer patients, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to choose a reconstruction strategy that will lead to maximal psychosocial adjustment.

"Combination FGFR4 and ER-Targeted Therapy for Invasive Lobular Carcinoma Project Summary Even though invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) accounts for 10-15% of the breast cancer seen in the US, there remains much to be learned about the unique nature of this disease. For example, patients with ILC are likely to have tumors with expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ER), a biomarker of good prognosis. Yet, patients with ER+ ILC have worse long-term outcomes compared to patients with the more commonly studied subtype of ER+ invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). The standard treatment regimen for ER+ disease includes endocrine therapy, so the big picture focus of this grant asks: why do some ILC patients have a worse outcome than expected on endocrine therapy, and for those patients, what additional treatments can we provide? This grant aims to assess the effect of FGFR4 expression on cell survival and signaling in vitro, identify biomarkers for FGFR4 activation in silico, and test the efficacy of FGFR4 inhibition on clinical samples ex vivo. Methods include 1) FGFR4 inhibition with shRNAs and small-molecule inhibitors, 2) RNA-Sequencing, 3) machine-learning, and 4) explant models of ILC patient tumors. The ultimate goal of the proposed aims is to provide rationale for specific combination targeted therapy in patients with lobular breast cancer, in accordance with the mission statement of the NCI. Project Narrative The goal of this research is to identify why endocrine therapy has lasting benefits for only a subset of women with breast cancer. The proposed studies include RNA-Sequencing to understand how molecular changes impact survival outcomes.

"Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and is characteristically an aggressive cancer, especially in a metastatic setting. Approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers are TNBC. In spite of recent improvements in TNBC treatment, the lack of known specific therapeutic targets and the heterogeneous response to chemotherapy make it difficult to attack TNBC and obtain a consistent outcome and meaningful benefit. Recently, cisplatin chemotherapy has regained interest based on growing evidence on achieving better outcome from preclinical and clinical data. However, many TNBC patients are not responding to the treatment; and there is no clinical practical way to identify in which individuals' cisplatin chemotherapy will be effective t avoid unnecessary toxicity and cost of healthcare.         The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, for identifying novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in TNBC more accurately and efficiently from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The recent discovery of the p63/p73 expression, p53 mutation and measurements of DNA repair status effects on the sensitivity to cisplatin in TNBC patients has indicated the existence of cisplatin response predictors and the need for further investigation. In this study, we will develo a novel sequence-based copy number variation (CNV) detection tool, using signal processing techniques; and a novel supervised integrative analysis tool, based on Bayesian network analysis which integrates CNV, point mutation and gene expression data. We will hone and validate the innovative methods and tools on publically available data such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Then by collaborating with oncologists and pathologists from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and using the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center DNA Resource Core services, we will generate novel DNA sequence and RNA- seq datasets on responsive and non-responsive TNBC tumor samples from an existing clinical trial, which was designed to study preoperative cisplatin in early-stage breast cancer. By applying the proposed computational framework we will shed unprecedented light on potential predictors of TNBC response to cisplatin therapy that can help guide biomarker selection. We will verify the candidate biomarkers through gene ontology and pathway analyses. In addition, we will analyze TCGA data to determine the prevalence of these candidate biomarkers in TNBC. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, to more accurately and efficiently identify novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from next-generation sequencing data. Successful completion of this proposal will result in two important public health impacts: (1) Candidate ""response"" biomarkers of cisplatin chemotherapy responsive TNBCs, and (2) A computational approach supporting personalized medicine for TNBC. Furthermore, once established, this framework can be extended to the detection of biomarkers in other tumor types, and can contribute to improving the drug development process and the effectiveness of

"Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose that collagen features, such as alignment, fiber straightness and width, and other features of extracellular matrix composition can be used as an early biomarker of breast cancer. It is the goal of this proposal to determine the range of collagen structural features that characterize normal, benign and early disease, to determine how these features relate to mammographic density, and to identify the features that best predict risk, recurrence, and progression. This proposal leverages a diverse collaborative team that includes experts in imaging and understanding the tumor microenvironment, breast surgery, experts in population health and biostatistics, and an expert in proteomic analysis of the ECM. This team will analyze a set of patient cohorts to develop imaging and analysis of collagen structure and ECM composition as a potential early biomarker for breast cancer. Aims: 1) Characterize collagen features that define heterogeneity of the normal state. 2) Characterize collagen features in pre- and early breast cancer lesions. 3) Characterize the proteomics of biopsies representing benign, at risk, and invasive breast cancer. Significance: This project meets the goals of the RFA to develop and validate combined imaging and biomarker approaches to improve early cancer detection and the diagnosis of early-stage cancers. Our findings have the potential to reduce overdiagnosis and false positives and discern lethal from non-lethal disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The widespread adoption of screening mammography throughout the 1980s and 1990s led to a reduction in breast cancer mortality as more women were diagnosed at an earlier stage of disease and could be more successfully treated. Apart from their use in visualizing the tumor, mammograms are quantifiable based on the density of the signal in the image, which is based on the absorbance of x-rays by cells and the filamentous protein collagen. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and in the breast is present as a scaffolding network that supports the milk-secreting epithelial cells of this gland. In non-diseased breasts, the mammographic density is a function of the amount of collagen present, and is highly correlated to a 4-6 fold increased risk of developing breast cancer in the future. Mammographic density has been deemed so important that over a dozen states have recently passed legislation requiring physicians to inform patients of this value. However, the problem is that mammographic density does not predict survival once a tumor has been detected. Thus, although we have improved our detection of breast cancers, we do not have the ability to sort patients into groups where disease progresses from those that do not. Our current paradigm of treating everyone aggressively needs to change to a targeted plan of treating only those women at risk of future life-threatening disease. It is our hypothesis that it is not the overall macroscpic amount of collagen present, but rather the structure and organization of collagen at the local level which predicts cancer progression. We will examine tissue samples from a variety of non-diseased human patient cohorts, with the goal of discovering a biomarker for disease progression based on collagen structure. This will be done non-invasively by imaging slides that are already routinely prepared using a technique called second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy which selectively images collagen. We have advanced software which will measure the length, width, straightness, density and orientation of fibers that we can use to analyze tens of thousands of collagen fibers from dozens of images per sample. This high level of quantitation improves our statistical ability to discover the underlying biomarker from the noise. By understanding the normal non-diseased state, we can apply this knowledge to very early cancer stages in order to sort patients into aggressive and non-aggressive therapy groups. As a compliment to these studies, we will also determine the protein composition of the collagen matrix, as there are dozens of other proteins present. Preliminary data has shown changes in the makeup of proteins found in normal tissue compared to breast cancer, implying that the change in collagen structure is related to the underlying expression of proteins there. Through our proposed experiments, we will establish what a truly ""normal"" collagen matrix looks like in terms of structure and composition.",Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma,9344562,R01CA199996,"['Adoption ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Archives ', ' Attention ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' mammary disorder ', ' Breast Disorder ', ' Breast Diseases ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' DCIS ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Collagen ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' ECM ', ' Cell-Extracellular Matrix ', ' Extracellular Matrix ', ' Freezing ', ' Future ', ' Glycoproteins ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Mammography ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Menopause ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Microscopy ', ' mortality ', ' Needles ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Proteins ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Stains ', ' Time ', ' Tissue Banks ', ' Tissue Collection ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Xrays ', ' X-Rays Radiation ', ' X-Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Normal Values ', ' Normal Range ', ' base ', ' density ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Lesion ', ' Collagen Fiber ', ' Fiber ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' scaffold ', ' scaffolding ', ' Aspirate substance ', ' Aspirate ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' Image Guided Biopsy ', ' Staining method ', ' Stainings ', ' Width ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' cohort ', ' Breast Carcinoma ', ' Mammary Carcinoma ', ' Structure ', ' breast surgery ', ' Sampling ', ' Proteomics ', ' Stromal Neoplasm ', ' Stromal Tumor ', ' protein expression ', ' Gland ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Data ', ' Global Change ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' mammographic breast density ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' second harmonic ', ' obesity risk ', ' volunteer ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' minimally invasive ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' population health ', ' screening ', ' non-invasive imaging ', ' noninvasive imaging ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' support network ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' second harmonic generation imaging ', ' SHG imaging ', ' milk secretion ', ' secrete milk ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,431130,0.34734208477248746
"Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) tend to be less responsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy than ER-negative breast cancers; advanced ER+ breast cancer remains largely incurable. Moreover, this breast cancer subtype frequently exhibits marked dormancy, conferring upon patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that persists for decades after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Why ER+ breast is the most strongly associated with dormancy is unknown and represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Since 70% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are ER+ but ~50% of these eventually recur, many doing so years after cessation of an otherwise apparently successful initial intervention, significance of the dormant phenotype is clear. Using transcriptome data from pretreatment tumors from women with ER+ breast cancer who were subsequently treated with tamoxifen (TAM) as their only systemic therapy, we derived an initial molecular classifier that robustly separates early (d 3 yrs) from late (e 5 yrs; emergence from dormancy) distant recurrences in both training and independent datasets. We then identified novel features of the ""early"" (E) vs. ""late"" (L) signaling network's topology in thse datasets. We also developed an adaptation of the DMBA-induced rat mammary tumor model and show that it represents E, L, and ""not"" (N) recurring tumors, molecular features of which are present in human breast tumors and cell lines. Mechanistically, our data implicate a ""rewiring"" (including epigenetic events) of the signaling from the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, and adaptations in cellular metabolism, as the molecular events that may enable cells to maintain, and later escape from, dormancy. Our central hypothesis is that dormancy reflects the growth arrest induced by endocrine therapies in both residual tumors (in-breast recurrences) and micro-metastases (distant recurrences), and that the signaling maintaining dormancy after systemic therapy ends is epigenetically regulated. Indeed, prolonged hormone therapy may well work by extending dormancy. Individual cells can emerge from dormancy as their metabolic capacity becomes sufficient to support both survival and replication, and the integrated balance between autophagy (prosurvival) and apoptosis (prodeath) signaling enables more cells in a tumor to proliferate and the tumor population size to grow. We propose an integrated, multidisciplinary research program that, if successful, will generate innovative insights into the molecular drivers of dormancy in ER+ breast cancers, develop new in silico signaling models, identify predictors of patient risk to experience a late recurrence, and explore mechanisms of dormancy with the longer term goal of discovering potentially novel therapeutic interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) comprise 70% of all newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers. ER+ breast tumors represent the breast cancer subtype most strongly associated with tumor dormancy, conferring upon these patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that can persist for decades after initial diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, very little is known abou the molecular drivers that determine the onset, maintenance, and emergence from dormancy. Our multidisciplinary team will apply state-of-the-art technologies to several unique, independent, human breast cancer data sets (including matched primary and recurrent tumors from the same individuals) and a rat mammary tumor model to address two fundamental aspects of dormancy; i.e., we will (i) accurately and robustly identify those breast cancer patients at greatest risk of experiencing a late recurrence (e 5 yrs after initial diagnosis) and (i) define the molecular events driving dormancy to help develop new treatment strategies that can be targeted to these patients.",Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology,9350254,U01CA184902,"['dimethylbenz(a)anthracene ', ' DMBA ', ' dimethylbenzanthracene ', ' Malignant Adenoma ', ' Adenocarcinoma ', '

"Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis PROJECT SUMMARY  The advent of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) or “3D mammography” brings promise of improved sensitivity and specificity. Even as DBT undergoes rapid clinical adoption, this new imaging modality poses new challenges to radiologists due to many differences in image appearance compared to conventional mammography. Recent studies and clinical experience show the urgent need for improved training in DBT. These changes necessitate dedicated training for both radiology residents and board-certified radiologists. The currently accepted training paradigm (i.e., the “one size fits all” approach) cannot effectively accommodate the individual needs of each radiologist-in-training. We propose to address this shortcoming.  This project seeks to develop a new paradigm of adaptive, computer-enhanced training in the interpretation of DBT. Using predictive algorithms similar to the recommendation systems of companies like Amazon and Netflix, our system will create a training environment tailored to the needs of each individual radiologist. We have shown that the radiologists-in-training do not make errors in a random manner; instead their error making demonstrates specific patterns. Even more importantly, those errors can be predicted from each individual’s previous interpretations. We propose to use machine learning-based user modeling as well as collaborative filtering algorithms to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each individual. Then, we will adapt the training protocol to the individual needs of the trainee in order to accelerate the training and improve his/her diagnostic skills in the areas that need improvement. The aims are: (1) develop user models that predict the difficulty of a DBT case based its image features and trainee performance, (2) implement an educational system that presents training cases that focus on the unique needs of each individual, and (3) conduct a reader study to validate the improved effectiveness of the proposed adaptive system.  This has work has the following key innovations. We propose the first ever computer-aided education system for residents and radiologists that is adaptive and individualized. We leverage cutting edge concepts from the fields of user modeling and collaborative filtering, which our lab has introduced to the field of medical imaging. This work addresses training limitations for the newly adopted modality of DBT.  This research has very high clinical significance: Improving training in the interpretation of breast images will ensure the greatest benefit of breast cancer screening. The proposed work, while developing a fully functional DBT education system, will contribute to the foundation for a more general, new paradigm of improved individualized education that extends to other image interpretation tasks and imaging modalities. This work is a collaboration between computer vision and machine learning experts, breast imaging radiologists, director of Radiology residency, a biostatistician, and a human factors expert. Our technology will be disseminated through a partnership with IMAIOS, a leading provider of online radiology education. Digital breast tomosynthesis is becoming a standard practice in breast cancer screening and there is a pressing need for effective education in this new modality. In this study we propose to develop a computer system for education in digital breast tomosynthesis that adapts itself to each trainee and to find an individualized training protocol that fits best the trainee’s needs. Such system could improve dramatically the time efficiency of training in digital breast tomosynthesis images and improve diagnostic performance of the trainees. This is likely to improve the overall effectiveness of breast cancer screening and, given high importance of breast cancer screening, decrease mortality rate of the disease.",Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis,9321997,R01EB021360,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breast ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Computers ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' continuing medical education ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Hand ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Mammography ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residencies ', ' Rest ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' RDST ', ' radiologist ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' case-based ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' clinical practice ', ' Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,396791,0.2766951105647728
"SCH: EXP: Improving early detection and intervention of lymphedema  Many breast cancer survivors face long-term post-operative challenges as a result of suffering from breast cancer related lymphedema (hereafter, lymphedema), which causes abnormal swelling and multiple distressing and sometimes extremely painful symptoms. These symptoms have been linked to clinically detrimental outcomes, such as disability and psychological distress, both of which are known risk factors for breast cancer survivors' poor quality of life. More importantly, lymphedema symptoms may indicate an early stage of lymphedema that constitutes only minimal changes in objective measures of limb volume. Without timely intervention in this early disease stage, lymphedema can progress into a chronic condition that no surgical or medical interventions at present can cure. Yet, current clinical practice largely relies on clinicians' observation of swelling and current research methods for detecting and assessing lymphedema are cumbersome and not effective in detecting early stage of lymphedema. Thus, early detection of lymphedema based on symptoms and early intervention for lymphedema symptom management may play an important role in reducing the patient's risk for chronic lymphedema. The first primary goal of this project is to use machine learning to understand the association between symptoms and other relevant personal and clinical factors and the presence of lymphedema, and develop a web-based self-assessment platform that enables patients to assess their risk for lymphedema from anywhere. The second goal is to develop a Kinect-sensor based training system to improve the effectiveness of training for patients to learn and practice the intervention lymphatic exercises developed by the Pl Fu, which have shown great promise in reducing the risk of chronic lymphedema by maintaining pre-surgery limb volume, and relieving lymphedema symptoms. The proposed solutions empower breast cancer survivors to take control of their progression path of lymphedema, and will be integrated into our current IT-based self-care platform for lymphedema symptom management and lymphedema risk reduction, which focuses on preventive, proactive, evidence-based, person-centered approach to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Lymphedema, which causes multiple painful symptoms, is a major health problem that affects more than 40% of 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in the US. This project will develop a self-assessment platform for . early detection of lymphedema and a Kinect-based exercise training system to enhance early intervention. The project has the potential to relieve lymphedema symptoms and reduce the risk for chronic lymphedema.

"Characterization of Emca4, the Rat Ortholog of the 8q24 Breast Cancer Risk Locus Project Summary The ultimate goal of this research is to define the mechanisms through which specific endocrine and genetic risk factors contribute to breast cancer development. The focus of this proposed study is Emca4, a genetic determinant of susceptibility to 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced mammary cancer in the rat that has been mapped to rat chromosome 7 (RNO7). Data presented herein indicate that Emca4 harbors multiple genetic determinants of mammary cancer susceptibility that are orthologous to breast cancer risk loci mapped to chromosome 8q24.21. Also presented are novel data that indicate that a risk prediction model based on genotype across the Emca4 orthologous regions in the human genome can accurately distinguish cases from controls in a previously characterized case/control cohort. The primary objectives of this proposed study are to identify the cell types in which and the mechanisms through which the Emca4 variants influence development of mammary cancer. The knowledge gained will be translate to studies of human derived biospecimens to assess relevance of the data emerging from the rat models. Aim 1 is to define the mechanisms through which Emca4.1 determines susceptibility to E2-induced mammary cancer. The genes upon which the Emca4.1 variants act will be identified in defined mammary cell populations. Aim 2 is to define the mechanism through which Emca4.4 influences mammary cancer susceptibility and modifies the actions of Emca4.1. The molecular bases of the epistatic interactions between Emca4.4 and Emca4.1 on mammary cancer susceptibility and the cellular and molecular phenotypes regulated by Emca4.4 and Emca4.1 will be defined. Specific Aim 3 is to define the function(s) of Pvt1 in the rat mammary gland and its role in mammary cancer development. Attention will be focused on functionally characterizing Pvt1 promoters and exons that are impacted by endocrine and genetic factors or differ between matched normal and neoplastic mammary/breast tissues. Novel, physiologically relevant, rat models of E2-induced mammary cancer will be utilized in this research. Successful completion of the proposed studies proposed is expected to identify the cell types in which the actions of the Emca4 variants on mammary cancer susceptibility are exerted, the specific gene product(s) that confers the actions of the Emca4 variants in those cell types, and the downstream biological processes that are influenced by the functional orthologs that reside within Emca4. The information generated in these studies is expected to advance our understanding of the etiology of the luminal breast cancer subtypes. Relevance to public health: This proposed research utilizes novel and physiologically relevant rat models of 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced mammary cancer to define the mechanisms and sites of action of “functional orthologs” that reside within the Emca4 mammary cancer susceptibility locus in rat and the genetically orthologous 8q24 breast cancer risk locus in humans. By genetically linking the Emca4/8q24 functional orthologs to the biological processes that influence development of E2-induced mammary cancer, these studies will enhance our knowledge of how genetic and endocrine factors interact to influence normal mammary gland biology and mammary cancer susceptibility and will lay the foundation for development of novel strategies for breast cancer risk prediction and prevention.","Characterization of Emca4, the Rat Ortholog of the 8q24 Breast Cancer Risk Locus",9311738,R01CA204320,"['Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Alternative RNA Splicing ', ' Alternate Splicing ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Biology ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Human Chromosomes ', ' Chromosome 7 ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7 ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' Exons ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maps ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Translating ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Genetic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' cell type ', ' Endocrine ', ' cancer risk ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' PVT1 gene ', ' PVT1 ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Mammary gland ', ' mammary ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' genetic determinant ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Orthologous Gene ', ' Ortholog ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Data ', ' Rat Strains ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' 8q24 ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Transcript ', ' Mammary Gland Tissue ', ' Breast Tissue ', ' Mammary Gland Parenchyma ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' neoplastic ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' susceptibility variant ', ' susceptibility locus ', ' susceptibility allele ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' rat genome ', ' molecular phenotype ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' risk variant ', ' risk locus ', ' risk loci ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk gene ', ' risk allele ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR method ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' chromosome capture ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' gene product ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' Oncoproteins ', ' Oncogene Proteins ', ' Oncogene Products ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,418643,0.16574094507092618
"Reducing recall rates of screening mammography with deep convolutional neural network PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the recent successes of screening mammography, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in women and the leading cause of death in women aged 45 to 55. This suggests that there is an urgent need to improve the current approaches to breast cancer screening based on mammography. The specificity of the screening mammography is also limited as the continued large fraction of false-positives often leads to unnecessary follow-up procedures including biopsy that cause considerable pain, anxiety and cost. It is therefore necessary to improve diagnostic accuracy of mammography in terms of both sensitivity for early detection of breast cancer and specificity to keep the recall rate 10% or less as recommended by American College of Radiology. In this study, we investigate deep convolutional networks (DCN) for medical imaging by developing from scratch a novel family of DCNs based on the characteristics of medical images and evaluating it on screening mammographic exams. We design a novel, multi-view DCN that will work with a set of multiple views in their original resolution so as to avoid missing crucial micro-structures, opposed to using heavily downscaled images as often done with natural images or by some earlier work on applying DCN to medical images. Unlike most existing works which verify their approaches on a small number of cases, we propose to train and test the proposed networks on a large-scale data consisting of about 500,000 cases collected over the period of five years at our institution. Our preliminary experiments using an initial version of the multi-view deep convolutional network with about 25,000 cases strongly support the need for the proposed large-scale, high- resolution deep learning for early-stage breast cancer screening. We have also collected 201,000 cases of screening mammograms to date and are in the process of annotating the cases based on the available follow- up studies. The overarching goal of this study is to develop, optimize and test a multi-view DCN system that can either independently read a series of screening mammographic exams to identify early breast cancers accurately or to assist a human reader so as to reduce reading time and improve confidence in early breast cancer detection. Aim 1 is to develop and optimize a multi-view DCN for automatic breast screening. Aim 2 is to conduct preliminary reader study on the impact of the MV-DCN as a screening exam aid system. The outcome of this study, the multi-view DCN for automatic breast screening and the preliminary assessment of its impact on human readers, will form an important basis on which further investigation into optimizing deep convolution networks for medical imaging can be conducted.

"Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression Approximately 20% of breast cancers detected through mammography are pre-invasive Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS). If left untreated, approximately 20-50% of DCIS will progress to more deadly Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). No prognostic biomarkers can reliably predict the risk of progression from DCIS to IDC. Similar genomic profiles of matched pre-invasive DCIS and IDC suggests that the progression is not driven by genetic aberrations in DCIS cells, but microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia and metabolic stress prevalent in DCIS, may drive the transition. We need innovative models to investigate how to halt steps of DCIS progression to invasive phenotypes and subsequent metastasis from the primary site. This proposal directly addresses this unmet need by developing a novel three-dimensional in vitro organoid model that recapitulates key hallmarks of DCIS to IDC progression: tumor-size induced hypoxia and metabolic stress, tumor heterogeneity and spontaneous emergence of migratory phenotype in the same parent cells without any additional stimulus. A tangible advantage of the proposed organoid models is the ability to precisely and reproducibly study how the hypoxic microenvironment induces tumor migration in real time and in isolation from non-tumor cells present in vivo, providing unique opportunity to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of DCIS to IDC progression. Our preliminary observations lead to central hypothesis that tumor size-induced hypoxia establishes a “hypoxic secretome”, which initiates the migratory phenotype; the hypoxic secretome then cooperate with intracellular signaling networks to independently maintain cell migration. We propose three independent but inter-related aims to link hypoxic secretome with the initiation, maintenance and spatial distribution of migratory phenotypes. Aim 1 will engineer size-controlled DCIS organoids (150-600 µm) with controlled hypoxic microenvironments to identify and examine how hypoxic secretome initiates migratory phenotype. We will combine experimental organoid models with time-lapse imaging and computational approaches to study organoid migration. Aim 2 will demonstrate that migratory cells can re-establish the secretome and maintain migratory phenotype independent of hypoxia. We will reconstruct an intracellular signaling network activated by the hypoxic secretome using microarray data. We will verify these gene expression signatures in sorted migratory and non-migratory cells, and validate them using secretome inhibition studies. Aim 3 will investigate, for the first time, the spatial distribution and origin of the migratory phenotype. We will use CRISPR-based gene knock-in (FP-labeling), automated image analyses, and a deep-learning algorithm to track and visualize the emergence of migratory phenotypes from the hypoxic core outward to the periphery or from the migratory front. The successful development of this 3D organoid model and completion of the proposed work will provide answers to two fundamental questions in the progression of invasive breast cancer: 1) What causes some DCIS cells to become migratory and develop into invasive tumors? 2) How and where does the migratory phenotype (IDC) emerge? The mechanistic understanding gained from these studies will improve diagnosis, lead to the development of treatment strategies to arrest invasion at the pre-malignant stage, and thus prevent patient overtreatment. It is straightforward to generalize our system to other tumor types, development of tumor/stromal co-culture, and drug screening. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of death in women. Lack of mechanistic understanding on how a breast cancer in situ develops into malignant invasive breast cancer contributes to growing problem of both overtreatment and undertreatment. To address this, we propose to develop three-dimensional organoid model using cell lines and primary patient-derived cells. Based on existing studies and our own preliminary studies, we hypothesize that organoid size-induced hypoxia and secretome factors work cooperatively to initiate and maintain the migratory phenotype. We will use integrated bioengineering, computational and imaging approaches to test this hypothesis and discover novel druggable targets to stop emergence of migratory phenotype.",Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression,9605321,R37CA232209,"['Algorithms ', ' Biomedical Engineering ', ' bioengineering ', ' bio-engineers ', ' bio-engineered ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Carcinoma in Situ ', ' in situ cancer ', ' Preinvasive Carcinoma ', ' Intraepithelial Carcinoma ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' DCIS ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' cell motility ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Fibronectins ', ' alpha 2-Surface Binding Glycoprotein ', ' Opsonic alpha(2)SB Glycoprotein ', ' Opsonic Glycoprotein ', ' Large External Transformation-Sensitive Protein ', ' LETS Proteins ', ' Fibronectin 1 ', ' FN1 ', ' Cold-Insoluble Globulins ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mammography ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Organoids ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pleural effusion disorder ', ' pleural cavity effusion ', ' Pleural Effusion ', ' Proteins ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ', ' proto-oncogene protein c-erbB-1 ', ' erbBl ', ' erbB-1 Proto-Oncogene Protein ', ' erbB-1 ', ' c-erbB-1 Protein ', ' c-erbB-1 ', ' Urogastrone Receptor ', ' Transforming Growth Factor alpha Receptor ', ' TGF-alpha Receptor ', ' HER1 ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor-Urogastrone Receptors ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinase ', ' Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Kinase ', ' ERBB Protein ', ' EGFR ', ' EGF Receptor ', ' Risk ', ' Signal Pathway ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' E-Cadherin ', ' Uvomorulin ', ' Epithelial-Cadherin ', ' Epithelial Calcium-Dependent Adhesion Protein ', ' Cadherin-1 ', ' Vimentin ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Experimental Models ', ' base ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Left ', ' Peripheral ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Characterization of Emca4, the Rat Ortholog of the 8q24 Breast Cancer Risk Locus Project Summary The ultimate goal of this research is to define the mechanisms through which specific endocrine and genetic risk factors contribute to breast cancer development. The focus of this proposed study is Emca4, a genetic determinant of susceptibility to 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced mammary cancer in the rat that has been mapped to rat chromosome 7 (RNO7). Data presented herein indicate that Emca4 harbors multiple genetic determinants of mammary cancer susceptibility that are orthologous to breast cancer risk loci mapped to chromosome 8q24.21. Also presented are novel data that indicate that a risk prediction model based on genotype across the Emca4 orthologous regions in the human genome can accurately distinguish cases from controls in a previously characterized case/control cohort. The primary objectives of this proposed study are to identify the cell types in which and the mechanisms through which the Emca4 variants influence development of mammary cancer. The knowledge gained will be translate to studies of human derived biospecimens to assess relevance of the data emerging from the rat models. Aim 1 is to define the mechanisms through which Emca4.1 determines susceptibility to E2-induced mammary cancer. The genes upon which the Emca4.1 variants act will be identified in defined mammary cell populations. Aim 2 is to define the mechanism through which Emca4.4 influences mammary cancer susceptibility and modifies the actions of Emca4.1. The molecular bases of the epistatic interactions between Emca4.4 and Emca4.1 on mammary cancer susceptibility and the cellular and molecular phenotypes regulated by Emca4.4 and Emca4.1 will be defined.

"Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose that collagen features, such as alignment, fiber straightness and width, and other features of extracellular matrix composition can be used as an early biomarker of breast cancer. It is the goal of this proposal to determine the range of collagen structural features that characterize normal, benign and early disease, to determine how these features relate to mammographic density, and to identify the features that best predict risk, recurrence, and progression. This proposal leverages a diverse collaborative team that includes experts in imaging and understanding the tumor microenvironment, breast surgery, experts in population health and biostatistics, and an expert in proteomic analysis of the ECM. This team will analyze a set of patient cohorts to develop imaging and analysis of collagen structure and ECM composition as a potential early biomarker for breast cancer. Aims: 1) Characterize collagen features that define heterogeneity of the normal state. 2) Characterize collagen features in pre- and early breast cancer lesions. 3) Characterize the proteomics of biopsies representing benign, at risk, and invasive breast cancer. Significance: This project meets the goals of the RFA to develop and validate combined imaging and biomarker approaches to improve early cancer detection and the diagnosis of early-stage cancers. Our findings have the potential to reduce overdiagnosis and false positives and discern lethal from non-lethal disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The widespread adoption of screening mammography throughout the 1980s and 1990s led to a reduction in breast cancer mortality as more women were diagnosed at an earlier stage of disease and could be more successfully treated. Apart from their use in visualizing the tumor, mammograms are quantifiable based on the density of the signal in the image, which is based on the absorbance of x-rays by cells and the filamentous protein collagen. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and in the breast is present as a scaffolding network that supports the milk-secreting epithelial cells of this gland. In non-diseased breasts, the mammographic density is a function of the amount of collagen present, and is highly correlated to a 4-6 fold increased risk of developing breast cancer in the future. Mammographic density has been deemed so important that over a dozen states have recently passed legislation requiring physicians to inform patients of this value. However, the problem is that mammographic density does not predict survival once a tumor has been detected. Thus, although we have improved our detection of breast cancers, we do not have the ability to sort patients into groups where disease progresses from those that do not. Our current paradigm of treating everyone aggressively needs to change to a targeted plan of treating only those women at risk of future life-threatening disease. It is our hypothesis that it is not the overall macroscpic amount of collagen present, but rather the structure and organization of collagen at the local level which predicts cancer progression. We will examine tissue samples from a variety of non-diseased human patient cohorts, with the goal of discovering a biomarker for disease progression based on collagen structure. This will be done non-invasively by imaging slides that are already routinely prepared using a technique called second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy which selectively images collagen. We have advanced software which will measure the length, width, straightness, density and orientation of fibers that we can use to analyze tens of thousands of collagen fibers from dozens of images per sample. This high level of quantitation improves our statistical ability to discover the underlying biomarker from the noise. By understanding the normal non-diseased state, we can apply this knowledge to very early cancer stages in order to sort patients into aggressive and non-aggressive therapy groups. As a compliment to these studies, we will also determine the protein composition of the collagen matrix, as there are dozens of other proteins present. Preliminary data has shown changes in the makeup of proteins found in normal tissue compared to breast cancer, implying that the change in collagen structure is related to the underlying expression of proteins there. Through our proposed experiments, we will establish what a truly ""normal"" collagen matrix looks like in terms of structure and composition.",Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for

"Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk Project Summary/Abstract Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women at the age of 40 and older. Mammography has been used as a low-cost screening tool for breast cancer. The recent controversy on breast cancer screening recommendations has increased public awareness and interests for informed counseling of screening and health care options based on individualized estimates of risk. The goal of this proposed project is to develop a computerized image-based biomarker to assess the breast cancer risk of individual patients in the screening population. The innovation of our approach lies in the fact that the quantitative breast parenchyma descriptor (q-BPD) will be designed to take into account not only the percentage of dense tissue (PD) but also the stromal and epithelial structural pattern of an individual's breast that is complementary to, rather than a surrogate of, the breast density. The q-BPD is obtained by a joint analysis of the complexity of the parenchymal distribution pattern (mammographic parenchymal pattern, MPP) and the amount of dense tissue (PD) as they are imaged on full-field digital mammograms (FFDMs). We hypothesize that the proposed q-BPD is an independent risk factor for breast cancer and will have a stronger predictive power than previous approaches such as PD or BI-RADS density categories alone. To test the hypothesis, we have the following specific aims: (1) to collect a matched case-control data set of 500 breast cancer cases and 2000 matched controls with 5 years of prior FFDMs (prior to cancer diagnosis for the case group). We will split the entire data set into independent subsets for training and validation; (2) to design a q-BPD by using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to maximize the discriminatory power at the personal level; (3) to investigate the association of developed q-BPD with breast cancer risk in comparison with commonly used density descriptors, such as radiologist's estimates of BI-RADS density categories and interactive PD on FFDMs by case-control studies and statistical analyses, taking into account other confounding risk factors. When fully developed, the automated q-BPD can be incorporated as a part of routine breast cancer screening. It will not only be useful for breast cancer risk prediction for individual patients but also for monitoring of risk regression or progression over time due to treatment or other factors. The new risk prediction tool is expected to play a key role in personalized breast cancer screening for women at different risk levels, thereby reducing health care costs while benefiting high risk women. The success of this project will lay the foundation for future large-scale clinical trials to address the limitations and investigate the clinical utilities of the proposed q-BPD for breast cancer risk prediction. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed quantitative descriptor of breast parenchyma (q-BPD) can serve as a cost-effective biomarker to assist in stratification of screening strategy for individuals, follow-up, risk management, and monitoring of preventive treatment of high-risk women or interventional treatment of breast cancer patients, as well as for research and development of new treatment regimens. This will be a step towards the development of personalized medicine and reducing the overall health care costs.",Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk,9537234,U01CA195599,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Counseling ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Joints ', ' Mammography ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk Management ', ' Hospital Risk Reporting ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution ', ' Tissue Distribution ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Training ', ' Epithelial ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' radiologist ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' Descriptor ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Contralateral ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' cancer risk ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Gail model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Treatment ', ' Stratification ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Collection ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' modeling of the data ', ' model the data ', ' model of data ', ' data modeling ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' individual patient ', ' cancer markers ', ' cancer biomarkers ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2018,377811,0.40022095141270914
"Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) tend to be less responsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy than ER-negative breast cancers; advanced ER+ breast cancer remains largely incurable. Moreover, this breast cancer subtype frequently exhibits marked dormancy, conferring upon patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that persists for decades after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Why ER+ breast is the most strongly associated with dormancy is unknown and represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Since 70% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are ER+ but ~50% of these eventually recur, many doing so years after cessation of an otherwise apparently successful initial intervention, significance of the dormant phenotype is clear. Using transcriptome data from pretreatment tumors from women with ER+ breast cancer who were subsequently treated with tamoxifen (TAM) as their only systemic therapy, we derived an initial molecular classifier that robustly separates early (d 3 yrs) from late (e 5 yrs; emergence from dormancy) distant recurrences in both training and independent datasets. We then identified novel features of the ""early"" (E) vs. ""late"" (L) signaling network's topology in thse datasets. We also developed an adaptation of the DMBA-induced rat mammary tumor model and show that it represents E, L, and ""not"" (N) recurring tumors, molecular features of which are present in human breast tumors and cell lines. Mechanistically, our data implicate a ""rewiring"" (including epigenetic events) of the signaling from the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, and adaptations in cellular metabolism, as the molecular events that may enable cells to maintain, and later escape from, dormancy. Our central hypothesis is that dormancy reflects the growth arrest induced by endocrine therapies in both residual tumors (in-breast recurrences) and micro-metastases (distant recurrences), and that the signaling maintaining dormancy after systemic therapy ends is epigenetically regulated. Indeed, prolonged hormone therapy may well work by extending dormancy. Individual cells can emerge from dormancy as their metabolic capacity becomes sufficient to support both survival and replication, and the integrated balance between autophagy (prosurvival) and apoptosis (prodeath) signaling enables more cells in a tumor to proliferate and the tumor population size to grow. We propose an integrated, multidisciplinary research program that, if successful, will generate innovative insights into the molecular drivers of dormancy in ER+ breast cancers, develop new in silico signaling models, identify predictors of patient risk to experience a late recurrence, and explore mechanisms of dormancy with the longer term goal of discovering potentially novel therapeutic interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) comprise 70% of all newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers. ER+ breast tumors represent the breast cancer subtype most strongly associated with tumor dormancy, conferring upon these patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that can persist for decades after initial diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, very little is known abou the molecular drivers that determine the onset, maintenance, and emergence from dormancy. Our multidisciplinary team will apply state-of-the-art technologies to several unique, independent, human breast cancer data sets (including matched primary and recurrent tumors from the same individuals) and a rat mammary tumor model to address two fundamental aspects of dormancy; i.e., we will (i) accurately and robustly identify those breast cancer patients at greatest risk of experiencing a late recurrence (e 5 yrs after initial diagnosis) and (i) define the molecular events driving dormancy to help develop new treatment strategies that can be targeted to these patients.",Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology,9550931,U01CA184902,"['dimethylbenzanthracene ', ' dimethylbenz(a)anthracene ', ' DMBA ', ' Adenocarcinoma ', ' Malignant Adenoma ', '

"Quantitative MRI Radiomics of Breast Cancer in Assessment of Malignancy and Response to Therapy Project Summary We propose to introduce and optimize a new method of radiomics extraction via transfer learning with deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and to compare it to the conventional segmentation-based radiomics approach on breast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images (DCE-MRIs). The field of breast radiomics has been expanding fast, with many clinical conclusions being successfully derived from medical images using qualitative analysis. In the past couple of years, deep learning has experienced explosive growth in image recognition, easily solving complex problems. Deep CNNs achieve remarkable classification results on everyday image datasets. We propose to investigate the utility of deep neural networks with regards to the medical image datasets, specifically on the breast DCE-MRI dataset. Given the relatively small sizes of these datasets, CNNs previously trained on non-medical images will be utilized for clinical classifications as feature extractors. We will investigate multiple parameters involved in the CNN feature extraction methodology and their effect on classification performance. Two clinical tasks will be studied under the proposed research: 1) malignancy assessment and 2) response to therapy prediction. The optimized CNN method will be compared to and combined with the conventional segmentation- based radiomics method. Furthermore, we aim to investigate the robustness of the segmentation-based features across MR scanners of different manufacturers. The first aim of the proposed research will study the robustness of the segmentation- based features extracted from images acquired on MR scanners of two different manufacturers. The robustness will be investigated under four clinical tasks, such as lymph node involvement and receptor statuses. The second aim will be focused on optimization of CNN feature extraction and subsequent classifier design. Lastly, under the third aim we will compare and combine the CNN and segmentation-based radiomics in the classification tasks of malignancy assessment and response to therapy prediction. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed research is to improve breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis based on dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images by introducing novel deep learning methods to medical image classification and combining it with the conventional radiomics systems. The incredible power of deep learning methods to classify everyday images shows great promise to make predictions based on medical image datasets.

"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer. The functionality of the software will substantially transcend limitations of current analysis of cancer images, and will open the way for more precise and effective surgical planning as well as for more specific diagnosis of cancer based on its imaging characteristics, eventually leading to individualized medicine.",Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast

"A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis The long-term goal of this project is to develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis, thus aiding in improving the quality of both cancer research and clinical practice. Since diagnostic errors can cause altered treatment recommendations and significant patient harm, tools that semi-automate the diagnostic process to improve efficiency, reliability and accuracy are thus needed by both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. Our work will produce a set of machine-learning tools to identify regions of interest (ROI), classify these regions into the full spectrum of diagnostic categories (ranging from benign, to pre-invasive/risk lesions, to invasive cancer), and culminate in the development of a unified software package for cancer diagnosis that can be shared among cancer researchers and clinicians. Our aims are: Aim 1: Regions of Interest. Produce 1a) a ROI finder classifier and associated tools for use by researchers or pathologists for automatic identification of potential ROIs on whole slide images of breast biopsy slides and 1b) a ROI analysis classifier and associated tools that can point out image regions that tend to cause misdiagnosis and produce suitable warnings as to why such regions may either be distractors or indicate cancer. Aim 2: Diagnosis. Produce a diagnostic classifier and associated tools that can not only suggest the potential diagnosis of a whole slide image, but can also produce the reasons for the diagnosis in terms of regions on the image, their color, their texture, and their structure. Aim 3: Dissemination. Develop a unified software package containing this suite of tools, so they can be easily shared and provided (standalone and through the existing PIIP platform) to both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. In addition to specific classifiers for breast cancer research, we will provide the methodology to train related classifiers for other biopsy- diagnosed cancers, such as melanoma, prostate, lung, and colon cancer. Our highly innovative diagnostic tools will include our state-of-the-art (2017) feature extraction and machine learning methods as opposed to the generic image management tools of the current ITCR projects. Our classifiers were trained on a unique data set acquired in a carefully designed breast cancer research study, so they are immediately useful in the breast cancer domain, but designed to be easily retrained for other data sets and cancers. The addition of our unique multi-disciplinary team and these tools to the ITCR program will be an important aid to cancer research and will improve the process of diagnosis for clinicians.

"SCH: EXP: Improving early detection and intervention of lymphedema  Many breast cancer survivors face long-term post-operative challenges as a result of suffering from breast cancer related lymphedema (hereafter, lymphedema), which causes abnormal swelling and multiple distressing and sometimes extremely painful symptoms. These symptoms have been linked to clinically detrimental outcomes, such as disability and psychological distress, both of which are known risk factors for breast cancer survivors' poor quality of life. More importantly, lymphedema symptoms may indicate an early stage of lymphedema that constitutes only minimal changes in objective measures of limb volume. Without timely intervention in this early disease stage, lymphedema can progress into a chronic condition that no surgical or medical interventions at present can cure. Yet, current clinical practice largely relies on clinicians' observation of swelling and current research methods for detecting and assessing lymphedema are cumbersome and not effective in detecting early stage of lymphedema. Thus, early detection of lymphedema based on symptoms and early intervention for lymphedema symptom management may play an important role in reducing the patient's risk for chronic lymphedema. The first primary goal of this project is to use machine learning to understand the association between symptoms and other relevant personal and clinical factors and the presence of lymphedema, and develop a web-based self-assessment platform that enables patients to assess their risk for lymphedema from anywhere. The second goal is to develop a Kinect-sensor based training system to improve the effectiveness of training for patients to learn and practice the intervention lymphatic exercises developed by the Pl Fu, which have shown great promise in reducing the risk of chronic lymphedema by maintaining pre-surgery limb volume, and relieving lymphedema symptoms. The proposed solutions empower breast cancer survivors to take control of their progression path of lymphedema, and will be integrated into our current IT-based self-care platform for lymphedema symptom management and lymphedema risk reduction, which focuses on preventive, proactive, evidence-based, person-centered approach to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Lymphedema, which causes multiple painful symptoms, is a major health problem that affects more than 40% of 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in the US. This project will develop a self-assessment platform for . early detection of lymphedema and a Kinect-based exercise training system to enhance early intervention. The project has the potential to relieve lymphedema symptoms and reduce the risk for chronic lymphedema.

"Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers of Treatment Response and Prognosis in Breast Cancer ABSTRACT Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Around 20% to 30% of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer will have a recurrence and may eventually die of their disease. Currently, there are no reliable methods to identify which cancers will recur on an individual basis. Because of this, adjuvant therapies are given to nearly all patients with breast cancer, but benefit only a small proportion. A similar dilemma exists for neoadjuvant treatment, many patients fail to pathologically response to chemotherapy, and yet suffer from the associated toxicity. The conventional one-size-fits-all approach causes overtreatment, leading to morbidities and mortalities. To avoid these side effects, biomarkers that stratify patients with clinical relevance are critically needed for precision medicine in breast cancer. Molecular profiling is currently used to stratify breast cancer, but is limited by the requirement for invasive biopsy and confounded by intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity. Conversely, imaging provides a unique opportunity for the noninvasive interrogation of the tumor, its microenvironment, and invasion to surrounding normal tissues. We hypothesize that imaging characteristics reflect underlying tumor biology, and quantitative imaging features can provide independent valuable information, which are synergistic to known clinical, histologic, and genetic predictors. Accordingly, we have planned three specific aims to develop new quantitative imaging biomarkers for breast cancer, as well as clinically and biologically validate them. In Aim 1 we plan to develop automated computational tools to robustly quantify whole tumor, intratumor subregions, and parenchyma phenotypes from multimodal MRI. The curated breast cancer cohort (n=504) from our preliminary study will be analyzed, with available MRI scans and manually-delineated contours of tumor and parenchyma by board-certified radiologists. In Aim 2 we will build imaging feature-based models to predict recurrence-free survival and treatment response separately. By integrating with clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, the comprehensive models can predict clinical outcomes more accurately. The internal cohort (n=450) will be used for discovery, and the multi-center prospective cohort from I-SPY (n=186) will be used for validation. In Aim 3 we will elucidate the biological underpinnings behind our newly identified prognostic and predictive imaging biomarkers, by correlating them with biospecimen-derived phenotypes from the same tumor. In particular, we will investigate multi-omics molecular data as well as tumor morphology from H&E stained pathology slides. Three cohorts will be analyzed, including our internal cohort (n=450), the I-SPY cohort (n=186), and the TCGA cohort (n=1095). For three proposed aims, we have carried preliminary studies to prove the feasibility. By leveraging the richness of available well-annotated data and advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, it will increase the likelihood of success. Our proposed research will point new biomarkers of high value to better predict recurrence and treatment response at the individual level, and lead to better treatment decisions for women with breast cancer. Narrative This project aims to augment the imaging role in the personalized management of breast cancer, by developing automated tools to extract quantitative imaging biomarkers from both tumor and parenchyma, as well as evaluating the biological and clinical relevance of these imaging biomarkers. The new imaging biomarkers will work synergistically with the existing clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, to better stratify breast cancer patients and guide individualized therapy. Together, these will promote a major paradigm shift of MR imaging role and allow it serve as an important approach in personalized cancer management.",Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers of Treatment Response and Prognosis in Breast Cancer,9526827,K99CA218667,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Eosine Yellowish ', ' Tetrabromofluorescein ', ' Eosin ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histology ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K24 proposal combines mentoring in patient oriented cancer control research; research to translate evidence-based shared decision-support for screening mammography to the clinic; and career development in Implementation Science. The PI, Dr. Elizabeth Burnside, has been an influential mentor throughout her career at the University of Wisconsin (UW), fostered by leadership positions like her role as the co-lead of the Cancer Control Program in the UW NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Her mentoring and research both promote team science, which unites medical and ""translational"" disciplines like informatics, engineering, and population health, all areas for which she has expertise and departmental affiliate appointments. This award would carve out the necessary time for her to build a platform on which to formalize her mentoring approach and a curriculum to support a cadre of physician/scientists developing decision support tools aimed for clinical translation. This proposal takes advantage of a successful Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) funded at UW in 2006, committed to mentoring, patient oriented team science, and translational research. The aims included in this proposal are closely aligned with the UW CTSA -KL2 and other institutional training grants and fully leverage the rich mentoring and career development resources.  The patient oriented scientific aims proposed arise from healthcare shortfalls that she, a radiologist practicing in breast imaging, sees every day in clinic. They buid on her NCI funded R01 which asks the question: How can decision support in the clinic help healthcare providers optimize breast cancer screening and diagnosis in aging women? Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women = 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized strategies are needed to decrease morbidity and mortality, while minimizing harms (false positives and overdiagnosis-the detection of cancer that would not go on to cause symptoms or death). Though validated decision aids currently exist, immense opportunities still remain: personalization, integration in the clinical workflow, and implementation with high fidelity; all goals of this proposal. Personalized decision support tools will only be useful if they are thoughtfully designed and rigorously implemented.  Both her scientific aims and her career development plans integrate the new discipline of Implemenation Science. These methodologies will enable her to translate advances into an EMR-embedded decision tool for improved breast cancer screening decision-making for women = 65 and their physicians. Innovation is substantial; creating a tool that incorporates national simulation models to accurately convey outcomes that is integrated into the EMR has not been done. This award will enable Dr. Burnside to become an influential mentor of clinician-scientists using implementation science to advance personalized decision support into the clinic. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to build a mentorship program for clinicians who are developing tools that use a patient's unique characteristics to help make optimal health care decisions. The proposed research exemplifies this important goal by using the newest scientific techniques to develop and test a personalized decision tool to help women age 65 or over decide (with their physician) whether to undergo breast cancer screening. By combining mentoring, research, and new scientific methodologies, this plan will powerfully translate the science of personalized prediction to patients to help make decisions that are right for them.",Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis,9495679,K24CA194251,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Award ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Influentials ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Psychologist ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Decision Aid ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' radiologist ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' cancer care ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Resource Development ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' CISNET ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' implementation science ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' surveillance network ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' mammography screening ', ' Mammographic screening ', ' mammary imaging ', ' breast imaging ', ' support tools ', ' individualized strategies ', ' personalized strategies ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' personalized decision ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' clinical translation ', ' Individualized risk prediction ', ' personalized risk prediction ', ' personalized predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' personalized predictions ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K24,2018,322232,0.27588535688574367
"Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Molecular Imaging for Breast Lesion Characterization PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Claiming more than 40,000 lives in the United States in 2015, breast cancer presents an important health focus. Mammography and ultrasound, current screening methods, suffer from low sensitivity and low positive predictive value, respectively, particularly in patients with dense breast tissues. Therefore, a non-invasive method of distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions that could be incorporated with current screening modalities is critically needed. With more advanced screening methods, there is an increase in the detection of early malignant lesions, for which breast-conserving treatment has become more routine. However, intraoperative frozen-section margin assessment is time consuming and suffers from low sensitivity, while post-operative histological analysis leaves potential for positive margins, strongly correlated with reoccurrence. Therefore, a real-time method to detect tumor margins intraoperatively is critically needed. We propose using spectroscopic photoacoustic and fluorescence molecular imaging combined with a clinically- translatable contrast agent targeted to a novel breast cancer marker (B7-H3) to non-invasively distinguish normal from malignant tissues both during screening (aim 1) and intraoperatively during surgical resection (aim 3). The sensitivity of this imaging method will be increased with the use of machine learning post-processing algorithms to autonomously detect molecular B7-H3 signal (aim 2). In summary, this proposal will result in significant change to current clinical breast imaging and surgical resection practice to improve the detection and treatment of focal breast lesions. The training portion of this plan, required to accomplish these research goals, has been designed with trainee mentors with specific technical expertise. Dr. Willmann is an expert in translational molecular imaging and contrast agent use, while Dr. Rubin is an expert in bioinformatics, image processing, and machine learning for medical imagine purposes. Additionally, the project is supported by a diverse advisory committee with experts in clinical breast imaging (Dr. Debra Ikeda), optical imaging and intraoperative guidance (Dr. Christopher Contag), and clinical breast surgery (Dr. Irene Wapnir). To date, the candidate has developed expertise in photoacoustic, ultrasound, and fluorescence molecular imaging and molecular contrast agent development and in vivo use during her graduate and postdoctoral research. Her long term career goals include developing clinically translatable combined spectroscopic photoacoustic and fluorescence molecular imaging methods combined with novel contrast agents for cancer detection and differentiation. Additionally, her research will focus on developing machine learning algorithms for increasing the sensitivity of the molecular imaging approach as well as adapting her method for therapeutic purposes. In preparation for her independent research career, the training plan includes formal education in machine learning, digital signal processing, optical imaging, and cancer biology, as well as in career development classes and ethical conduct of research. Narrative Mammography and ultrasound used for breast cancer screening suffer from low sensitivity and low positive predictive value in women with dense breast tissue (40%). Here, combined spectroscopic photoacoustic and fluorescence molecular imaging used with a clinically-translatable contrast agent targeted to a novel breast cancer marker and novel machine learning based spectral recognition algorithms are explored for noninvasive differentiation between benign and malignant lesions and for intraoperative tumor margin assessment. The project is supported by excellent mentors, Drs. Willmann and Rubin, and a diverse advisory committee, Drs. Contag, Ikeda, and Wapnir, and proposes an extended training plan including formal and informal learning opportunities, to aid the PI on her transition to independent faculty.",Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Molecular Imaging for Breast Lesion Characterization,9491822,K99EB023279,"['absorption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' DCIS ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Contrast Media ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Digital Signal Processing ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Faculty ', ' Female ', ' Fluorescence ', ' Fluorescent Dyes ', ' fluorescent dye/probe ', ' Fluorescent Agents ', ' Fluorescence Agents ', ' Frozen Sections ', ' Freeze Sectioning ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hyperplasia ', ' Hyperplastic ', ' Indocyanine Green ', ' Wofaverdin ', ' Ujoveridin ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Mammography ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Noise ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Specificity ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Combination FGFR4 and ER-Targeted Therapy for Invasive Lobular Carcinoma Project Summary Even though invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) accounts for 10-15% of the breast cancer seen in the US, there remains much to be learned about the unique nature of this disease. For example, patients with ILC are likely to have tumors with expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ER), a biomarker of good prognosis. Yet, patients with ER+ ILC have worse long-term outcomes compared to patients with the more commonly studied subtype of ER+ invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). The standard treatment regimen for ER+ disease includes endocrine therapy, so the big picture focus of this grant asks: why do some ILC patients have a worse outcome than expected on endocrine therapy, and for those patients, what additional treatments can we provide? This grant aims to assess the effect of FGFR4 expression on cell survival and signaling in vitro, identify biomarkers for FGFR4 activation in silico, and test the efficacy of FGFR4 inhibition on clinical samples ex vivo.

"Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy Project Abstract More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. BBD is associated with increases in BC risk, ranging from 1.5-2.0 times for least severe categories to fourfold for most severe types. However, these risks apply to groups of women, not individuals, and individual risk varies considerably within BBD categories. Further, we have shown that breast cancer (BC) risk prediction models, such as the “Gail Model”, perform poorly among women with BBD. Previously, we developed the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies, which provides individual risk estimates based on self-reported factors, detailed characteristics of BBD extent and severity, and assessment of involution (shrinkage and disappearance) of surrounding histologic structures (terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs)) from which most BC precursors arise. BBD-BC outperforms the Gail Model in predicting BC risk. However, given that radiologically-guided small (percutaneous) biopsies have largely replaced surgical biopsies for diagnosis, a new model based on this biopsy approach is needed. Further, the emergence of mammographic density as an important BC risk factor, development of novel methods to assess TDLU involution and increased use of biomarkers in routinely processed clinical samples offer an opportunity to develop an improved BC risk prediction tool for women with percutaneous biopsy diagnoses of BBD. The goal of this project is to build a BC risk prediction tool for women with BBD diagnosed on percutaneous needle biopsy that could be validated in diverse populations and implemented clinically. We propose to develop a cohort at Mayo that includes >7,000 women who were diagnosed with BBD on a percutaneous biopsy of whom >400 later developed BC. We will develop a model to predict BC that includes factors in the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies. We will also assess mammographic density, measured as a volume and area, using validated methods. We will identify immunohistochemical markers that can be applied to BBD biopsies to predict future risk of developing BC and evaluate novel NanoString RNA assays, which measure expression of related genes as composite “signatures” reflecting cancer-like characteristics, proliferation, and a mutation-like score for the important TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Finally, we will develop an epidemiologic “case-cohort” that includes a random subset of women from the full cohort (n~500) and all the women that developed invasive BC (n~250). We will evaluate BC risk prediction in this case-cohort of 750 women to evaluate performance of risk models without biomarkers and with biomarkers using novel machine learning approaches that offer strengths compared with more typical statistical models. Using these data, we will build an absolute risk prediction model for the full cohort that can be tested in other populations. Project Narrative More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. Although routine pathology diagnoses stratify groups of women with BBD into different levels of BC risk, individual risks vary greatly within these categories. Leveraging discoveries in prior work that resulted in a predictive model for BBD diagnosed on surgical biopsies, we will build a new model for percutaneous biopsies (now the dominant sampling method), which incorporates mammographic density, novel tissue biomarkers and machine learning statistical approaches.",Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy,9578200,R01CA229811,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' Needle biopsy procedure ', ' needle biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Breast Diseases ', ' mammary disorder ', ' Breast Disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cox Models ', ' Cytokeratin 8 ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Trees ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' TP53 gene ', ' p53 Genes ', ' Tumor Protein p53 Gene ', ' TRP53 ', ' TP53 ', ' P53 ', ' Tumor Suppressor Genes ', ' oncosuppressor gene ', ' Tumor Suppressing Genes ', ' Recessive Oncogenes ', ' Oncogenes-Tumor Suppressors ', ' Onco-Suppressor Genes ', ' Emerogenes ', ' Cancer Suppressor Genes ', ' Antioncogenes ', ' Anti-Oncogenes ', ' Measures ', ' forest ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Surgical Models ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Terminal Ductal Lobular Unit ', ' TDLU ', ' Breast Cancer Model ', ' mammary tumor model ', ' mammary cancer model ', ' Breast tumor model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Gail model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' mammographic breast density ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' senescent ', ' senescence ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' nanostring ', ' nano-string ', ' screening ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' immunohistochemical biomarkers ', ' immunohistochemical markers ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2018,640367,0.1504502724838877
"3-D modeling-based decision support for optimizing quality of life following breast reconstruction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast reconstruction is a central component of the breast cancer treatment process for many women. The purpose of breast reconstruction is to recreate a breast form that is satisfying to the patient, facilitating her psychosocial adjustment o living as a breast cancer survivor. Decisions about breast reconstruction can be difficult and overwhelming for many women due to the number of options available and conflicting values and preferences. The long-term goal of our research is to enhance the consultation process for women undergoing breast reconstruction surgery. Our vision is a decision support system that will enable breast cancer patients, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to choose a reconstruction strategy with maximal potential to optimize psychosocial adjustment. This system for shared decision-making will use quantitative models to tailor the presentation of patient-specific information about breast reconstruction outcomes. Three common features of decision support systems are the knowledge base; the methodology for combining that knowledge with patient-specific information; and the communication mechanisms. With recent NIH support, we established a unique knowledge base through a longitudinal study of 500 women who underwent breast reconstruction. We also developed preliminary computational models for combining that knowledge base with patient-specific data. Our models are parameterized by experimental, clinical, and psychosocial data and employ techniques from 3D image analysis, biomechanical modeling and simulation, machine learning, and decision analysis. In the proposed project, we will develop predictive algorithms for combining the knowledge base and patient- specific information, and we will develop communication mechanisms both for gathering necessary patient- specific information and for delivering information about the decision basis to the patient and her multidisciplinary care team. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our vision is a decision support system that will enable breast cancer patients, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to choose a reconstruction strategy that will lead to maximal psychosocial adjustment.

"Deep interpretation of mammographic images in breast cancer screening Project Summary/Abstract Screening mammography has been shown effective in early detection of breast cancer and in reducing mortality. However, controversies and challenges still remain, with primary concerns on personal breast cancer risk prediction from mammographic parenchymal markers, high recall and benign biopsy rates, and improving radiologists’ clinical reading practices. Computerized methods have been developed in these regards, with the goal of providing computer assistance to radiologists in making clinical decisions. While successful, the accuracy of these methods is subject to appropriate data representation (i.e., image features) that requires strong feature engineering. A newly emerged artificial intelligence technique, called deep learning, represents a breakthrough in machine learning paradigms, and has revolutionized computer image analysis and many other applications in the past few years. Breast cancer screening yields a huge amount of mammogram data that requires in-depth interpretation to improve current clinical workup. The goal of this study is to develop and optimize a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based computational approach to improve mammographic imaging trait identification, analysis, and interpretation and to use this approach to address accurate breast cancer risk prediction and reduce false recall rates. This study will be the first to examine the effects of the revolutionary deep learning technique on performing in-depth interpretation of big screening mammogram data, aimed at improving clinical practice. The new risk biomarkers will contribute to providing more accurate risk prediction than currently available. The recall-decision model will help reduce false recalls (associated with potential benign biopsy results), and better understand radiologists’ reading behaviors. Overall, the CNN-based approach will optimize the clinical utility of screening mammography and has a high likelihood to translate to the clinic for breast cancer screening. Public Health Relevance Statement (Project Narrative): We propose to apply a revolutionary deep learning approach to mine a big data of digital mammograms for improving mammogram data analysis and interpretation. This study will provide a computer-aided deep learning toolkit for improving breast cancer risk prediction and for aiding individual radiologists in their clinical decision-making on recalls. By introducing this newly emerged powerful machine learning technique to the clinical side of breast cancer screening, it will contribute to improving personal breast cancer risk prediction and reducing unnecessary recalls.

"Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis PROJECT SUMMARY  The advent of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) or “3D mammography” brings promise of improved sensitivity and specificity. Even as DBT undergoes rapid clinical adoption, this new imaging modality poses new challenges to radiologists due to many differences in image appearance compared to conventional mammography. Recent studies and clinical experience show the urgent need for improved training in DBT. These changes necessitate dedicated training for both radiology residents and board-certified radiologists. The currently accepted training paradigm (i.e., the “one size fits all” approach) cannot effectively accommodate the individual needs of each radiologist-in-training. We propose to address this shortcoming.  This project seeks to develop a new paradigm of adaptive, computer-enhanced training in the interpretation of DBT. Using predictive algorithms similar to the recommendation systems of companies like Amazon and Netflix, our system will create a training environment tailored to the needs of each individual radiologist. We have shown that the radiologists-in-training do not make errors in a random manner; instead their error making demonstrates specific patterns. Even more importantly, those errors can be predicted from each individual’s previous interpretations. We propose to use machine learning-based user modeling as well as collaborative filtering algorithms to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each individual. Then, we will adapt the training protocol to the individual needs of the trainee in order to accelerate the training and improve his/her diagnostic skills in the areas that need improvement. The aims are: (1) develop user models that predict the difficulty of a DBT case based its image features and trainee performance, (2) implement an educational system that presents training cases that focus on the unique needs of each individual, and (3) conduct a reader study to validate the improved effectiveness of the proposed adaptive system.  This has work has the following key innovations. We propose the first ever computer-aided education system for residents and radiologists that is adaptive and individualized. We leverage cutting edge concepts from the fields of user modeling and collaborative filtering, which our lab has introduced to the field of medical imaging. This work addresses training limitations for the newly adopted modality of DBT.  This research has very high clinical significance: Improving training in the interpretation of breast images will ensure the greatest benefit of breast cancer screening. The proposed work, while developing a fully functional DBT education system, will contribute to the foundation for a more general, new paradigm of improved individualized education that extends to other image interpretation tasks and imaging modalities. This work is a collaboration between computer vision and machine learning experts, breast imaging radiologists, director of Radiology residency, a biostatistician, and a human factors expert. Our technology will be disseminated through a partnership with IMAIOS, a leading provider of online radiology education. Digital breast tomosynthesis is becoming a standard practice in breast cancer screening and there is a pressing need for effective education in this new modality. In this study we propose to develop a computer system for education in digital breast tomosynthesis that adapts itself to each trainee and to find an individualized training protocol that fits best the trainee’s needs. Such system could improve dramatically the time efficiency of training in digital breast tomosynthesis images and improve diagnostic performance of the trainees. This is likely to improve the overall effectiveness of breast cancer screening and, given high importance of breast cancer screening, decrease mortality rate of the disease.",Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis,9501713,R01EB021360,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breast ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computers ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' continuing medical education ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Hand ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Mammography ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residencies ', ' Rest ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' radiologist ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' case-based ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' clinical practice ', ' Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ', ' mammary imaging ', ' breast imaging ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,368596,0.2766951105647728
"Interactive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia Abstract This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using state-of-the-art voice- controlled intelligent assistants to deliver automated cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) for breast cancer survivors (BCS), who suffer from higher rates of insomnia than the general population. Insomnia has numerous detrimental health consequences and too few well- trained CBT-I therapists are available to offer treatment. The user will interact with voice recognition through spoken voice dialogs with an internet-connected speaker instead of a computer and keyboard. The long-term goal is to provide acceptable CBT-I with voice recognition instead of cumbersome, in-person visits or web-based, bright computer screens. In our specific aims, our multidisciplinary team will invite breast cancer survivors with insomnia to inform development of a voice-accessible prototype. We will build and debug the prototype before conducting feasibility testing to assess the prototype’s acceptability with BCS. The central hypothesis is that the majority of participants will report satisfaction with the intervention and express interest in using it for CBT-I at home. We also anticipate that participants will gain knowledge of CBT-I and insomnia treatment through interaction with the device. This intervention includes engaging and educational elements, and multiple areas of innovation which overcome current impediments to the delivery of scalable, automated CBT-I. We anticipate that the results will demonstrate feasibility, and will provide data to inform a Phase II study testing the efficacy of the CBT-I system on insomnia through a randomized controlled trial as well as more feedback on usability of the system throughout development. This contribution is significant, because successful completion of Phase I aims will demonstrate how this product might advance the effective implementation of an evidence-based therapy that can scale to the growing population of breast cancer survivors with insomnia who lack access to trained CBT-I therapists.

"A comprehensive liquid biopsy platform for detection and prognostication in early stage breast cancer Project Summary We seek to develop robust platforms for capturing, enumerating and analyzing circulating tumor cells and associated cancer cells from the blood of cancer patients. We will leverage our previously developed precisely engineered microfilter platform that allows effective separation and collection of viable CTC from patient blood. In parallel, we have developed novel imaging methods perfectly suited for rapid analyses for circulating tumor cells, clusters and associated cancer cell subtypes (such as Cancer Associated Fibroblasts, or CAF). We propose to integrate these two novel technologies to create a robust diagnostic tool for clinical pathology as well as basic research that enables capture, enumeration, and analyses of circulating tumor cells and associated cancer cells. Our multidisciplinary team proposes the following Specific Aims: 1) Build and validate the technology to rapidly acquire CTC/CAF images using Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy and evaluate the images with a deep learning algorithm  2) Evaluation of the integrated platform for using CTC/CAF in predicting recurrence/survival in early stage  breast cancer patients For these studies in early stage breast cancer, we have robust collaborations with industry partners in Circulogix Inc (Microfilter technology for cell capture), ClearBridge Inc. (FPM imaging of the microfilter surface), and Google Software (Deep learning algorithm for analyzing FPM images of microfilter). The ability to reliably and rapidly detect and analyze CTC and associated cancer cells in early stage breast cancer patients would deliver a major new tool for oncology research, a platform for screening of novel drugs, and a critical advance in precision cancer management.

"Spectral X-ray Volumetric Imaging for Enhanced Cancerous and Healthy Tissue Differentiation in Breast Tumor Specimens Abstract Clarix Imaging Corporation (Clarix) is focused on solving one of the largest problems in early stage breast cancer treatment, reoperations for positive margins. About 25% of the >200,000 patients who undergo lumpectomy in the US each year will face this additional procedure because current options for identifying positive margins intraoperatively are insufficient. Currently physicians rely on 2D specimen imaging for assessing margin status during surgery which cannot adequately represent the 3D margin morphology. Therefore, Clarix is developing a novel volumetric specimen imager, VSI, device that yields fully 3D images of the specimen with isotropic resolution which can significantly improve margin assessment and provide precise guidance for immediate re-excision before closing wound. We have previously demonstrated the ability of our VSI patented algorithms to overcome long scan times of conventional 3D imagers that would disrupt surgical workflow, and are now proposing development of a novel, algorithm-enabled spectral VSI system to further differentiate cancerous from healthy tissue. Recent developments by our founders allow for spectral CT with no special hardware. The addition of spectral imaging to our VSI system will enable automated cancer delineation in margin assessment improving surgical accuracy and pathologic assessment, and can also be applied to in vivo breast imaging. In the Phase I project we set out to demonstrate proof-of-concept of differentiation between breast tumors and healthy tissue using spectral image reconstruction tailored to VSI. The Specific Aims are to (1) create and validate simulated spectral VSI data of breast cancer specimens, (2) verify the robustness of the spectral VSI algorithm for breast cancer specimens, and (3) verify that spectral VSI can enable breast tumor delineation in patient specimens. Reaching the above Aims will firmly establish the feasibility of spectral CT for cancer differentiation further establishing Clarix VSI as the technical leader in the fast-growing specimen imaging market. Project Narrative Women who undergo lumpectomy for breast cancer have close to a 1 in 4 chance of needing a repeat operation because cancer was left in their breast. Providing surgeons with imaging tools in the operating room can increase rates of complete cancer removal in the first surgery. 2D mammograms of surgical specimens can already be taken in the operating room, but overlying tissue in a 2D image commonly masks the tumor. Clarix Imaging Corporation is developing 3D CT Volumetric Specimen Imager (VSI) to address these challenges providing surgeons with more actionable information. The focus of this project is to incorporate spectral imaging into the VSI to allow for increased differentiation between cancerous and healthy tissues.",Spectral X-ray Volumetric Imaging for Enhanced Cancerous and Healthy Tissue Differentiation in Breast Tumor Specimens,9847765,R43CA239930,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Carcinoma ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Epithelial cancer ', ' Chicago ', ' Radiopaque Media ', ' Contrast Drugs ', ' Contrast Agent ', ' Contrast Media ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Histology ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' image generation ', ' image construction ', ' image reconstruction ', ' indexing ', ' Investments ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Marketing ', ' Masks ', ' Mammectomy ', ' Mastectomy ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Palpation ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Physics ', ' Privatization ', ' Ramp ', ' Reoperation ', ' Repeat Surgery ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sales ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Specificity ', ' Staining method ', ' Stains ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' X-Ray Medical Imaging ', ' X-Ray Imaging ', ' Roentgenography ', ' Radiography ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray Radiology ', ' Diagnostic X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic Radiology ', ' Conventional X-Ray ', ' Diagnostic radiologic examination ', ' Xrays ', ' X-Rays Radiation ', ' X-Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' soft tissue ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Funding ', ' Imaging Phantoms ', ' Morphology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Adopted ', ' Dimensions ', ' Scanning ', ' Slide ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' Performance ', ' attenuation ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' breast lumpectomy ', ' Lumpectomy ', ' Local Excision Mastectomy ', ' Limited Resection Mastectomy ', ' Property ', ' cancer surgery ', ' 3D images ', ' 3D image ', ' 3-D image ', ' 3-D Images ', ' Three-Dimensional Image ', ' Address ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Breast Cancer Treatment ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Tissue Differentiation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' reconstruction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' wound ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' Cancerous ', ' commercial application ', ' tumor ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' operation ', ' Algorithmic Software ', ' Software Algorithm ', ' Algorithmic Tools ', ' contrast enhanced ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' spectrograph ', ' spectrum imagery ', ' spectrum image ', ' spectral imagery ', ' spectral image ', ' imaging capabilities ', ' imager ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' off-patent ', ' ']",NCI,CLARIX IMAGING CORPORATION,R43,2019,210171,0.25339162619957256
"A comprehensive liquid biopsy platform for detection and prognostication in early stage breast cancer Project Summary We seek to develop robust platforms for capturing, enumerating and analyzing circulating tumor cells and associated cancer cells from the blood of cancer patients. We will leverage our previously developed precisely engineered microfilter platform that allows effective separation and collection of viable CTC from patient blood. In parallel, we have developed novel imaging methods perfectly suited for rapid analyses for circulating tumor cells, clusters and associated cancer cell subtypes (such as Cancer Associated Fibroblasts, or CAF).

"Molecular Analysis of Residual Breast Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer death (PMID: 25651787). According to the WHO, breast cancer incidence rose 20% between 2008 and 2012, with 1.7M global diagnoses in 2012. More than 40,000 women died from breast cancer in the U.S. in 2016. Residual disease is important because breast cancer patients with positive margins have a high risk of recurrence and disease-specific mortality. Some studies indicate a surprisingly high risk from positive margins: patients with positive margins have a higher risk of recurrence than patients who have micrometastases to 10 lymph nodes. The elevated risk from positive margins continues to persist even in an era where lumpectomy patients are treated with radiotherapy and systemic therapies. In fact, the increased risk from positive margins is not reduced by additional chemo or a radiation boost. These findings underscore the continued importance of identifying positive margins, especially when clinical trial data will be used to evaluate emerging therapies or compare treatment efficacies. Improving the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer depends on clinical trials, which must account for confounding clinical variables like residual disease. Evidence-based medicine depends on the quality of the underlying data that are used to evaluate therapeutic options and perform comparative efficacy studies. Unfortunately, existing tests are not reliable enough to accurately and reproducibly detect residual disease. Inaccurate tests contribute to confusion and conflicting trial results. This goal of this project is to establish an improved test for residual breast cancer. This work builds on extensive development and validation of a panel of biomarkers that distinguishes tumors from healthy samples. This project will continue our transition from discovery platforms to a technology that is already widely used in clinical labs. Improved testing would improve clinical trials by identifying high-risk patients, allow researchers to ask fundamental questions about breast cancer treatments, and compare treatment efficacies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Detection of minimal residual disease for liquid tumors has undergone two revolutions: from microscopy to flow cytometry, and then from flow cytometry to nucleic acid tests. Each advance transformed clinical management. Meanwhile, detection of residual disease for solid tumors continues to rely on microscopic sectioning, which is not an ideal way to hunt for residual disease. This project will establish a research test that uses nucleic acids to detect residual tumor along the surface of surgical breast cancer specimens.",Molecular Analysis of Residual Breast Cancer,9778629,R43CA233107,"['Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Charge ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Confusion ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Freezing ', ' Glass ', ' Goals ', ' Immunohistochemistry Staining Method ', ' Immunohistochemistry Cell/Tissue ', ' Immunohistochemistry ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', ' lymph gland ', ' Lymph node proper ', ' Lymph Node Reticuloendothelial System ', ' lymph nodes ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' mortality ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' Patients ', ' Polylysine ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' tumor specific biomarker ', ' tumor biomarker ', ' TM-MKR ', ' Tumor Markers ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Blinded ', ' Titrations ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests ', ' Nucleic Acid Testing ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Surgical margins ', ' Licensing ', ' Residual Neoplasm ', ' Minimal Residual Disease ', ' Detectable Residual Disease ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Pathologist ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Evidence Based Medicine ', ' Cancer Vaccines ', ' vaccine for cancer ', ' Tumor Vaccines ', ' Neoplasm Vaccines ', ' Antineoplastic Vaccine ', ' Slide ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Residual Tumors ', ' residual disease ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' synergism ', ' Adjuvant Therapy ', ' Cell surface ', ' Touch sensation ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' breast lumpectomy ', ' Lumpectomy ', ' Local Excision Mastectomy ', ' Limited Resection Mastectomy ', ' Radiation ', ' Sampling ', ' Address ', ' Tumor Burden ', ' Tumor Load ', ' Mammary Neoplasms ', ' mammary tumor ', ' Mammary Cancer ', ' Breast Tumors ', ' Breast Neoplasms ', ' Breast Cancer Treatment ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Detection of Minimal Residual Disease ', ' Micrometastasis ', ' Micromets ', ' MICMET ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Research Contracts ', ' Resolution ', ' Systemic Therapy ', ' SYS-TX ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Tumor Biology ', ' Tumor Subtype ', ' Validation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' combinatorial ', ' chemotherapy ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' gene panel ', ' Therapeutic Trials ', ' vaccine trial ', ' vaccine study ', ' vaccination trial ', ' vaccination study ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' biomarker panel ', ' marker panel ', ' specific biomarkers ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' efficacy study ', ' rare cancer ', ' rare tumor ', ' rare malignancy ', ' cancers that are rare ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,"CLEAR GENE, INC.",R43,2019,274053,0.28892632807986107
"Home-based Virtual Reality System for the Treatment of Chemotherapy-related Cognitive Impairments PROJECT SUMMARY Objectives: To develop a computer-based cognitive training system for breast cancer survivors who are suffering from cognitive impairments subsequent to chemotherapy. A home-based system will be developed, targeting executive functions, attention and memory cognitive domains. The system will incorporate a novel low-cost biosensor device. Specific Aims: 1) Development, validation and usability evaluation of the integrative therapy system; 2) Feasibility study on breast cancer survivors with lasting cognitive impairments post chemotherapy. Methods: 1) Develop a biosensor system to detect cognitive load variation during game play; 2) Validation study of the biosensor prototype; 3) Develop therapeutic games with focus on cognitive intervention; 4) System integration; 5) Develop cloud-based database and remote monitoring software; 6) Conduct a usability study of the system with 4 individuals; 7) Sample standardized outcome measures at pre-treatment, post- treatment and at follow up on 12 breast cancer survivors post-chemotherapy. The primary outcome measures will be cognitive metrics of executive function (Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR), NAB Attention Module, Controlled Oral Word Association Test (CFL), Trail Making Test, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Revised (HVLT-R), Brief Visuospatial Memory Test, Revised (BVMT-R). One standard deviation difference in score will be considered a clinically important change. For attention primary outcomes will be NAB Digit Span and Dots for attention, and for memory HVLT-R and BVMT-R scores. Secondary outcomes will be biosensor data, game performance (scores, error rates, intensity of play), changes in activities of daily living, and depression severity (Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd Ed); 8) Conduct a feasibility clinical trial with 12 breast cancer survivors post chemotherapy and their 12 caregivers. The cancer survivors will be randomized into two groups: experimental treatment (n=6) and sham treatment (n=6). The treatment group will use the biosensor device with custom games, while the sham group will use a laptop with mock up headband with only occupancy/contact sensors. By detecting the wearing of the headband, sham group's total session time will be matched to the experimental group, detected and logged by computer software. 9) Analyze adherence to protocol and outcome data using descriptive and multivariate regression analysis to determine motor functional improvements, cognitive benefits and group changes in cognitive load. NIH Relevance: Current chemotherapy-based cancer treatments are associated with Chemobrain, namely mild cognitive impairments affecting long-term about a third of cancer survivors [Vannorsdall, 2017]. The proposed home-based cognitive intervention is an innovative medication- free approach, provided in the convenience of home. This increases access to care especially for those with illness or treatment-related fatigue. 8.

"Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers of Treatment Response and Prognosis in Breast Cancer ABSTRACT Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Around 20% to 30% of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer will have a recurrence and may eventually die of their disease. Currently, there are no reliable methods to identify which cancers will recur on an individual basis. Because of this, adjuvant therapies are given to nearly all patients with breast cancer, but benefit only a small proportion. A similar dilemma exists for neoadjuvant treatment, many patients fail to pathologically response to chemotherapy, and yet suffer from the associated toxicity. The conventional one-size-fits-all approach causes overtreatment, leading to morbidities and mortalities. To avoid these side effects, biomarkers that stratify patients with clinical relevance are critically needed for precision medicine in breast cancer. Molecular profiling is currently used to stratify breast cancer, but is limited by the requirement for invasive biopsy and confounded by intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity. Conversely, imaging provides a unique opportunity for the noninvasive interrogation of the tumor, its microenvironment, and invasion to surrounding normal tissues. We hypothesize that imaging characteristics reflect underlying tumor biology, and quantitative imaging features can provide independent valuable information, which are synergistic to known clinical, histologic, and genetic predictors. Accordingly, we have planned three specific aims to develop new quantitative imaging biomarkers for breast cancer, as well as clinically and biologically validate them. In Aim 1 we plan to develop automated computational tools to robustly quantify whole tumor, intratumor subregions, and parenchyma phenotypes from multimodal MRI. The curated breast cancer cohort (n=504) from our preliminary study will be analyzed, with available MRI scans and manually-delineated contours of tumor and parenchyma by board-certified radiologists. In Aim 2 we will build imaging feature-based models to predict recurrence-free survival and treatment response separately. By integrating with clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, the comprehensive models can predict clinical outcomes more accurately. The internal cohort (n=450) will be used for discovery, and the multi-center prospective cohort from I-SPY (n=186) will be used for validation. In Aim 3 we will elucidate the biological underpinnings behind our newly identified prognostic and predictive imaging biomarkers, by correlating them with biospecimen-derived phenotypes from the same tumor. In particular, we will investigate multi-omics molecular data as well as tumor morphology from H&E stained pathology slides. Three cohorts will be analyzed, including our internal cohort (n=450), the I-SPY cohort (n=186), and the TCGA cohort (n=1095). For three proposed aims, we have carried preliminary studies to prove the feasibility. By leveraging the richness of available well-annotated data and advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, it will increase the likelihood of success. Our proposed research will point new biomarkers of high value to better predict recurrence and treatment response at the individual level, and lead to better treatment decisions for women with breast cancer. Narrative This project aims to augment the imaging role in the personalized management of breast cancer, by developing automated tools to extract quantitative imaging biomarkers from both tumor and parenchyma, as well as evaluating the biological and clinical relevance of these imaging biomarkers. The new imaging biomarkers will work synergistically with the existing clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, to better stratify breast cancer patients and guide individualized therapy.

"Predictive Modeling of the EGFR-MAPK pathway for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients The EGFR-MAPK pathway is a key signaling pathway in human Triple Negative Beast Cancers (TNBC). We propose to leverage genomic and proteomic data from a rich animal model system, and 2 human clinical trials, to build predictive models of the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway activity for TNBC patients. The heterogeneity of TNBC has hindered previous development of predictive pathway-based computational models because most approaches are based on experimental data from a single cell line or animal model that is then extrapolated to fit multiple tumor subtypes. Our approach is to use a diverse experimental model system that reflects the heterogeneous disease subtypes, and then use two distinct and complementary methods to build the computational model. We will simultaneously use mechanistic and statistical modeling approaches, at a variety of scales, that incorporate data from drug treated tumors and cell lines, assayed for gene expression, DNA copy number, DNA mutations, and protein kinome activity. Lastly, we will test these computational models on human tumors to evaluate their predictive performance. Project Narrative Breast cancer is not one disease, but instead, represents multiple diseases. Each of these unique subtypes requires a different therapeutic approach, thus, determining which new drugs will benefit each disease subtype is critical. To address this need, we are focusing on one of the most therapeutically difficult to treat breast cancer subtypes, namely Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBC). We also propose to develop a mathematical representation of a key growth regulating pathway (i.e. EGFR-MAPK) that will predict its activity in TNBC patients, and thus could be used to guide therapies to those patients who have this pathway active within their tumors. We will ultimately test our predictive model on human tumors coming from clinical trials, and if successful, we will have developed a new biomarker for guiding TNBC patient treatments through the use of objective mathematical models",Predictive Modeling of the EGFR-MAPK pathway for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients,9729382,U01CA238475,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' malignant

"Integrating novel GIS and GPS data to assess the impact of built environments on changes in BMI, physical activity and cancer-related biomarkers in two successful weight loss interventions in women at In 2018, 266,120 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected. The Breast Cancer and Environment Research Program, funded by NIEHS and NCI, identified a need to better understand environmental exposures to inform cancer prevention efforts. Further, Just in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) employ temporal and spatial cues to prompt behavior change, but little is known about spatial predictors of behaviors at the minute level and beyond home neighborhoods. Two successful weight loss trials in women at risk for breast cancer, conducted in harmony under the NCI-funded Transdisciplinary Research and Energetics in Cancer Center, offer a unique opportunity to examine the health impacts of changing environmental exposures in a heterogeneous sample. One trial focused on older breast cancer survivors, the other on women across the age range at increased breast cancer risk due to their obesity status. The studies included numerous identical measures at baseline and 6 months, including biomarkers, GPS and accelerometer measurements, and perceived environment surveys. We propose to investigate the relationship between minute level objective GIS measured walkability, greenspace, pollution and food environments and changes in BMI, physical activity (PA), and cancer related biomarkers. Few studies have assessed the impact of the built environment on weight loss interventions using objective daily measures, and none included biomarkers of cancer risk. Further, no studies have employed novel GPS measures of total environment exposure that can change as behaviors change in an intervention. Assessing the effects of built environments on intervention outcomes and investigating changes in exposure over time will provide more causal evidence to inform the policy agenda. Most data on built environment and health are cross sectional. We need longitudinal, causal evidence to support policy changes in urban design that will have lasting impact on large population groups and those at risk, recommended by the WHO, IOM and CDC. In addition, we will use estimates of exposure change from the current study to simulate the potential impact of JITAIs and to identify decision points, decision rules and tailoring variables for future interventions. The current study will geocode each GPS coordinate (42 million), integrate built environment data on walkability, greenspace, pollution and food environments in GIS using validated integrated data analysis techniques, and investigate whether the environment influences changes in biomarkers, BMI and PA. The Ecological model posits that factors at the individual, interpersonal, and community level can influence behavior and health. These analyses will assess the multi-level predictors, while adjusting for interpersonal and individual covariates. Results will be disseminated to existing community partners from cancer, aging and transportation planning to inform local advocacy efforts. This study will also inform future RCTs controlling for individual and environmental predictors at baseline and inform JITAIs by developing and testing minute level spatial, temporal and behavioral rules. Women in two weight loss interventions changed their behavior overtime. We will assess how the environment around them may have affected their behaviors to inform future studies that use spatial cues to prompt behavior change.","Integrating novel GIS and GPS data to assess the impact of built environments on changes in BMI, physical activity and cancer-related biomarkers in two successful weight loss interventions in women at",9728575,R01CA228147,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Communities ', ' Cues ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Inflammation ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Humulin R ', ' Insulin ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' mortality ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' VIT D ', ' Vitamin D ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Businesses ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Funding ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Health Food ', ' healthy food ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Pollution ', ' frailty ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' behavior change ', ' Surgeon ', ' cancer risk ', ' hospital readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' re-admission ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Population Group ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' survive cancer ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' environmental change ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' demographics ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' food environment ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' Breast Cancer survivor ', ' built environment ', ' social media ', ' personalized approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' Green space ', ' greenspace ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' cancer biomarkers ', ' cancer markers ', ' walkability ', ' walkable ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' remote location ', ' active lifestyle ', ' active living ', ' active life style ', ' intervention participants ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,519007,0.13828402300012083
"Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk Project Summary/Abstract Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women at the age of 40 and older. Mammography has been used as a low-cost screening tool for breast cancer. The recent controversy on breast cancer screening recommendations has increased public awareness and interests for informed counseling of screening and health care options based on individualized estimates of risk. The goal of this proposed project is to develop a computerized image-based biomarker to assess the breast cancer risk of individual patients in the screening population. The innovation of our approach lies in the fact that the quantitative breast parenchyma descriptor (q-BPD) will be designed to take into account not only the percentage of dense tissue (PD) but also the stromal and epithelial structural pattern of an individual's breast that is complementary to, rather than a surrogate of, the breast density. The q-BPD is obtained by a joint analysis of the complexity of the parenchymal distribution pattern (mammographic parenchymal pattern, MPP) and the amount of dense tissue (PD) as they are imaged on full-field digital mammograms (FFDMs). We hypothesize that the proposed q-BPD is an independent risk factor for breast cancer and will have a stronger predictive power than previous approaches such as PD or BI-RADS density categories alone. To test the hypothesis, we have the following specific aims: (1) to collect a matched case-control data set of 500 breast cancer cases and 2000 matched controls with 5 years of prior FFDMs (prior to cancer diagnosis for the case group). We will split the entire data set into independent subsets for training and validation; (2) to design a q-BPD by using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to maximize the discriminatory power at the personal level; (3) to investigate the association of developed q-BPD with breast cancer risk in comparison with commonly used density descriptors, such as radiologist's estimates of BI-RADS density categories and interactive PD on FFDMs by case-control studies and statistical analyses, taking into account other confounding risk factors. When fully developed, the automated q-BPD can be incorporated as a part of routine breast cancer screening. It will not only be useful for breast cancer risk prediction for individual patients but also for monitoring of risk regression or progression over time due to treatment or other factors. The new risk prediction tool is expected to play a key role in personalized breast cancer screening for women at different risk levels, thereby reducing health care costs while benefiting high risk women. The success of this project will lay the foundation for future large-scale clinical trials to address the limitations and investigate the clinical utilities of the proposed q-BPD for breast cancer risk prediction. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed quantitative descriptor of breast parenchyma (q-BPD) can serve as a cost-effective biomarker to assist in stratification of screening strategy for individuals, follow-up, risk management, and monitoring of preventive treatment of high-risk women or interventional treatment of breast cancer patients, as well as for research and development of new treatment regimens.

"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer. The functionality of the software will substantially transcend limitations of current analysis of cancer images, and will open the way for more precise and effective surgical planning as well as for more specific diagnosis of cancer based on its imaging characteristics, eventually leading to individualized medicine.",Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast

"A Noninvasive, Precision Medicine Approach to Improve Breast Cancer Screening Using Cell-free RNA from Saliva. Breast cancer screening by mammography is part of routine wellness care for women starting at around age 40 in the United States. 40 million women are screened annually with mammograms to detect the ~250,000 new cases of breast cancer that occur each year. Mammograms still miss 15% of cancers, and sensitivity falls to 45-50% in women with high density breasts, which is more common in younger women. High breast density is itself considered a risk factor for breast cancer (BC), and the FDA has declared managing breast density information a major policy goal for 2018. More women are also now identified as at high risk for breast cancer with commonly available genetic testing. Detection of breast cancer at its earliest, curable stages is precisely when imaged based screening methods are more likely fail. Imaging methods clearly play an important role in early BC detection, providing structural information about the tumor, but are not fail proof, and would benefit from complementary screening tools, especially in cases where imaging is more likely to fail (younger women, high breast density). Precision medicine approaches and liquid biopsies have the potential to transform cancer detection and management. Saliva is a noninvasive biofluid that contains functional biomarkers, including RNA, protein and metabolites. Biomarkers for many diseases have been identified in saliva, including breast cancer. As a screening method, saliva sampling is noninvasive and easy to collect, and compatible with procedures at the point-of-care, such as at breast imaging clinics. To date, saliva based diagnostic efforts have largely been undertaken in academia, without a comprehensive industry-initiated approach for product development and commercialization. In this phase 1 project, “A Noninvasive, Precision Medicine Approach to Improve Breast Cancer Screening Using Cell-free RNA from Saliva,” we propose to develop the first saliva-based companion screening diagnostic for BC. Our prototype test called CertinaTM was developed by applying our proprietary and novel algorithmic approach to gene expression microarray data from saliva collected from BC patients and has been validated in two separate clinical cohorts. Our initial 9-gene signature has an 83% sensitivity and 90% specificity for invasive BC detection. In this phase 1 project, our objectives are to develop a saliva collection kit optimized for collection of our signature RNA, with room temperature stability for collection and transport, with our partner Oasis Diagnostics, a leader in the field of saliva collection devices; establish a saliva biobank for BC assay validation, partnering with Cancer Research Collaborations in Southern California to collect a wide range of clinical samples for longitudinal studies and for use in assay improvement; assess the accuracy of our signature in early stage breast cancer and in women with dense breasts, as well as improve performance of the CertinaTM assay. Completing these objectives will provide the tools for a Phase II large-scale study, pairing our test with primary screening in breast cancer as the first saliva-based commercial diagnostic for breast cancer. Breast cancer screening by mammography is part of routine wellness care in the US for women over 40, but has detection rates as low as 50% in some groups of women, and a high false positive rate, requiring additional follow up and invasive biopsies to ensure the absence of cancer. A saliva based diagnostic test for breast cancer is proposed here, that has potential for tremendous public health impact to transform and enhance breast cancer screening. The proposed test is a noninvasive, gene expression based test from saliva, which will complement image-based structural information with biological information, improve breast cancer detection, reduce false alarms, and simplify screening workflows. .","A Noninvasive, Precision Medicine Approach to Improve Breast Cancer Screening Using Cell-free RNA from Saliva.",9778292,R43CA232952,"['Age ',

"Deep interpretation of mammographic images in breast cancer screening Project Summary/Abstract Screening mammography has been shown effective in early detection of breast cancer and in reducing mortality. However, controversies and challenges still remain, with primary concerns on personal breast cancer risk prediction from mammographic parenchymal markers, high recall and benign biopsy rates, and improving radiologists’ clinical reading practices. Computerized methods have been developed in these regards, with the goal of providing computer assistance to radiologists in making clinical decisions. While successful, the accuracy of these methods is subject to appropriate data representation (i.e., image features) that requires strong feature engineering. A newly emerged artificial intelligence technique, called deep learning, represents a breakthrough in machine learning paradigms, and has revolutionized computer image analysis and many other applications in the past few years. Breast cancer screening yields a huge amount of mammogram data that requires in-depth interpretation to improve current clinical workup. The goal of this study is to develop and optimize a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based computational approach to improve mammographic imaging trait identification, analysis, and interpretation and to use this approach to address accurate breast cancer risk prediction and reduce false recall rates. This study will be the first to examine the effects of the revolutionary deep learning technique on performing in-depth interpretation of big screening mammogram data, aimed at improving clinical practice. The new risk biomarkers will contribute to providing more accurate risk prediction than currently available. The recall-decision model will help reduce false recalls (associated with potential benign biopsy results), and better understand radiologists’ reading behaviors. Overall, the CNN-based approach will optimize the clinical utility of screening mammography and has a high likelihood to translate to the clinic for breast cancer screening. Public Health Relevance Statement (Project Narrative): We propose to apply a revolutionary deep learning approach to mine a big data of digital mammograms for improving mammogram data analysis and interpretation. This study will provide a computer-aided deep learning toolkit for improving breast cancer risk prediction and for aiding individual radiologists in their clinical decision-making on recalls. By introducing this newly emerged powerful machine learning technique to the clinical side of breast cancer screening, it will contribute to improving personal breast cancer risk prediction and reducing unnecessary recalls.

"Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy Project Abstract More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. BBD is associated with increases in BC risk, ranging from 1.5-2.0 times for least severe categories to fourfold for most severe types. However, these risks apply to groups of women, not individuals, and individual risk varies considerably within BBD categories. Further, we have shown that breast cancer (BC) risk prediction models, such as the “Gail Model”, perform poorly among women with BBD. Previously, we developed the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies, which provides individual risk estimates based on self-reported factors, detailed characteristics of BBD extent and severity, and assessment of involution (shrinkage and disappearance) of surrounding histologic structures (terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs)) from which most BC precursors arise. BBD-BC outperforms the Gail Model in predicting BC risk. However, given that radiologically-guided small (percutaneous) biopsies have largely replaced surgical biopsies for diagnosis, a new model based on this biopsy approach is needed. Further, the emergence of mammographic density as an important BC risk factor, development of novel methods to assess TDLU involution and increased use of biomarkers in routinely processed clinical samples offer an opportunity to develop an improved BC risk prediction tool for women with percutaneous biopsy diagnoses of BBD. The goal of this project is to build a BC risk prediction tool for women with BBD diagnosed on percutaneous needle biopsy that could be validated in diverse populations and implemented clinically. We propose to develop a cohort at Mayo that includes >7,000 women who were diagnosed with BBD on a percutaneous biopsy of whom >400 later developed BC. We will develop a model to predict BC that includes factors in the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies. We will also assess mammographic density, measured as a volume and area, using validated methods. We will identify immunohistochemical markers that can be applied to BBD biopsies to predict future risk of developing BC and evaluate novel NanoString RNA assays, which measure expression of related genes as composite “signatures” reflecting cancer-like characteristics, proliferation, and a mutation-like score for the important TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Finally, we will develop an epidemiologic “case-cohort” that includes a random subset of women from the full cohort (n~500) and all the women that developed invasive BC (n~250). We will evaluate BC risk prediction in this case-cohort of 750 women to evaluate performance of risk models without biomarkers and with biomarkers using novel machine learning approaches that offer strengths compared with more typical statistical models. Using these data, we will build an absolute risk prediction model for the full cohort that can be tested in other populations. Project Narrative More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. Although routine pathology diagnoses stratify groups of women with BBD into different levels of BC risk, individual risks vary greatly within these categories. Leveraging discoveries in prior work that resulted in a predictive model for BBD diagnosed on surgical biopsies, we will build a new model for percutaneous biopsies (now the dominant sampling method), which incorporates mammographic density, novel tissue biomarkers and machine learning statistical approaches.",Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy,9739251,R01CA229811,"['active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' mammographic breast density ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' senescence ', ' senescent ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' nano-string ', ' nanostring ', ' screening ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' immunohistochemical markers ', ' immunohistochemical biomarkers ', ' random forest ', ' risk prediction model ', ' classification trees ', ' regression trees ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' Needle biopsy procedure ', ' needle biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Breast Diseases ', ' mammary disorder ', ' Breast Disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Cox Models ', ' Cytokeratin 8 ', ' Diagnosis ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' ROC Curve ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' p53 Genes ', ' Tumor Protein p53 Gene ', ' TRP53 ', ' TP53 ', ' P53 ', ' TP53 gene ', ' oncosuppressor gene ', ' Tumor Suppressing Genes ', ' Recessive Oncogenes ', ' Oncogenes-Tumor Suppressors ', ' Onco-Suppressor Genes ', ' Emerogenes ', ' Cancer Suppressor Genes ', ' Antioncogenes ', ' Anti-Oncogenes ', ' Tumor Suppressor Genes ', ' Measures ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologic ', ' Histologically ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Surgical Models ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Terminal Ductal Lobular Unit ', ' TDLU ', ' Breast Cancer Model ', ' mammary tumor model ', ' mammary cancer model ', ' Breast tumor model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Gail model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2019,619727,0.1504502724838877
"3D Super-Resolution Ultrasound Imaging for Cancer Detection and Treatment Monitoring PROJECT SUMMARY Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the standard of care for treatment of locally advanced breast cancer, which is a major clinical issue. Access to inexpensive and noninvasive methods to determine early treatment response are essential to determine if a chosen anticancer therapeutic regimen is efficacious. Tumor angiogenesis is a key biomarker of breast cancer growth and metastasis. This tumor microvascularity is known to exhibit distinct perfusion characteristics and morphologic features during the early stages of breast tumor development which fundamentally change during a positive response to neoadjuvant treatment. The overarching goal of this research project is to develop an innovative three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution (SR-US) imaging system and new image processing solutions to considerably improve our ability to perform in vivo quantitative analysis of tumor angiogenic networks. The first aim of this project involves optimization of 3D SR-US imaging functionality on a programmable US scanner equipped with a custom 1024-element (32 x 32) matrix array transducer. The second aim involves the development of new open-source SR-US image processing software for performing motion correction and quantitative analysis of tumor perfusion and microvascular morphology features in 3D space. In the third aim, we will evaluate the use of angiogenic biomarkers extracted from 3D SR- US images as a quantitative basis for distinguishing healthy from diseased tissue volumes in a transgenic animal model of breast cancer. We will also assess the use of in vivo 3D SR-US imaging for detection of early tumor response to neoadjuvant treatment using the same animal model.

"Towards Clinically Effective AI for Screening Mammography Abstract Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and a leading cause of cancer mortality. Early detection of breast cancer can reduce mortality and morbidity, which has led to widespread mammography screening, recommended for women ages 50-74 on a yearly or bi-yearly basis. Reading the mammogram images to decide if cancer may be present is difficult due to the rarity of occurrence – in a screening population, 99.5% of women do not have cancer – and the visual challenge of finding what can be a very subtle abnormality on a complex background. This difficulty, combined with the high volume of mammograms – 39 million per year in the US – has led to a variety of proffered solutions including software known as computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Despite early promise, such solutions have not fulfilled their potential in improving outcomes and are largely thought to increase interpretation times. Productivity is increasingly a concern due to the rapidly growing use of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT or “3D” mammography), which has demonstrated higher cancer detection rates than traditional 2D mammography, but also takes much longer to interpret. As a potential solution, there has been significant interest in applying deep learning to mammography. Deep learning (DL) is a powerful field of machine learning which learns image features in an end-to-end fashion from data, and has been used to achieve human level performance on a number of imaging pattern recognition tasks. This proposal seeks to create DL-based software for mammography that can be effective in a clinical setting through (1) accurate and robust predictions on a diverse population of patients, (2) interpretable results from the DL model (no “black box” answers), and (3) applicability to both 2D mammography and DBT. In Phase I, the aim is to improve model performance by training on additional data and incorporating additional algorithmic advances. Phase I will conclude with a clinical reader study comparing performance of the software to radiologists. In Phase II, the aim is to improve the clinical effectiveness of the software by automating quality detection, incorporating prior exams into the model, and expanding the training dataset to ensure results generalize to any woman eligible for screening mammography. These improvements will apply to both 2D and DBT. Achieving the desired performance levels will enable a product that will improve productivity for radiologists and ensure consistent and accurate interpretations for patients. Success in this project would be a large step towards translating state-of- the-art artificial intelligence to clinically effective tools for screening mammography. Project Narrative Though mammography screening is widely considered beneficial for women ages 50-74, the varied challenges with reading the images lead to missed cancers or over-diagnosis, which in turn result in shorter length of life or unnecessary invasive procedures for many women. The goal of this project is use recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to create a tool for doctors that will help them interpret mammograms more accurately and efficiently. These improvements will enable better outcomes for women by improving access to quality mammography interpretations, especially in resource-constrained areas.",Towards Clinically Effective AI for Screening Mammography,9847578,R44CA240022,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Award ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' computer-assisted diagnostics ', ' Computer aided diagnosis ', ' Computer-Assisted Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Illinois ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Intelligence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Oregon ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Productivity ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Measures ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Ensure ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Visual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' radiologist ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Improve Access ', ' Reader ', ' American College of Radiology ', ' Callback ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' commercialization ', ' patient population ', ' screening ', ' Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ', ' Mammographic screening ', ' mammography screening ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' improved outcome ', ' clinical development ', ' deep learning ', ' screening guidelines ', ' screening recommendations ', ' recommended screening ', ' ']",NCI,"DEEPHEALTH, INC.",R44,2019,236313,0.15094148533405813
"Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose that collagen features, such as alignment, fiber straightness and width, and other features of extracellular matrix composition can be used as an early biomarker of breast cancer. It is the goal of this proposal to determine the range of collagen structural features that characterize normal, benign and early disease, to determine how these features relate to mammographic density, and to identify the features that best predict risk, recurrence, and progression. This proposal leverages a diverse collaborative team that includes experts in imaging and understanding the tumor microenvironment, breast surgery, experts in population health and biostatistics, and an expert in proteomic analysis of the ECM. This team will analyze a set of patient cohorts to develop imaging and analysis of collagen structure and ECM composition as a potential early biomarker for breast cancer. Aims: 1) Characterize collagen features that define heterogeneity of the normal state. 2) Characterize collagen features in pre- and early breast cancer lesions. 3) Characterize the proteomics of biopsies representing benign, at risk, and invasive breast cancer. Significance: This project meets the goals of the RFA to develop and validate combined imaging and biomarker approaches to improve early cancer detection and the diagnosis of early-stage cancers. Our findings have the potential to reduce overdiagnosis and false positives and discern lethal from non-lethal disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The widespread adoption of screening mammography throughout the 1980s and 1990s led to a reduction in breast cancer mortality as more women were diagnosed at an earlier stage of disease and could be more successfully treated. Apart from their use in visualizing the tumor, mammograms are quantifiable based on the density of the signal in the image, which is based on the absorbance of x-rays by cells and the filamentous protein collagen. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and in the breast is present as a scaffolding network that supports the milk-secreting epithelial cells of this gland. In non-diseased breasts, the mammographic density is a function of the amount of collagen present, and is highly correlated to a 4-6 fold increased risk of developing breast cancer in the future. Mammographic density has been deemed so important that over a dozen states have recently passed legislation requiring physicians to inform patients of this value. However, the problem is that mammographic density does not predict survival once a tumor has been detected. Thus, although we have improved our detection of breast cancers, we do not have the ability to sort patients into groups where disease progresses from those that do not. Our current paradigm of treating everyone aggressively needs to change to a targeted plan of treating only those women at risk of future life-threatening disease. It is our hypothesis that it is not the overall macroscpic amount of collagen present, but rather the structure and organization of collagen at the local level which predicts cancer progression. We will examine tissue samples from a variety of non-diseased human patient cohorts, with the goal of discovering a biomarker for disease progression based on collagen structure. This will be done non-invasively by imaging slides that are already routinely prepared using a technique called second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy which selectively images collagen. We have advanced software which will measure the length, width, straightness, density and orientation of fibers that we can use to analyze tens of thousands of collagen fibers from dozens of images per sample. This high level of quantitation improves our statistical ability to discover the underlying biomarker from the noise. By understanding the normal non-diseased state, we can apply this knowledge to very early cancer stages in order to sort patients into aggressive and non-aggressive therapy groups. As a compliment to these studies, we will also determine the protein composition of the collagen matrix, as there are dozens of other proteins present. Preliminary data has shown changes in the makeup of proteins found in normal tissue compared to breast cancer, implying that the change in collagen structure is related to the underlying expression of proteins there. Through our proposed experiments, we will establish what a truly ""normal"" collagen matrix looks like in terms of structure and composition.",Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for

"Reducing recall rates of screening mammography with deep convolutional neural network PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the recent successes of screening mammography, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in women and the leading cause of death in women aged 45 to 55. This suggests that there is an urgent need to improve the current approaches to breast cancer screening based on mammography. The specificity of the screening mammography is also limited as the continued large fraction of false-positives often leads to unnecessary follow-up procedures including biopsy that cause considerable pain, anxiety and cost. It is therefore necessary to improve diagnostic accuracy of mammography in terms of both sensitivity for early detection of breast cancer and specificity to keep the recall rate 10% or less as recommended by American College of Radiology. In this study, we investigate deep convolutional networks (DCN) for medical imaging by developing from scratch a novel family of DCNs based on the characteristics of medical images and evaluating it on screening mammographic exams. We design a novel, multi-view DCN that will work with a set of multiple views in their original resolution so as to avoid missing crucial micro-structures, opposed to using heavily downscaled images as often done with natural images or by some earlier work on applying DCN to medical images. Unlike most existing works which verify their approaches on a small number of cases, we propose to train and test the proposed networks on a large-scale data consisting of about 500,000 cases collected over the period of five years at our institution. Our preliminary experiments using an initial version of the multi-view deep convolutional network with about 25,000 cases strongly support the need for the proposed large-scale, high- resolution deep learning for early-stage breast cancer screening. We have also collected 201,000 cases of screening mammograms to date and are in the process of annotating the cases based on the available follow- up studies. The overarching goal of this study is to develop, optimize and test a multi-view DCN system that can either independently read a series of screening mammographic exams to identify early breast cancers accurately or to assist a human reader so as to reduce reading time and improve confidence in early breast cancer detection. Aim 1 is to develop and optimize a multi-view DCN for automatic breast screening. Aim 2 is to conduct preliminary reader study on the impact of the MV-DCN as a screening exam aid system. The outcome of this study, the multi-view DCN for automatic breast screening and the preliminary assessment of its impact on human readers, will form an important basis on which further investigation into optimizing deep convolution networks for medical imaging can be conducted.

"Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K24 proposal combines mentoring in patient oriented cancer control research; research to translate evidence-based shared decision-support for screening mammography to the clinic; and career development in Implementation Science. The PI, Dr. Elizabeth Burnside, has been an influential mentor throughout her career at the University of Wisconsin (UW), fostered by leadership positions like her role as the co-lead of the Cancer Control Program in the UW NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Her mentoring and research both promote team science, which unites medical and ""translational"" disciplines like informatics, engineering, and population health, all areas for which she has expertise and departmental affiliate appointments. This award would carve out the necessary time for her to build a platform on which to formalize her mentoring approach and a curriculum to support a cadre of physician/scientists developing decision support tools aimed for clinical translation. This proposal takes advantage of a successful Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) funded at UW in 2006, committed to mentoring, patient oriented team science, and translational research. The aims included in this proposal are closely aligned with the UW CTSA -KL2 and other institutional training grants and fully leverage the rich mentoring and career development resources.  The patient oriented scientific aims proposed arise from healthcare shortfalls that she, a radiologist practicing in breast imaging, sees every day in clinic. They buid on her NCI funded R01 which asks the question: How can decision support in the clinic help healthcare providers optimize breast cancer screening and diagnosis in aging women? Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women = 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized strategies are needed to decrease morbidity and mortality, while minimizing harms (false positives and overdiagnosis-the detection of cancer that would not go on to cause symptoms or death). Though validated decision aids currently exist, immense opportunities still remain: personalization, integration in the clinical workflow, and implementation with high fidelity; all goals of this proposal. Personalized decision support tools will only be useful if they are thoughtfully designed and rigorously implemented.  Both her scientific aims and her career development plans integrate the new discipline of Implemenation Science. These methodologies will enable her to translate advances into an EMR-embedded decision tool for improved breast cancer screening decision-making for women = 65 and their physicians. Innovation is substantial; creating a tool that incorporates national simulation models to accurately convey outcomes that is integrated into the EMR has not been done. This award will enable Dr. Burnside to become an influential mentor of clinician-scientists using implementation science to advance personalized decision support into the clinic. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to build a mentorship program for clinicians who are developing tools that use a patient's unique characteristics to help make optimal health care decisions. The proposed research exemplifies this important goal by using the newest scientific techniques to develop and test a personalized decision tool to help women age 65 or over decide (with their physician) whether to undergo breast cancer screening. By combining mentoring, research, and new scientific methodologies, this plan will powerfully translate the science of personalized prediction to patients to help make decisions that are right for them.",Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis,9717098,K24CA194251,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Award ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Influentials ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychologist ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Decision Aid ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' radiologist ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' tool ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' novel ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' cancer care ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Resource Development ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network ', ' CISNET ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' implementation science ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' surveillance network ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' Mammographic screening ', ' mammography screening ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' support tools ', ' personalized strategies ', ' individualized strategies ', ' personalized decision ', ' personalized data-driven decision ', ' personalized clinical decision ', ' individualized decision ', ' individualized clinical decision ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' clinical translation ', ' personalized risk prediction ', ' Individualized risk prediction ', ' personalized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' screening guidelines ', ' screening recommendations ', ' recommended screening ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K24,2019,173648,0.27588535688574367
"Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression Approximately 20% of breast cancers detected through mammography are pre-invasive Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS). If left untreated, approximately 20-50% of DCIS will progress to more deadly Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). No prognostic biomarkers can reliably predict the risk of progression from DCIS to IDC. Similar genomic profiles of matched pre-invasive DCIS and IDC suggests that the progression is not driven by genetic aberrations in DCIS cells, but microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia and metabolic stress prevalent in DCIS, may drive the transition. We need innovative models to investigate how to halt steps of DCIS progression to invasive phenotypes and subsequent metastasis from the primary site. This proposal directly addresses this unmet need by developing a novel three-dimensional in vitro organoid model that recapitulates key hallmarks of DCIS to IDC progression: tumor-size induced hypoxia and metabolic stress, tumor heterogeneity and spontaneous emergence of migratory phenotype in the same parent cells without any additional stimulus. A tangible advantage of the proposed organoid models is the ability to precisely and reproducibly study how the hypoxic microenvironment induces tumor migration in real time and in isolation from non-tumor cells present in vivo, providing unique opportunity to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of DCIS to IDC progression. Our preliminary observations lead to central hypothesis that tumor size-induced hypoxia establishes a “hypoxic secretome”, which initiates the migratory phenotype; the hypoxic secretome then cooperate with intracellular signaling networks to independently maintain cell migration. We propose three independent but inter-related aims to link hypoxic secretome with the initiation, maintenance and spatial distribution of migratory phenotypes. Aim 1 will engineer size-controlled DCIS organoids (150-600 µm) with controlled hypoxic microenvironments to identify and examine how hypoxic secretome initiates migratory phenotype. We will combine experimental organoid models with time-lapse imaging and computational approaches to study organoid migration. Aim 2 will demonstrate that migratory cells can re-establish the secretome and maintain migratory phenotype independent of hypoxia. We will reconstruct an intracellular signaling network activated by the hypoxic secretome using microarray data. We will verify these gene expression signatures in sorted migratory and non-migratory cells, and validate them using secretome inhibition studies. Aim 3 will investigate, for the first time, the spatial distribution and origin of the migratory phenotype. We will use CRISPR-based gene knock-in (FP-labeling), automated image analyses, and a deep-learning algorithm to track and visualize the emergence of migratory phenotypes from the hypoxic core outward to the periphery or from the migratory front. The successful development of this 3D organoid model and completion of the proposed work will provide answers to two fundamental questions in the progression of invasive breast cancer: 1) What causes some DCIS cells to become migratory and develop into invasive tumors? 2) How and where does the migratory phenotype (IDC) emerge? The mechanistic understanding gained from these studies will improve diagnosis, lead to the development of treatment strategies to arrest invasion at the pre-malignant stage, and thus prevent patient overtreatment. It is straightforward to generalize our system to other tumor types, development of tumor/stromal co-culture, and drug screening. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of death in women. Lack of mechanistic understanding on how a breast cancer in situ develops into malignant invasive breast cancer contributes to growing problem of both overtreatment and undertreatment. To address this, we propose to develop three-dimensional organoid model using cell lines and primary patient-derived cells. Based on existing studies and our own preliminary studies, we hypothesize that organoid size-induced hypoxia and secretome factors work cooperatively to initiate and maintain the migratory phenotype.

"Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis PROJECT SUMMARY  The advent of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) or “3D mammography” brings promise of improved sensitivity and specificity. Even as DBT undergoes rapid clinical adoption, this new imaging modality poses new challenges to radiologists due to many differences in image appearance compared to conventional mammography. Recent studies and clinical experience show the urgent need for improved training in DBT. These changes necessitate dedicated training for both radiology residents and board-certified radiologists. The currently accepted training paradigm (i.e., the “one size fits all” approach) cannot effectively accommodate the individual needs of each radiologist-in-training. We propose to address this shortcoming.  This project seeks to develop a new paradigm of adaptive, computer-enhanced training in the interpretation of DBT. Using predictive algorithms similar to the recommendation systems of companies like Amazon and Netflix, our system will create a training environment tailored to the needs of each individual radiologist. We have shown that the radiologists-in-training do not make errors in a random manner; instead their error making demonstrates specific patterns. Even more importantly, those errors can be predicted from each individual’s previous interpretations. We propose to use machine learning-based user modeling as well as collaborative filtering algorithms to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each individual. Then, we will adapt the training protocol to the individual needs of the trainee in order to accelerate the training and improve his/her diagnostic skills in the areas that need improvement. The aims are: (1) develop user models that predict the difficulty of a DBT case based its image features and trainee performance, (2) implement an educational system that presents training cases that focus on the unique needs of each individual, and (3) conduct a reader study to validate the improved effectiveness of the proposed adaptive system.  This has work has the following key innovations. We propose the first ever computer-aided education system for residents and radiologists that is adaptive and individualized. We leverage cutting edge concepts from the fields of user modeling and collaborative filtering, which our lab has introduced to the field of medical imaging. This work addresses training limitations for the newly adopted modality of DBT.  This research has very high clinical significance: Improving training in the interpretation of breast images will ensure the greatest benefit of breast cancer screening. The proposed work, while developing a fully functional DBT education system, will contribute to the foundation for a more general, new paradigm of improved individualized education that extends to other image interpretation tasks and imaging modalities. This work is a collaboration between computer vision and machine learning experts, breast imaging radiologists, director of Radiology residency, a biostatistician, and a human factors expert. Our technology will be disseminated through a partnership with IMAIOS, a leading provider of online radiology education. Digital breast tomosynthesis is becoming a standard practice in breast cancer screening and there is a pressing need for effective education in this new modality. In this study we propose to develop a computer system for education in digital breast tomosynthesis that adapts itself to each trainee and to find an individualized training protocol that fits best the trainee’s needs. Such system could improve dramatically the time efficiency of training in digital breast tomosynthesis images and improve diagnostic performance of the trainees. This is likely to improve the overall effectiveness of breast cancer screening and, given high importance of breast cancer screening, decrease mortality rate of the disease.",Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis,9724474,R01EB021360,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Breast ', ' computing system ', ' Computer Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Computers ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' continuing medical education ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Hand ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Residencies ', ' Rest ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' radiologist ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' Appearance ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Reader ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' case-based ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' clinical practice ', ' Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' ']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,469394,0.2766951105647728
"Development and Clinical Implementation of an Artificial Intelligence Tool to Predict Risk of Upgrade of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This proposal presents a five-year career development plan focused on data science and artificial intelligence (AI) and the application of AI to improve outcomes in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The candidate is a Radiologist at MGH and an Assistant Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School. The proposal builds upon the candidate’s previous research and clinical experiences in breast imaging and also upon a strong ongoing research partnership between MGH and MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). The candidate’s long-term career goal is to become a leader in academic breast imaging by investigating and applying AI to critical areas in breast cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment. The proposed research project and advanced didactic training at Harvard and MIT will position the candidate with a unique set of knowledge and skills in data science and AI that will enable her to develop an independent cancer research program that focuses on applications of AI to breast imaging.  The incidence of DCIS has dramatically increased over the past 40 years, with an estimated 63,960 diagnoses in 2018. Current guidelines recommend that DCIS be treated with surgery, radiation, and endocrine therapy, but there remains considerable controversy over whether this regimen represents overtreatment for those women with indolent non-hazardous DCIS. Given concerns about overtreatment, there are currently three randomized controlled trials underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of active surveillance versus standard treatment, and critical to the implementation of active surveillance programs is careful selection of eligible patients. The goal of the proposed project is to develop a robust AI tool that incorporates clinical data, mammographic imaging, and biopsy histopathology slides for pre-operatively predicting the risk of concurrent invasive cancer in women with DCIS. The tool will be built using machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. Incorporation of mammographic imaging and histopathology slides into the AI tool will be supported by the MGH & BWH Center for Clinical Data Science (CCDS) and the MGH Department of Pathology. After development and validation of the AI tool based on a retrospective cohort of 1,400 women diagnosed with DCIS at MGH, the tool will then be integrated into MGH’s mammography information system and used to categorize new cases of DCIS. The specific aims are: (1) to develop a robust AI tool that predicts the risk of upgrade of DCIS diagnosed by image-guided core needle biopsy to invasive cancer at surgery and (2) to implement and evaluate the AI tool in clinical practice. Use of this tool could identify the subset of women who are appropriate candidates for active surveillance, decrease the morbidity and costs of overtreatment, and support more targeted and precise treatment options for women diagnosed with DCIS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Every year, more than 60,000 women are diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which is also known as noninvasive or Stage 0 breast cancer, and undergo an aggressive treatment regimen involving surgery, radiation, and hormonal therapy. We propose to develop and implement a robust tool, using artificial intelligence, to pre-operatively predict the risk that DCIS will upgrade to invasive cancer at surgery. Development of a highly reliable prognostic tool could identify the subset of women who may not need aggressive treatment, decrease the morbidity and costs associated with overtreatment, and support more targeted and precise treatment options for women diagnosed with DCIS.",Development and Clinical Implementation of an Artificial Intelligence Tool to Predict Risk of Upgrade of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ,9806162,K08CA241365,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' DCIS ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Hormone Receptor ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Laboratories ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Medical Records ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Radiology ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' radio-therapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Indolent ', ' Development Plans ', ' radiologist ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Slide ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' professor ', ' computer science ', ' Histopathology ', ' Adjuvant Therapy ', ' skills ', ' Duct (organ) structure ', ' Duct ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Institution ', ' Core Needle Biopsy ', ' Core Biopsy ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' Breast screening ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Data ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Clinical Data ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Malignant Epithelial Cell ', ' Carcinoma Cell ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' mammographic breast density ', ' cost ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' cancer invasiveness ', ' prospective ', ' tumor ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' Regimen ', ' breast imaging ', ' mammary imaging ', ' image guided ', ' image guidance ', ' prognostic tool ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Data Science ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' predictive tools ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' Risk stratification ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' clinical implementation ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' deep learning ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' random forest ', ' surgical risk ', ' surgery risk ', ' ']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2019,259979,0.12955745943521893
"A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis The long-term goal of this project is to develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis, thus aiding in improving the quality of both cancer research and clinical practice. Since diagnostic errors can cause altered treatment recommendations and significant patient harm, tools that semi-automate the diagnostic process to improve efficiency, reliability and accuracy are thus needed by both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. Our work will produce a set of machine-learning tools to identify regions of interest (ROI), classify these regions into the full spectrum of diagnostic categories (ranging from benign, to pre-invasive/risk lesions, to invasive cancer), and culminate in the development of a unified software package for cancer diagnosis that can be shared among cancer researchers and clinicians. Our aims are: Aim 1: Regions of Interest. Produce 1a) a ROI finder classifier and associated tools for use by researchers or pathologists for automatic identification of potential ROIs on whole slide images of breast biopsy slides and 1b) a ROI analysis classifier and associated tools that can point out image regions that tend to cause misdiagnosis and produce suitable warnings as to why such regions may either be distractors or indicate cancer. Aim 2: Diagnosis. Produce a diagnostic classifier and associated tools that can not only suggest the potential diagnosis of a whole slide image, but can also produce the reasons for the diagnosis in terms of regions on the image, their color, their texture, and their structure. Aim 3: Dissemination. Develop a unified software package containing this suite of tools, so they can be easily shared and provided (standalone and through the existing PIIP platform) to both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. In addition to specific classifiers for breast cancer research, we will provide the methodology to train related classifiers for other biopsy- diagnosed cancers, such as melanoma, prostate, lung, and colon cancer. Our highly innovative diagnostic tools will include our state-of-the-art (2017) feature extraction and machine learning methods as opposed to the generic image management tools of the current ITCR projects. Our classifiers were trained on a unique data set acquired in a carefully designed breast cancer research study, so they are immediately useful in the breast cancer domain, but designed to be easily retrained for other data sets and cancers. The addition of our unique multi-disciplinary team and these tools to the ITCR program will be an important aid to cancer research and will improve the process of diagnosis for clinicians. Quality medical care requires an accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic errors lead to lower quality research and can lead to reduced quality of care and inappropriate treatment decisions that result in harm to patients. Our team will develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis and will share these tools with cancer researchers and pathologists on a publicly available platform.",A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis,9781678,U01CA231782,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Carcinoma ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Epithelial cancer ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' DCIS ', ' Color ', ' web-based training ', ' web-based instruction ', ' virtual learning ', ' virtual education ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' online learning ', ' online education ', ' on-line learning ', ' on-line education ', ' multimedia learning ', ' internet-based training ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' electronic learning ', ' eLearning ', ' digital learning ', ' digital education ', ' computer-based training ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' E-learning ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' Diagnosis ', ' diagnosis errors ', ' Diagnostic Errors ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Glass ', ' Goals ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Marketing ', ' Mammectomy ', ' Mastectomy ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Pathology ', ' Surgical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Second Opinions ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Malignant ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' programs ', ' Slide ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' digital imaging ', ' computer imaging ', ' experience ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' research study ', ' Categories ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Atypia ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' digital ', ' imaging informatics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cancer invasiveness ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical practice ', ' screening ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Breast biopsy ', ' imaging system ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' whole slide imaging ', ' digital pathology ', ' pathology imaging ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U01,2019,443782,0.1804259094792704
"INTEGRATING OMICS AND QUANTITATIVE IMAGING DATA IN CO-CLINICAL TRIALS TO PREDICT TREATMENT RESPONSE IN TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER Project Summary Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a very challenging disease because it is biologically aggressive, there are no targeted therapies, and, consequently, patients have poor prognosis. Although immunotherapy is promising for treating many cancers, TNBC lacks specific molecular targets, no predictive biomarkers to chemotherapy response have yet been identified, and treatment response is difficult to evaluate using current biomarker assessments. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of TNBC offer the exciting opportunity of evaluating this disease in terms of molecular features (e.g., genomic copy number, whole exome sequence, and mRNA expression) to identify candidate “omic” biomarkers that best predict the ultimate response to treatment and could provide surrogate endpoints to validate novel imaging biomarkers in co-clinical trial human trails. Moreover, emerging quantitative MRI methods, such as dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI), contain rich physiological signals in the images for predicting treatment response, but it is challenging to integrate both animal and human data to reliably predict the treatment response. A paradigm of “co-clinical trials” is emerging in which new treatments are evaluated in animals, and the results guide treatments in clinical trials, but there is a paucity of informatics tools and resources to enable analyses in such animal-to-human work. We believe that an informatics-based methodology that integrates molecular `omics' and imaging data will propel advances in TNBC by enabling development of machine learning models to predict the response to therapies. In order to develop research resources that will encourage consensus on how quantitative imaging methods are optimized to improve the quality of imaging results for co-clinical trials, we will leverage an ongoing co-clinical trial we are undertaking to pursue the following specific aims: (1) Identify molecular biomarkers that predict response in TNBC patient-derived xenografts (PDX); (2) Identify quantitative MRI biomarkers that predict response in TNBC patient-derived xenografts; and (3) Evaluate our informatics tools in a prospective co-clinical trial. Our proposed research is significant and innovative because it leverages advances in basic cancer biology, state-of-the-art imaging technologies, and informatics methods to develop a resource to catalyze discovery in this important disease. Our PDX-based approach will provide the cancer community with a rational, iterative, combined pre-clinical and clinical methodology and supporting data resource for making progressively more refined and personalized therapeutic regimens for TNBC patients. Our methods and tools will likely also generalize to other cancers and could, therefore, substantially benefit the care of all cancer patients. Project Narrative Determining the optimal therapies for a specific triple negative breast cancer tumor is currently not possible, as the number of possible treatment combinations is too large to evaluate experimentally in clinical trials. Our proposed methods that leverage patient derived xenografts and machine learning analysis of integrated `omics and quantitative imaging data will provide the cancer community with a rational, iterative, combined pre-clinical and clinical trial approach and supporting data resource for making progressively more refined and personalized therapeutic regimens in these patients.

"Combination FGFR4 and ER-Targeted Therapy for Invasive Lobular Carcinoma Project Summary Even though invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) accounts for 10-15% of the breast cancer seen in the US, there remains much to be learned about the unique nature of this disease. For example, patients with ILC are likely to have tumors with expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ER), a biomarker of good prognosis. Yet, patients with ER+ ILC have worse long-term outcomes compared to patients with the more commonly studied subtype of ER+ invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). The standard treatment regimen for ER+ disease includes endocrine therapy, so the big picture focus of this grant asks: why do some ILC patients have a worse outcome than expected on endocrine therapy, and for those patients, what additional treatments can we provide? This grant aims to assess the effect of FGFR4 expression on cell survival and signaling in vitro, identify biomarkers for FGFR4 activation in silico, and test the efficacy of FGFR4 inhibition on clinical samples ex vivo. Methods include 1) FGFR4 inhibition with shRNAs and small-molecule inhibitors, 2) RNA-Sequencing, 3) machine-learning, and 4) explant models of ILC patient tumors. The ultimate goal of the proposed aims is to provide rationale for specific combination targeted therapy in patients with lobular breast cancer, in accordance with the mission statement of the NCI. Project Narrative The goal of this research is to identify why endocrine therapy has lasting benefits for only a subset of women with breast cancer. The proposed studies include RNA-Sequencing to understand how molecular changes impact survival outcomes. Results of this and future research will complement findings from ongoing clinical trials to identify the best combination of targeted therapy for each individual with breast cancer.",Combination FGFR4 and ER-Targeted Therapy for Invasive Lobular Carcinoma,9609432,F30CA203154,"['differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' targeted agent ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' small molecule inhibitor ', ' survival outcome ', ' three dimensional cell culture ', ' 3D culture ', ' 3D cell culture ', ' clinical development ', ' translational cancer research ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' cell growth ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' Fibroblast Growth Regulatory Factor ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor Gene Family ', ' FGF ', ' Endothelial Cell Growth Factor ', ' DNA Synthesis Factor ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' In Vitro ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Tamoxifen ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Woman ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Family ', ' FGFR ', ' FGF-R ', ' FGF Receptors ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors ', ' Mediating ', ' Clinical ', ' Lobular ', ' Lobular Carcinoma ', ' Lobular Breast Carcinoma ', ' Lobular Adenocarcinoma ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Dependence ', ' Endocrine ', ' experience ', ' Estrogen Receptor alpha ', ' Estrogen Receptor α ', ' Estradiol Receptor α ', ' Estradiol Receptor alpha ', ' ERα ', ' ERalpha ', ' novel ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' gene expression assay ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Proteomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' kinase inhibitor ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' FGFR4 gene ', ' TKF Gene ', ' JTK2 Gene ', ' FGFR4 ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' infiltrating duct carcinoma ', ' invasive ductal carcinoma ', ' invasive ductal adenocarcinoma ', ' infiltrating ductal carcinoma ', ' infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma ', ' Malignant Epithelial Cell ', ' Carcinoma Cell ', ' Molecular ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' Outcome ', ' migration ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' small hairpin RNA ', ' short hairpin RNA ', ' shRNA ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' tumor ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' efficacy testing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F30,2019,50016,0.25628101202967923
"3-D modeling-based decision support for optimizing quality of life following breast reconstruction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast reconstruction is a central component of the breast cancer treatment process for many women. The purpose of breast reconstruction is to recreate a breast form that is satisfying to the patient, facilitating her psychosocial adjustment o living as a breast cancer survivor. Decisions about breast reconstruction can be difficult and overwhelming for many women due to the number of options available and conflicting values and preferences. The long-term goal of our research is to enhance the consultation process for women undergoing breast reconstruction surgery. Our vision is a decision support system that will enable breast cancer patients, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to choose a reconstruction strategy with maximal potential to optimize psychosocial adjustment. This system for shared decision-making will use quantitative models to tailor the presentation of patient-specific information about breast reconstruction outcomes. Three common features of decision support systems are the knowledge base; the methodology for combining that knowledge with patient-specific information; and the communication mechanisms. With recent NIH support, we established a unique knowledge base through a longitudinal study of 500 women who underwent breast reconstruction. We also developed preliminary computational models for combining that knowledge base with patient-specific data. Our models are parameterized by experimental, clinical, and psychosocial data and employ techniques from 3D image analysis, biomechanical modeling and simulation, machine learning, and decision analysis. In the proposed project, we will develop predictive algorithms for combining the knowledge base and patient- specific information, and we will develop communication mechanisms both for gathering necessary patient- specific information and for delivering information about the decision basis to the patient and her multidisciplinary care team. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our vision is a decision support system that will enable breast cancer patients, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to choose a reconstruction strategy that will lead to maximal psychosocial adjustment.

"Assessment of Repeatability and Robustness of Radiomics in Breast Cancer Imaging Summary The overall aim of this project is to investigate and better understand the repeatability and robustness of radiomics in breast cancer imaging. Radiomics from medical images can provide information about lesion features such as size, irregularity, and texture, which can be used to produce quantitative image-based phenotypes that can assist in diagnosis of cancer and assessment of treatment. Using previously acquired radiomics measurements of breast cancer imaged by full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and magnetic resonance (MR), Aim 1 of this study is to assess their repeatability using three classifiers (linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and Bayesian neural network methods), bootstrapping for variability assessment, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) methods. By doing so, we will be able to evaluate how radiomics may be expected to vary in their output and performance on FFDM and MR. In Aim 2, we endeavor to understand the cross-modality performance of radiomics measurements of lesion cases imaged by both FFDM and MR. This work will provide a new understanding of the robustness of radiomics tumor descriptors compared across two modalities and fulfill a currently unmet need – thus being both novel and significant. Statistical analysis will be conducted using superiority and non-inferiority testing. These studies will provide a better understanding of the repeatability and robustness of radiomics of breast lesion images, an important step in establishing their utility in disease diagnosis and treatment assessment. Project Narrative Breast cancer is a significant public health concern; it is estimated that one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. Radiomics makes use of quantitative image-based phenotypes, also called features, to provide information about the presence of cancer and its response to treatment, which can aid physicians in medical decision making. The overall objective of this study, addresses a currently unmet need and aims to assess the repeatability of radiomics made from mammography and magnetic resonance images of breast cancer and to determine the robustness of radiomics for lesions imaged across two modalities, mammography and magnetic resonance; the aims of this study are designed to contribute to better understanding of the utility and generalizability of the role of radiomics in cancer patient management and precision medicine.",Assessment of Repeatability and Robustness of Radiomics in Breast Cancer Imaging,9654299,R15CA227948,"['Bibliography ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Computers ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discriminant Analyses ', ' Discriminant Analysis ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' mammographic exams ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' breast ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Mammography ', ' Ultrasonic Mammography ', ' Breast Ultrasonography ', ' Mammary Ultrasonography ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Lesion ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Collaborations ', ' Descriptor ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' interest ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' breast lesion ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Magnetic Resonance ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Prognosis ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Characteristics ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cancer imaging ', ' tumor imaging ', ' oncology imaging ', ' oncologic imaging ', ' tumor ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' quantitative imaging ', ' radiomics ', ' Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Breast MRI ', ' Bayesian neural network ', ' ']",NCI,WHEATON COLLEGE,R15,2019,396673,0.3194563235915923
"Targeting invadopodia-related mechanisms of cancer cell invasion and metastasis Metastasis causes >90% of breast cancer-related deaths. Tumor cell structures that have been hypothesized as necessary for metastasis are invadopodia, protrusions rich in structural proteins (e.g. Tks5), adhesion proteins (e.g. integrin β1) and proteases (e.g. MT1-MMP), known to degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.  A novel, real-time imaging methodology that allows investigation of the in vivo metastatic role of invadopodia found that cells which assemble invadopodia move at “Slow” speeds and are seen in perivascular niches. Outside of perivascular niches, “Fast” motile cells, which do not assemble invadopodia were observed. This method also showed that invadopodia are essential for intravasation in vivo.  Preliminary work has begun to determine which aspects of the Slow phenotype allow invadopodia assembly. Use of novel mathematical models, in vitro microscopy and novel computational image analysis demonstrates that whereas the Fast cells continuously locomote, the Slow cells are in either of two oscillating states: i. Invadopodia state, in which a cell is sessile while it degrades surrounding ECM; ii. Locomotion state, similar to a Fast cell. The oscillation dynamics appear to depend on interactions between the ECM and its receptor integrin β1. Importantly, the Invadopodia, but not Locomotion state, is limited to G1 phase of the cell cycle. Release from G1-arrest amplifies invadopodia, implying that G1-arresting therapies may promote metastasis. This project will identify the mechanisms unique to the Invadopodia state compared to cells that only proliferate or locomote, with the idea of targeting the Invadopodia state.  Overall Hypothesis: the Invadopodia state, which is essential for metastasis, requires a pause in both cell locomotion and cell cycle progression. The initiation and termination of the Invadopodia state are controlled by the interaction between the ECM, invadopodia components integrin β1 and Tks5, as well as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 (expressed during G1). Aim 1. Determine the role of the cell cycle in regulating the Invadopodia state. Using real-time imaging of cell cycle and invadopodia markers in vitro and in vivo, this Aim tests the hypothesis that cyclin- dependent kinases and corresponding inhibitors regulate the Invadopodia state, but not the Locomotion. Aim 2. Determine the role of ECM-cancer cell interactions in regulating the oscillations between Invadopodia and Locomotion states. This Aim will provide a strategy based on in vivo modification of integrin β1 activity on how to turn Invadopodia state ”off” towards metastatic prevention. Significance. Invadopodia is suggested as a new candidate target for metastatic prevention. The use of cell cycle inhibitors in patients with invadopodia may be accelerating metastatic dissemination. The long- term goal is to predict and prevent metastasis using invadopodia. This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of invadopodia regulation by the cell cycle and oscillations between Invadopodia and Locomotion states.

"Predicting Long-Term Chemotherapy-Related Cognitive Impairment ABSTRACT Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) affects an estimated 60% of patients, negatively impacting quality of life. Currently, there is no established method for predicting which patients will develop CRCI. This information could be practice-changing by assisting clinicians with treatment decision-making for individual patients. We have shown that the brain network (“connectome”) is significantly altered in patients with CRCI. Therefore, we measured the connectome is patients prior to any treatment and demonstrated that these connectome properties could be used in combination with machine learning to predict 1 year post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment with 100% accuracy. The proposed project aims to test this preliminary prediction model in a new, larger sample with the overarching goal of validating its use for clinical practice. We will enroll 100 newly diagnosed patients with primary breast cancer scheduled for adjuvant chemotherapy who will be assessed prior to any treatment, including surgery with general anesthesia, 1 month after chemotherapy treatment and again 1 year later. We will also enroll matched healthy female controls who will be assessed at yoked intervals. We will combine these data with retrospective data we obtained during a prior study for a total sample of 150 in each group. Data from healthy controls will be used to determine impairment status in patients with breast cancer and to provide a template of typical connectome organization for comparison. We hypothesize that our machine learning model will accurately predict 1 year post- chemotherapy cognitive impairment and that it will be more accurate than a model that includes patient- related and medical variables alone. We will also examine longitudinal changes in connectome organization associated with impairment subtypes (i.e. persistent vs. late onset impairment) as well as changes in specific functional networks (e.g. default mode, salience, executive-attention and sensory- motor networks). This information will provide novel insights regarding the neural mechanisms of CRCI and may also help us refine our prediction models. RELEVANCE A significant proportion of women who receive chemotherapy for breast cancer will experience long- term problems with brain function, such as thinking, memory and attention that reduce quality of life and extend disease-related disability. The proposed study aims to validate a model for predicting who will develop long-term cognitive impairment and to examine the underlying causes of this impairment.

Early detection of breast cancer can reduce mortality and morbidity, which has led to widespread mammography screening, recommended for women ages 50-74 on a yearly or bi-yearly basis. Reading the mammogram images to decide if cancer may be present is difficult due to the rarity of occurrence – in a screening population, 99.5% of women do not have cancer – and the visual challenge of finding what can be a very subtle abnormality on a complex background. This difficulty, combined with the high volume of mammograms – 39 million per year in the US – has led to a variety of proffered solutions including software known as computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Despite early promise, such solutions have not fulfilled their potential in improving outcomes and are largely thought to increase interpretation times. Productivity is increasingly a concern due to the rapidly growing use of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT or “3D” mammography), which has demonstrated higher cancer detection rates than traditional 2D mammography, but also takes much longer to interpret. As a potential solution, there has been significant interest in applying deep learning to mammography. Deep learning (DL) is a powerful field of machine learning which learns image features in an end-to-end fashion from data, and has been used to achieve human level performance on a number of imaging pattern recognition tasks. This proposal seeks to create DL-based software for mammography that can be effective in a clinical setting through (1) accurate and robust predictions on a diverse population of patients, (2) interpretable results from the DL model (no “black box” answers), and (3) applicability to both 2D mammography and DBT. In Phase I, the aim is to improve model performance by training on additional data and incorporating additional algorithmic advances. Phase I will conclude with a clinical reader study comparing performance of the software to radiologists. In Phase II, the aim is to improve the clinical effectiveness of the software by automating quality detection, incorporating prior exams into the model, and expanding the training dataset to ensure results generalize to any woman eligible for screening mammography. These improvements will apply to both 2D and DBT. Achieving the desired performance levels will enable a product that will improve productivity for radiologists and ensure consistent and accurate interpretations for patients. Success in this project would be a large step towards translating state-of- the-art artificial intelligence to clinically effective tools for screening mammography. Project Narrative Though mammography screening is widely considered beneficial for women ages 50-74, the varied challenges with reading the images lead to missed cancers or over-diagnosis, which in turn result in shorter length of life or unnecessary invasive procedures for many women. The goal of this project is use recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to create a tool for doctors that will help them interpret mammograms more accurately and efficiently. These improvements will enable better outcomes for women by improving access to quality mammography interpretations, especially in resource-constrained areas.",Towards Clinically Effective AI for Screening Mammography,10124519,R44CA240022,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Computer-Assisted Diagnosis ', ' Computer aided diagnosis ', ' computer-assisted diagnostics ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Illinois ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Intelligence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Oregon ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Productivity ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Measures ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Ensure ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Visual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Funding ', ' radiologist ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Improve Access ', ' Reader ', ' American College of Radiology ', ' Callback ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Validation ', ' Preparation ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' commercialization ', ' patient population ', ' screening ', ' Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ', ' mammography screening ', ' Mammographic screening ', ' mammary imaging ', ' breast imaging ', ' improved outcome ', ' clinical development ', ' deep learning ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' screening guidelines ', ' ']",NCI,"DEEPHEALTH, INC.",R44,2020,858992,0.15094148533405813
"QUANTITATIVE IMAGING BIOMARKERS OF TREATMENT RESPONSE AND PROGNOSIS IN BREAST CANCER ABSTRACT Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Around 20% to 30% of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer will have a recurrence and may eventually die of their disease. Currently, there are no reliable methods to identify which cancers will recur on an individual basis. Because of this, adjuvant therapies are given to nearly all patients with breast cancer, but benefit only a small proportion. A similar dilemma exists for neoadjuvant treatment, many patients fail to pathologically response to chemotherapy, and yet suffer from the associated toxicity. The conventional one-size-fits-all approach causes overtreatment, leading to morbidities and mortalities. To avoid these side effects, biomarkers that stratify patients with clinical relevance are critically needed for precision medicine in breast cancer. Molecular profiling is currently used to stratify breast cancer, but is limited by the requirement for invasive biopsy and confounded by intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity. Conversely, imaging provides a unique opportunity for the noninvasive interrogation of the tumor, its microenvironment, and invasion to surrounding normal tissues. We hypothesize that imaging characteristics reflect underlying tumor biology, and quantitative imaging features can provide independent valuable information, which are synergistic to known clinical, histologic, and genetic predictors. Accordingly, we have planned three specific aims to develop new quantitative imaging biomarkers for breast cancer, as well as clinically and biologically validate them. In Aim 1 we plan to develop automated computational tools to robustly quantify whole tumor, intratumor subregions, and parenchyma phenotypes from multimodal MRI. The curated breast cancer cohort (n=504) from our preliminary study will be analyzed, with available MRI scans and manually-delineated contours of tumor and parenchyma by board-certified radiologists. In Aim 2 we will build imaging feature-based models to predict recurrence-free survival and treatment response separately. By integrating with clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, the comprehensive models can predict clinical outcomes more accurately. The internal cohort (n=450) will be used for discovery, and the multi-center prospective cohort from I-SPY (n=186) will be used for validation. In Aim 3 we will elucidate the biological underpinnings behind our newly identified prognostic and predictive imaging biomarkers, by correlating them with biospecimen-derived phenotypes from the same tumor. In particular, we will investigate multi-omics molecular data as well as tumor morphology from H&E stained pathology slides. Three cohorts will be analyzed, including our internal cohort (n=450), the I-SPY cohort (n=186), and the TCGA cohort (n=1095). For three proposed aims, we have carried preliminary studies to prove the feasibility. By leveraging the richness of available well-annotated data and advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, it will increase the likelihood of success. Our proposed research will point new biomarkers of high value to better predict recurrence and treatment response at the individual level, and lead to better treatment decisions for women with breast cancer. Narrative This project aims to augment the imaging role in the personalized management of breast cancer, by developing automated tools to extract quantitative imaging biomarkers from both tumor and parenchyma, as well as evaluating the biological and clinical relevance of these imaging biomarkers. The new imaging biomarkers will work synergistically with the existing clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, to better stratify breast cancer patients and guide individualized therapy. Together, these will promote a major paradigm shift of MR imaging role and allow it serve as an important approach in personalized cancer management.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGING BIOMARKERS OF TREATMENT RESPONSE AND PROGNOSIS IN BREAST CANCER,10168918,R00CA218667,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Eosine Yellowish ', ' Eosin ', ' Tetrabromofluorescein ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histology ', ' Kinetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"A comprehensive liquid biopsy platform for detection and prognostication in early stage breast cancer Project Summary We seek to develop robust platforms for capturing, enumerating and analyzing circulating tumor cells and associated cancer cells from the blood of cancer patients. We will leverage our previously developed precisely engineered microfilter platform that allows effective separation and collection of viable CTC from patient blood. In parallel, we have developed novel imaging methods perfectly suited for rapid analyses for circulating tumor cells, clusters and associated cancer cell subtypes (such as Cancer Associated Fibroblasts, or CAF). We propose to integrate these two novel technologies to create a robust diagnostic tool for clinical pathology as well as basic research that enables capture, enumeration, and analyses of circulating tumor cells and associated cancer cells. Our multidisciplinary team proposes the following Specific Aims: 1) Build and validate the technology to rapidly acquire CTC/CAF images using Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy and evaluate the images with a deep learning algorithm  2) Evaluation of the integrated platform for using CTC/CAF in predicting recurrence/survival in early stage  breast cancer patients For these studies in early stage breast cancer, we have robust collaborations with industry partners in Circulogix Inc (Microfilter technology for cell capture), ClearBridge Inc. (FPM imaging of the microfilter surface), and Google Software (Deep learning algorithm for analyzing FPM images of microfilter). The ability to reliably and rapidly detect and analyze CTC and associated cancer cells in early stage breast cancer patients would deliver a major new tool for oncology research, a platform for screening of novel drugs, and a critical advance in precision cancer management. Project Narrative (Relevance) Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) and circulating Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (cCAF) are the agents of spread of cancer (metastasis), which is a direct cause of a large number of cancer-related deaths. Our interdisciplinary team of pathologists, engineers, cancer cell biologists, and microscopists along with industry partners will combine their novel technologies to, for the first time, establish robust capture, rapid identification and enumeration of CTC, cCAF and their clusters from whole blood of early stage breast cancer patients.

"Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy Project Abstract More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. BBD is associated with increases in BC risk, ranging from 1.5-2.0 times for least severe categories to fourfold for most severe types. However, these risks apply to groups of women, not individuals, and individual risk varies considerably within BBD categories. Further, we have shown that breast cancer (BC) risk prediction models, such as the “Gail Model”, perform poorly among women with BBD. Previously, we developed the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies, which provides individual risk estimates based on self-reported factors, detailed characteristics of BBD extent and severity, and assessment of involution (shrinkage and disappearance) of surrounding histologic structures (terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs)) from which most BC precursors arise. BBD-BC outperforms the Gail Model in predicting BC risk. However, given that radiologically-guided small (percutaneous) biopsies have largely replaced surgical biopsies for diagnosis, a new model based on this biopsy approach is needed. Further, the emergence of mammographic density as an important BC risk factor, development of novel methods to assess TDLU involution and increased use of biomarkers in routinely processed clinical samples offer an opportunity to develop an improved BC risk prediction tool for women with percutaneous biopsy diagnoses of BBD. The goal of this project is to build a BC risk prediction tool for women with BBD diagnosed on percutaneous needle biopsy that could be validated in diverse populations and implemented clinically. We propose to develop a cohort at Mayo that includes >7,000 women who were diagnosed with BBD on a percutaneous biopsy of whom >400 later developed BC. We will develop a model to predict BC that includes factors in the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies. We will also assess mammographic density, measured as a volume and area, using validated methods. We will identify immunohistochemical markers that can be applied to BBD biopsies to predict future risk of developing BC and evaluate novel NanoString RNA assays, which measure expression of related genes as composite “signatures” reflecting cancer-like characteristics, proliferation, and a mutation-like score for the important TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Finally, we will develop an epidemiologic “case-cohort” that includes a random subset of women from the full cohort (n~500) and all the women that developed invasive BC (n~250). We will evaluate BC risk prediction in this case-cohort of 750 women to evaluate performance of risk models without biomarkers and with biomarkers using novel machine learning approaches that offer strengths compared with more typical statistical models. Using these data, we will build an absolute risk prediction model for the full cohort that can be tested in other populations. Project Narrative More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. Although routine pathology diagnoses stratify groups of women with BBD into different levels of BC risk, individual risks vary greatly within these categories. Leveraging discoveries in prior work that resulted in a predictive model for BBD diagnosed on surgical biopsies, we will build a new model for percutaneous biopsies (now the dominant sampling method), which incorporates mammographic density, novel tissue biomarkers and machine learning statistical approaches.",Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy,9987569,R01CA229811,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biopsy ', ' Needle biopsy procedure ', ' needle biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Diseases ', ' Breast Disorder ', ' mammary disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cox Models ', ' Cytokeratin 8 ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' RNA ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' TP53 gene ', ' P53 ', ' TP53 ', ' TRP53 ', ' Tumor Protein p53 Gene ', ' p53 Genes ', ' Tumor Suppressor Genes ', ' Anti-Oncogenes ', ' Antioncogenes ', ' Cancer Suppressor Genes ', ' Emerogenes ', ' Onco-Suppressor Genes ', ' Oncogenes-Tumor Suppressors ', ' Recessive Oncogenes ', ' Tumor Suppressing Genes ', ' oncosuppressor gene ', ' Measures ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Individual ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' ER Positive ', ' ER+ ', ' Estrogen receptor positive ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Surgical Models ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' TDLU ', ' Terminal Ductal Lobular Unit ', ' Breast tumor model ', ' mammary cancer model ', ' mammary tumor model ', ' Breast Cancer Model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model ', ' Breast Cancer Gail Model Risk Assessment Tool ', ' Gail model ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' mammographic breast density ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' Expression Signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' gene expression signature ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' senescent ', ' senescence ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' molecular marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' nanostring ', ' nano-string ', ' screening ', ' tissue biomarkers ', ' immunohistochemical biomarkers ', ' immunohistochemical markers ', ' random forest ', ' risk prediction model ', ' classification trees ', ' regression trees ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2020,721306,0.1504502724838877
"Long noncoding RNA regulations in breast cancer among African-American women ABSTRACT Breast cancer rates among African-American (AA) women continue to rise and may further widen breast cancer disparities experienced by AA women, who are more likely to develop aggressive tumor types with a worse prognosis. The biological reasons for these differences remain largely unknown. Recent genome-wide, high-throughput studies highlight an emerging role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as a novel class of regulatory molecules in cancer. LncRNAs form an important regulatory layer in global gene expression, and increasing evidence indicates that abnormal expression of specific lncRNAs can contribute to breast cancer carcinogenesis and progression. Studies to date, however, are focused exclusively on EA women, have not commonly used high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) to provide unbiased comprehensive profiling, and mostly do not incorporate rigorous normal tissue controls. Motivated by these research gaps and limitations, we recently completed a pilot study of genome-wide lncRNA expression profiling in normal and tumor breast tissues from AA and EA women. LncRNA expression data showed clear tissue- and subtype- specific expression patterns. Importantly, we noted a number of differentially abundant lncRNAs between AA and EA women by estrogen receptor (ER) status. These results indicate that there are unique lncRNA expression patterns in AA tumors, which we hypothesize contributes to aggressive tumor biology and high breast cancer-related mortality. We propose a cost-effective study in a well-characterized cohort of AA breast cancer patients in the Women’s Circle of Health Study (WCHS), which has available tumor tissue blocks, and extensive data on tumor characteristics, clinical outcomes, treatments received, lifestyle factors, and genome- wide DNA methylation. As such, our Specific Aims are: 1) Perform tissue lncRNA expression profiling using total RNA sequencing (1181 AA cases from WCHS and 100 AA controls from Komen Tissue Bank) to determine lncRNAs that are breast cancer- and ER subtype- specific (tumor, ER+, ER- vs. normal) and those associated with clinico-pathological factors (e.g., grade); 2) Examine associations of lncRNA expression levels with breast cancer survival, and use a machine learning approach to identify a combined panel of lncRNAs associated with breast cancer survival; and further perform computational prediction and in vitro functional assays to determine their biological relevance; and 3) Integrate paired data on lncRNA expression and DNA methylation to determine which of these cancer- and prognosis-relevant lncRNAs are regulated by DNA methylation, and explore whether diet, obesity and other lifestyle-related factors are associated with aberrant DNA methylation. This work is novel and findings are anticipated to advance our understanding of molecular mechanisms contributing to aggressive tumor biology and poor cancer prognosis observed in AA women that can be translated into the development of targeted strategies for prevention and therapeutics. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) African American (AA) women have a higher risk of being diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer and have the highest mortality rate among all racial groups in U.S. women.

"Integrative subtyping to improve therapeutic options for metastatic hormone receptor-positive breast cancer Project Summary/Abstract This is an application for a K08 Award to Dr Jennifer Caswell-Jin, an Instructor and breast oncologist at Stanford University establishing a career in translational breast cancer genomic research. The Award will support her career development by providing training in clinical trials, biomarker development, and bioinformatic analysis of multi-omic data under the expert mentorship of Dr Christina Curtis, computational and cancer systems biologist, and Dr George Sledge, breast cancer clinical trialist and translational researcher. The proposed research focuses on the major public health problem of metastatic breast cancer, estimated to affect over 150,000 women and to cause over 40,000 deaths each year in the United States. Hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer is the most common subtype. Eight “integrative” subtypes of HR+ breast cancer have been identified based on the integration of genome-wide copy number and expression information in early-stage breast tumors. Four integrative subtypes, together comprising one-quarter of all HR+ early-stage breast cancers, exhibit a very high risk of distant metastasis; each of these subtypes is characterized by a distinct area of the genome that exhibits concomitant copy number gain and overexpression. The studies in this proposal will examine for the first time how integrative subtypes behave after metastasis, with the driving hypothesis that they may derive benefit from personalized therapeutic approaches. Aim 1 is to investigate the biology and impact of integrative subtypes in metastatic HR+ breast cancer. We will develop novel approaches to assess integrative subtypes and will learn whether they change across metastasis, whether they are associated with timing of metastasis, and whether they have differential lengths of response to standard therapies. Aim 2 is to evaluate the effects of a novel combination of targeted therapy in two integrative subtypes of metastatic breast cancer. We will perform a clinical trial that tests a targeted therapeutic approach in tumors classifying as one of two of the four high-risk integrative subtypes. Because these two subtypes are defined by focal areas of genomic alteration involving either the fibroblast growth factor receptor ligand (FGF3; integrative subtype 2) or the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1; integrative subtype 6), we hypothesize that these tumors may benefit from FGFR inhibition. Participants in this trial will receive standard endocrine therapy in combination with CDK4/6 inhibition, as well as an investigational agent that inhibits the fibroblast growth factor receptor pathway. We will also perform tumor biopsies before and during treatment to evaluate for changes that occur with this combination targeted therapy approach. Successful completion of the proposed studies will lay the groundwork for continued efforts to develop a precision oncology approach for metastatic HR+ breast cancer, with next steps to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K08 Award. Project Narrative Metastatic breast cancer, of which hormone receptor-positive breast cancer is the most common, is estimated to affect approximately 150,000 women in the United States; most of these women will die of breast cancer, making it the second leading cause of cancer death among women. This proposal will examine distinct molecular categories of hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer to understand whether different treatments may affect these groups differently. The knowledge gained will lay the groundwork for a personalized approach to therapy for metastatic breast cancer to improve health and lengthen life.",Integrative subtyping to improve therapeutic

"The Role of Tumor-Infiltrating Immune Cells and Estrogen Receptor Expression in Racial Disparities in Breast Cancer Biology. ABSTRACT: African-American (AA) women are more likely to have aggressive tumors and poorer survival than European-American (EA) women. Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying this disparity is a critical unmet need with major public health implications. The tumor immune milieu may play a pivotal role in breast cancer disparities, specifically tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that have roles in oncogenesis and disease progression. Using H&E stained slides from a large epidemiological case-control study, we have discovered that AA women have significantly higher levels of TILs than EA women – especially in the estrogen receptor (ER) negative subgroups. This indicates a distinct biological difference in the tumor immune response related to race and ER status, and also presents a conundrum in which TILs that are often associated with better outcome are higher in AA women, who typically fare worse with breast cancer. These findings indicate that the specific composition of immune cell populations and their spatial arrangement within the tumor environment are likely to be important mitigating factors for the role of TILs in breast cancer progression, and tumor differences between AA and EA women. Our preliminary data from the NanoString PanCancer Immune Panel support this idea by revealing that AA women have gene expression signatures indicative of higher levels of exhausted T cells than EA women, which have a diminished capacity to destroy tumor cells, consistent with the poorer survival observed in AA women. Here, immune gene expression profiles also varied by ER status, pointing to a potential immunoregulatory role of ER in breast cancer.  To date, most studies that examine TILs do so in cohorts of predominantly EA women and in-depth immune profiling studies in large cohorts of AA women are lacking. To address this shortcoming, we will employ multispectral staining and imaging with the Vectra® Quantitative Pathology System to delineate immune cell populations and ER expression in 996 breast cancer samples from the Women's Circle of Health Study. Building on our preliminary data, we propose to evaluate two immunofluorescence panels, each with multiple biomarkers in their spatio-morphological context. While both panels will include ER and a differentiating cytokeratin marker, panel 1 will include four common T cell markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3), and panel 2 will include markers of T cell exhaustion (TIGIT, LAG3, PD-1) that may play a key role in the differential immune response between AA and EA women. Our proposal involves the full implementation of a new generation of biomarker assessment techniques – multiplexed staining, multispectral imaging, automated scoring, and digital spatial analyses. A thorough comparison of the immune landscape in breast tumors in regards to race and ER expression will inform our understanding of immune escape mechanisms, and how these processes differ by ancestry. This will be critical for designing immunotherapy strategies that will equally benefit AA women, serving to reduce racial disparities in breast cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE African-American women are more likely to have aggressive tumors and poorer survival than European- American women and this may be due to biological differences in their tumor immune cells. We will use a sophisticated tumor tissue staining and imaging approach to evaluate the immune cells in breast cancer samples from a large group of predominantly African-American women. Our findings will inform on the abundance and types of immune cells present in breast tumors and may improve cancer immunotherapy strategies for African-American women.",The Role of Tumor-Infiltrating

"Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression Approximately 20% of breast cancers detected through mammography are pre-invasive Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS). If left untreated, approximately 20-50% of DCIS will progress to more deadly Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). No prognostic biomarkers can reliably predict the risk of progression from DCIS to IDC. Similar genomic profiles of matched pre-invasive DCIS and IDC suggests that the progression is not driven by genetic aberrations in DCIS cells, but microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia and metabolic stress prevalent in DCIS, may drive the transition. We need innovative models to investigate how to halt steps of DCIS progression to invasive phenotypes and subsequent metastasis from the primary site. This proposal directly addresses this unmet need by developing a novel three-dimensional in vitro organoid model that recapitulates key hallmarks of DCIS to IDC progression: tumor-size induced hypoxia and metabolic stress, tumor heterogeneity and spontaneous emergence of migratory phenotype in the same parent cells without any additional stimulus. A tangible advantage of the proposed organoid models is the ability to precisely and reproducibly study how the hypoxic microenvironment induces tumor migration in real time and in isolation from non-tumor cells present in vivo, providing unique opportunity to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of DCIS to IDC progression. Our preliminary observations lead to central hypothesis that tumor size-induced hypoxia establishes a “hypoxic secretome”, which initiates the migratory phenotype; the hypoxic secretome then cooperate with intracellular signaling networks to independently maintain cell migration. We propose three independent but inter-related aims to link hypoxic secretome with the initiation, maintenance and spatial distribution of migratory phenotypes. Aim 1 will engineer size-controlled DCIS organoids (150-600 µm) with controlled hypoxic microenvironments to identify and examine how hypoxic secretome initiates migratory phenotype. We will combine experimental organoid models with time-lapse imaging and computational approaches to study organoid migration. Aim 2 will demonstrate that migratory cells can re-establish the secretome and maintain migratory phenotype independent of hypoxia. We will reconstruct an intracellular signaling network activated by the hypoxic secretome using microarray data. We will verify these gene expression signatures in sorted migratory and non-migratory cells, and validate them using secretome inhibition studies. Aim 3 will investigate, for the first time, the spatial distribution and origin of the migratory phenotype. We will use CRISPR-based gene knock-in (FP-labeling), automated image analyses, and a deep-learning algorithm to track and visualize the emergence of migratory phenotypes from the hypoxic core outward to the periphery or from the migratory front. The successful development of this 3D organoid model and completion of the proposed work will provide answers to two fundamental questions in the progression of invasive breast cancer: 1) What causes some DCIS cells to become migratory and develop into invasive tumors? 2) How and where does the migratory phenotype (IDC) emerge? The mechanistic understanding gained from these studies will improve diagnosis, lead to the development of treatment strategies to arrest invasion at the pre-malignant stage, and thus prevent patient overtreatment. It is straightforward to generalize our system to other tumor types, development of tumor/stromal co-culture, and drug screening. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of death in women. Lack of mechanistic understanding on how a breast cancer in situ develops into malignant invasive breast cancer contributes to growing problem of both overtreatment and undertreatment. To address this, we propose to develop three-dimensional organoid model using cell lines and primary patient-derived cells. Based on existing studies and our own preliminary studies, we hypothesize that organoid size-induced hypoxia and secretome factors work cooperatively to initiate and maintain the migratory phenotype.

"Convergent AI for Precise Breast Cancer Risk Assessment ABSTRACT  Breast cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of cancer death among women in the United States, despite the advances made in the identification of prognostic and predictive markers for breast cancer treatment. Mammographic reporting is the first step in the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. Abnormal mammographic findings such as a mass, abnormal calcifications, architectural distortion, and asymmetric density can lead to a cancer diagnosis. The American College of Radiology developed the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon to standardize mammographic reporting to facilitate biopsy decision-making. However, application of the BI-RADS lexicon has resulted in substantial inter-observer variability, including inappropriate term usage and missing data. This observer variability has lead in part to a considerable variation in the rate of biopsy across the US, with a majority of breast biopsies ultimately found to be benign lesions. Hence, there is the need for a system that can better stratify the risk of cancer and define a more optimum threshold for biopsy. To address this need, we propose to develop an intelligent-augmented risk assessment system for breast cancer management based on multimodality image and clinical information with deep learning and data mining techniques.  This study aims to develop a well-defined, novel risk assessment system incorporating multi-modality datasets with a novel predictive model that outputs a probability measure of cancer that is more clinically relevant and informative than the six discrete BI-RADS scores. Using mammographic or breast ultrasound BI- RADS reporting signatures and radiomics features, a predictive model that is more precise and clinically relevant may be developed to target well-characterized and defined specific biopsy patient subgroups rather than a broad heterogeneous biopsy group. Our proposed technique entails a novel strategy using Natural Language Processing to extract pertinent clinical risk factors related to breast cancer from vast amounts of patient charts automatically and integrate them with corresponding image-omics data and radiologist- generated reports. We will extract and quantitate image features from both large amounts of mammography and breast ultrasound images and combine them with the radiology reports and pertinent clinical risk profile and other patient characteristics to generate a risk assessment score to aid radiologists and oncologists in breast cancer risk assessment and biopsy decisions. Such a web-based application tool will be the first breast cancer risk assessment system based on integrative radiomics data augmented by AI methods. The iBRISK tool will enhance engagement between the patient and clinician for making an informed decision on whether or not to biopsy.  Our hypothesis is that BI-RADS reports and the imaging metrics contain significant features for the breast cancer risk assessment and biopsy decision-making. By using BI-RADS reports and the imaging metrics, we will be able to develop new metrics to better breast cancer risk assessment. The novelty of the breast cancer risk assessment system is that it will incorporate a new predictive model that deploys deep learning and AI technology to provide a more reliable stratification of the BI-RADS subtypes for breast cancer risk assessment and reduce unnecessary breast biopsies and patients’ anxiety. Project Narrative  We propose to develop an intelligent-augmented risk assessment system for breast cancer management based on multimodality image and clinical information with deep learning and data mining techniques.

"The linkage between Race, Kaiso and the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer health disparities Women of African heritage suffer a higher breast cancer mortality compared to their European counterparts. Though the biologic basis for these disparities remains poorly defined, recent studies suggest definitive roles for biological variation in the gene expression pathways governing tumor behavior and alterations in the tumor microenvironment. The transcription factor Kaiso (ZBTB33) is a gene regulatory factor, found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of breast cancer cells, that has been functionally linked to racial differences in survival outcome in several epithelial cancers. In this study we leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to define functional linkages between Kaiso, autophagy and the immmune tumor microenvironment that contribute to racial differences in breast cancer survival. We accomplish this through application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to characterize the Kaiso dependent differences in spatial and topological features of the tumor microenvironment using multiplex immunofluorescent technologies to profile a unique breast cancer health disparities cohort (Specific Aim One). We then apply this technology to examine the impact of Kaiso disruption on autophagy and the immune tumor microenvironment using a murine orthotopic allograft model for Kaiso depletion in the presence and absence of pharmacologic blockade of autophagy (Specific Aim Two). We then perform a large-scale application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to profile the spatial and topological features of the tumor microenvironment in 901 racially diverse breast cancer specimens by multiplex immunohistochemistry to define the detailed role of Kaiso, autophagy and the tumor microenvironment in population-specific differences in breast cancer outcome (Specific Aim Three). Together with a closely integrated multi-disciplinary team of breast cancer pathologists, cancer biologists, computer scientists, biostatisticians, bioinformaticians and data scientists, we will define new prognostic and predictive biomarkers that link Kaiso to tumor progression, the immune tumor microenvironment, breast cancer outcome and how their association differs by race. Elevated expression of the multifunctional transcriptional regulator, Kaiso (ZBTB33) is associated with worse breast cancer survival based on race. In this study we leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to study a novel breast cancer health disparities cohort to define new functional linkages between Kaiso, autophagy and the tumor microenvironment that contribute to racially disparate breast cancer outcome.","The linkage between Race, Kaiso and the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer health

"INTEGRATING OMICS AND QUANTITATIVE IMAGING DATA IN CO-CLINICAL TRIALS TO PREDICT TREATMENT RESPONSE IN TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER Project Summary Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a very challenging disease because it is biologically aggressive, there are no targeted therapies, and, consequently, patients have poor prognosis. Although immunotherapy is promising for treating many cancers, TNBC lacks specific molecular targets, no predictive biomarkers to chemotherapy response have yet been identified, and treatment response is difficult to evaluate using current biomarker assessments. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of TNBC offer the exciting opportunity of evaluating this disease in terms of molecular features (e.g., genomic copy number, whole exome sequence, and mRNA expression) to identify candidate “omic” biomarkers that best predict the ultimate response to treatment and could provide surrogate endpoints to validate novel imaging biomarkers in co-clinical trial human trails. Moreover, emerging quantitative MRI methods, such as dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI), contain rich physiological signals in the images for predicting treatment response, but it is challenging to integrate both animal and human data to reliably predict the treatment response. A paradigm of “co-clinical trials” is emerging in which new treatments are evaluated in animals, and the results guide treatments in clinical trials, but there is a paucity of informatics tools and resources to enable analyses in such animal-to-human work. We believe that an informatics-based methodology that integrates molecular `omics' and imaging data will propel advances in TNBC by enabling development of machine learning models to predict the response to therapies. In order to develop research resources that will encourage consensus on how quantitative imaging methods are optimized to improve the quality of imaging results for co-clinical trials, we will leverage an ongoing co-clinical trial we are undertaking to pursue the following specific aims: (1) Identify molecular biomarkers that predict response in TNBC patient-derived xenografts (PDX); (2) Identify quantitative MRI biomarkers that predict response in TNBC patient-derived xenografts; and (3) Evaluate our informatics tools in a prospective co-clinical trial. Our proposed research is significant and innovative because it leverages advances in basic cancer biology, state-of-the-art imaging technologies, and informatics methods to develop a resource to catalyze discovery in this important disease. Our PDX-based approach will provide the cancer community with a rational, iterative, combined pre-clinical and clinical methodology and supporting data resource for making progressively more refined and personalized therapeutic regimens for TNBC patients. Our methods and tools will likely also generalize to other cancers and could, therefore, substantially benefit the care of all cancer patients. Project Narrative Determining the optimal therapies for a specific triple negative breast cancer tumor is currently not possible, as the number of possible treatment combinations is too large to evaluate experimentally in clinical trials. Our proposed methods that leverage patient derived xenografts and machine learning analysis of integrated `omics and quantitative imaging data will provide the cancer community with a rational, iterative, combined pre-clinical and clinical trial approach and supporting data resource for making progressively more refined and personalized therapeutic regimens in these patients.

"Point-of-care cellular and molecular pathology of breast tumors on a cell phone ABSTRACT Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women and is the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide, with 1.6 million new cases and 500,000 BC deaths annually. Patients diagnosed in low- resource settings (LRS) account for half of new cases, and the majority of deaths from BC worldwide. The first critical step to starting life-saving treatment for BC is the accurate and timely pathologic confirmation of a cancer diagnosis, a task which remains challenging in many LRS. Traditional pathology assessment involves processing surgically excised specimens with cell-block methods for: (1) cellular histopathology, which identifies abnormal cellular morphologies indicative of malignancy, and (2) molecular pathology, which identifies tumor biomarkers, specifically estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), and the proliferation maker Ki67. Breast cancer subtyping using these markers is essential for determining prognosis, as well as for selecting subtype-specific therapies. Unfortunately, histology-based pathology services require a strong pathology infrastructure and trained pathologists, limiting access to these services in many LRS. For example, there are only 15 trained pathologists in Tanzania, a country of over 55 million people. There is hence an urgent need for new methods to accurately diagnose cancer, as well as to analyze expression levels of molecular biomarkers for tumor subtyping. A technology driven solution that could automate cellular pathology with minimal user-intervention and virtually no infrastructure requirements could thus enormously impact the management of breast cancer in LRS. Motivated by this need, the objective of this proposal is to finalize the development of the EpiView-D4 point-of-care test (POCT) to analyze both the cellular and molecular features of breast cancer from needle aspiration specimens. The EpiView component of the device enables easily accessible, low-cost, smart-phone based brightfield cellular imaging of fine needle aspirate breast biopsies without the need for pathologist assessment. In parallel, the D4 POCT component of the device images a point-of-care antibody microarray for the quantification of ER/PR/Her2/Ki67 levels from breast FNA lysate with picomolar sensitivity within 30 minutes at point-of-care, eliminating the need for additional visits before a treatment plan can be initiated. The EpiView-D4 will enable automated readout of both cytopathology and the molecular profiles of breast cancer, using machine learning algorithms integrated into a smartphone application. In this proposal, we will conduct final device development and training of ML algorithms, followed by pre-clinical validation and clinical investigation of the Epiview-D4 POCT, first at Duke University Medical Center, and then in the intended LRS of Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center. The impact of this technology lies in its potential to dramatically improve breast cancer management worldwide by enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis and subtyping of breast cancers, thereby driving timely and appropriate treatment for breast cancer patients and hence improving the outcomes for hundreds of thousands of women with BC annually in LRS. PROJECT NARRATIVE In less developed parts of the world, there is an urgent need for accurate and more informative diagnosis of breast cancer as trained pathologists are scarce‚ and pathology infrastructure is often very limited. The proposed research will complete the currently ongoing development of a cell-phone based device that: (1) images cells from breast tumors and analyzes them by software to identify whether a person has breast cancer, and (2) measures levels of clinically-relevant protein biomarkers to help guide treatment. If successful, this technology can be widely by health care workers to provide the same level of care in low-resource settings as is currently available in the US and will thereby save many lives.",Point-of-care cellular and molecular pathology of breast tumors on a cell phone,9946801,R01CA248491,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Africa ', ' Antibodies ', '

"Artificial Intelligence driven prediction of brain metastasis from primary tumor sites at diagnosis Abstract: Metastasis from the primary tumor site to the brain is the most lethal complication of cancer progression and is experienced by approximately 20% of breast cancer patients worldwide. There is at present no translational approach to detect if a primary tumor has brain metastatic potential, no markers that predict successful future metastasis, and thus no therapies to target any of the processes involved. These gaps are difficult to bridge due to a lack of technology that can classify a cancer cell’s brain metastatic potential. Current in vivo murine models are slow to manifest metastasis and do not have the capability of capturing single cell morphology and dynamics; therefore, we propose a diagnostic platform to measure the phenotypic differences between cancer cells and to assign them a brain metastatic potential. The output is a quantitative diagnostic read out that defines the probability of a patient's cell metastasizing to the brain. Preliminary data suggests we may use this platform to brain metastatic behavior in 24-72 hrs. We have demonstrated that we can classify non-brain seeking and brain seeking cell lines based on phenotypic metrics such as migration, extravasation, shape and volume with a positive predictive value of 0.9. This study will validate the performance of this platform on patient cells. Further we aim to understand what components of the brain stromal space promote brain metastasis to further improve the performance of this technology and identify candidates that could be targeted by therapeutics to prevent metastasis in patients that have been identified as at risk. In summary, we propose a unique approach to measure the individual metastatic potential of tumor cells spatially and temporally. This work will result in both improved clinical stratification and, downstream from it, in a more robust set of targetable pathways for prevention of brain metastasis from breast and other primary sites. Public health narrative: This grant would help develop a new clinical approach to predicting the progression of primary cancer into brain metastasis. This is the most lethal complication of breast cancer. Preventing this would save lives and improve quality of life for thousands of patients every year.",Artificial Intelligence driven prediction of brain metastasis from primary tumor sites at diagnosis,9878354,R21CA245597,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' bloodbrain barrier ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Complication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Extravasation ', ' Leakage ', ' Spillage ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Metastasis ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' Neoplasms ', ' neoplasia ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' tomography ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' Biochemical ', ' Brain Metastasis ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm to the Brain ', ' Metastatic Tumor to the Brain ', ' brain micrometastasis ', ' Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain ', ' Lesion ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Shapes ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' Pathologist ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' human tissue ', ' System ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' brain cell ', ' cancer complication ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Tumor Cell ', ' neoplastic cell ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Prognosis ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Tumor-Derived ', ' cell morphology ', ' Cellular Morphology ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' 3-D analysis ', ' 3-dimensional analysis ', ' 3D analysis ', ' Three-dimensional analysis ', ' Cancer cell line ', ' cancer type ', ' migration ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' translation strategy ', ' translational strategy ', ' translational approach ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' operation ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive marker ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' Breast Metastasis ', ' Breast cancer metastasis ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' phenotypic marker ', ' phenotypic biomarker ', ' histologic slides ', ' histological slides ', ' Clinical stratification ', ' pathology imaging ', ' organ on chip ', ' organ on a chip ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' learning classifier ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2020,218790,0.06345768244417153
"Characterization of Emca4, the Rat Ortholog of the 8q24 Breast Cancer Risk Locus Project Summary The ultimate goal of this research is to define the mechanisms through which specific endocrine and genetic risk factors contribute to breast cancer development. The focus of this proposed study is Emca4, a genetic determinant of susceptibility to 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced mammary cancer in the rat that has been mapped to rat chromosome 7 (RNO7). Data presented herein indicate that Emca4 harbors multiple genetic determinants of mammary cancer susceptibility that are orthologous to breast cancer risk loci mapped to chromosome 8q24.21. Also presented are novel data that indicate that a risk prediction model based on genotype across the Emca4 orthologous regions in the human genome can accurately distinguish cases from controls in a previously characterized case/control cohort. The primary objectives of this proposed study are to identify the cell types in which and the mechanisms through which the Emca4 variants influence development of mammary cancer. The knowledge gained will be translate to studies of human derived biospecimens to assess relevance of the data emerging from the rat models. Aim 1 is to define the mechanisms through which Emca4.1 determines susceptibility to E2-induced mammary cancer. The genes upon which the Emca4.1 variants act will be identified in defined mammary cell populations. Aim 2 is to define the mechanism through which Emca4.4 influences mammary cancer susceptibility and modifies the actions of Emca4.1. The molecular bases of the epistatic interactions between Emca4.4 and Emca4.1 on mammary cancer susceptibility and the cellular and molecular phenotypes regulated by Emca4.4 and Emca4.1 will be defined. Specific Aim 3 is to define the function(s) of Pvt1 in the rat mammary gland and its role in mammary cancer development. Attention will be focused on functionally characterizing Pvt1 promoters and exons that are impacted by endocrine and genetic factors or differ between matched normal and neoplastic mammary/breast tissues. Novel, physiologically relevant, rat models of E2-induced mammary cancer will be utilized in this research. Successful completion of the proposed studies proposed is expected to identify the cell types in which the actions of the Emca4 variants on mammary cancer susceptibility are exerted, the specific gene product(s) that confers the actions of the Emca4 variants in those cell types, and the downstream biological processes that are influenced by the functional orthologs that reside within Emca4. The information generated in these studies is expected to advance our understanding of the etiology of the luminal breast cancer subtypes. Relevance to public health: This proposed research utilizes novel and physiologically relevant rat models of 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced mammary cancer to define the mechanisms and sites of action of “functional orthologs” that reside within the Emca4 mammary cancer susceptibility locus in rat and the genetically orthologous 8q24 breast cancer risk locus in humans. By genetically linking the Emca4/8q24 functional orthologs to the biological processes that influence development of E2-induced mammary cancer, these studies will enhance our knowledge of how genetic and endocrine factors interact to influence normal mammary gland biology and mammary cancer susceptibility and will lay the foundation for development of novel strategies for breast cancer risk prediction and prevention.","Characterization of Emca4, the Rat Ortholog of the 8q24 Breast Cancer Risk Locus",9860907,R01CA204320,"['Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alternative Splicing ', ' Alternate

"Molecular mechanisms underlying circulating tumor cell aggregation Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) pose continuous and persistent threats to create new metastases albeit at an unknown, extremely low efficiency. Compared to single CTCs, clusters of multicellular CTCs possess 20-100 times higher metastatic capacity, create more polyclonal metastasis, and correlate with worse prognosis. Our previous studies identified that in addition to collective migration and cohesive shedding, tumor cell aggregation is a new mechanism for CTC cluster formation, enhancing cancer stemness and polyclonal metastasis. The objectives of this proposal are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying CD44 and PAK2-promoted CTC aggregation, identify the drivers of CTC cluster-mediated polyclonal metastasis, and therefore develop proof-of-principle targeting strategies to block lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancer, using multiple human PDXs and CTC lines as well as mouse tumor models. The collaborative team includes Dr. Huiping Liu (Northwestern University) with expertise in CTC and cancer stemness, breast oncologist Dr. Massimo Cristofanilli (Northwestern University), imaging expert Dr. Constadina Arvanitis (Northwestern University), and bioinformaticist and structural biologist Dr. Yang Shen (Texas A & M). Breast cancer is the leading cancer in women and claims about 40,000 lives in the United States every year. Metastasis account for 90% of breast cancer deaths. In order to develop effective treatments against cancer, we need to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanism underlying metastasis. Using clinical specimens, patient-derived xenograft models, and other cell line and models along with cutting-edge technology, this project aims to identify a novel mechanism critical for circulating tumor cell cluster formation and targeting strategies to block metastasis, thereby eventually contributing to a reduced mortality rate of breast cancer.",Molecular mechanisms underlying circulating

"Artificial Intelligence for Improved Breast Cancer Screening Accuracy: External Validation, Refinement, and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY Screening mammography saves lives but human interpretation alone is imperfect and is associated with significant harms including ~30,000 missed breast cancers and ~3.8 million false-positives exams each year in the U.S. alone. Traditional computer-aided detection failed to improve screening accuracy, in part due to the static nature of software trained and tested on small datasets decades ago. Recent advances in improved computer processing power, cloud-based data storage capabilities, and availability of large imaging datasets have led to renewed excitement for applying artificial intelligence (AI) to mammography interpretation. We propose a unique academic-industry partnership to validate, refine, scale, and clinically translate our proven 2D mammography AI algorithm to 3D mammography interpretation. Our team helped organize and lead the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) Digital Mammography Challenge, an open crowdsourced AI algorithmic challenge that provided >640,000 digital 2D mammogram images and associated clinical metadata to >1,200 coding teams worldwide. Our industry partner for this grant, DeepHealth, Inc., was the top performing team in the DREAM Challenge. With >50% of U.S. facilities now offering 3D mammography for screening, the 50-to-100-fold increase in imaging data represents a new critical barrier for both radiologists and AI algorithm developers. To date, there have been few publications addressing AI-enhanced interpretation of 3D mammography, the emerging screening exam of choice. We will validate our post-DREAM algorithm for 2D mammography (which currently rivals human interpretation alone) using UCLA's Athena Breast Health Network, one of the largest population-based breast imaging registries. We will enhance our 2D AI algorithm with expert radiologist supervision and examine the impact of adding novel non-imaging data parameters, including genetic mutation and tumor molecular subtype data, to help train the AI model to identify more clinically significant cancers. We will use several novel technical algorithmic approaches to scale from 2D to 3D mammography which, in our preliminary studies, have shown improved accuracy beyond radiologist interpretation alone. Finally, we will perform a series of interpretive studies to identify the optimal interface between “black box” outputs and radiologist interpreters, which remains an understudied topic. With >40 million U.S. women undergoing screening each year, seemingly small improvements in overall accuracy would still imply significantly improved population-based outcomes. In summary, we have assembled an unparalleled multidisciplinary team with expertise in machine/deep learning, breast cancer screening accuracy, medicine, oncology, radiology, imaging technology assessment, and biostatistics. We have a proven track record of strong collaboration and are well positioned to validate, enhance, scale, and translate our proven 2D AI algorithm for improved 3D mammography accuracy. Our new end user tool will help tip the balance of routine screening towards greater benefits than harms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current interpretation of screening mammography suffers from human limitations, leading to approximately 30,000 missed cancers and 3.8 million false positives exams every year in the U.S. alone. Our multidisciplinary team of experts on breast cancer screening, machine and deep learning, data science, and imaging technology assessment will validate our highly accurate 2D mammography artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that was the best performer in an international competition with >1,200 participants and then further enhance it with novel AI augmentation methods. We will then apply innovative techniques to scale the AI algorithm from 2D to 3D mammography, addressing the issue of a 50-to-100-fold increase in volumetric data with 3D exams, and then clinically translate our optimized AI 3D mammography tool through a series of interpretive accuracy studies involving experienced and inexperienced radiologists from both academic and community practices.","Artificial Intelligence for Improved Breast Cancer Screening Accuracy: External Validation, Refinement, and Clinical Translation",9912472,R37CA240403,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Computers ', ' Engineering ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Registries ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology Assessment ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Woman ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' data retrieval ', ' data storage ', ' Data Storage and Retrieval ', ' radiologist ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' International ', ' Community Practice ', ' Seminal ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' meta data ', ' Metadata ', ' Output ', ' digital ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Imaging technology ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' patient population ', ' population based ', ' industrial partnership ', ' industry partnership ', ' industry partner ', ' computer assisted detection ', ' computer aided detection ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ', ' cloud based ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' mammography screening ', ' Mammographic screening ', ' mammary imaging ', ' breast imaging ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' Data Science ', ' expression subtypes ', ' molecular sub-types ', ' molecular subsets ', ' molecular subtypes ', ' radiologic imaging ', ' radiological imaging ', ' clinical translation ', ' clinical implementation ', ' annual screening ', ' routine screening ', ' deep learning ', ' long short term memory ', ' algorithm development ', ' smart algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R37,2020,547285,0.19891642638652524
"Integrating novel GIS and GPS data to assess the impact of built environments on changes in BMI, physical activity and cancer-related biomarkers in two successful weight loss interventions in women at In 2018, 266,120 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected. The Breast Cancer and Environment Research Program, funded by NIEHS and NCI, identified a need to better understand environmental exposures to inform cancer prevention efforts. Further, Just in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) employ temporal and spatial cues to prompt behavior change, but little is known about spatial predictors of behaviors at the minute level and beyond home neighborhoods. Two successful weight loss trials in women at risk for breast cancer, conducted in harmony under the NCI-funded Transdisciplinary Research and Energetics in Cancer Center, offer a unique opportunity to examine the health impacts of changing environmental exposures in a heterogeneous sample. One trial focused on older breast cancer survivors, the other on women across the age range at increased breast cancer risk due to their obesity status. The studies included numerous identical measures at baseline and 6 months, including biomarkers, GPS and accelerometer measurements, and perceived environment surveys. We propose to investigate the relationship between minute level objective GIS measured walkability, greenspace, pollution and food environments and changes in BMI, physical activity (PA), and cancer related biomarkers. Few studies have assessed the impact of the built environment on weight loss interventions using objective daily measures, and none included biomarkers of cancer risk. Further, no studies have employed novel GPS measures of total environment exposure that can change as behaviors change in an intervention. Assessing the effects of built environments on intervention outcomes and investigating changes in exposure over time will provide more causal evidence to inform the policy agenda. Most data on built environment and health are cross sectional. We need longitudinal, causal evidence to support policy changes in urban design that will have lasting impact on large population groups and those at risk, recommended by the WHO, IOM and CDC. In addition, we will use estimates of exposure change from the current study to simulate the potential impact of JITAIs and to identify decision points, decision rules and tailoring variables for future interventions. The current study will geocode each GPS coordinate (42 million), integrate built environment data on walkability, greenspace, pollution and food environments in GIS using validated integrated data analysis techniques, and investigate whether the environment influences changes in biomarkers, BMI and PA. The Ecological model posits that factors at the individual, interpersonal, and community level can influence behavior and health. These analyses will assess the multi-level predictors, while adjusting for interpersonal and individual covariates. Results will be disseminated to existing community partners from cancer, aging and transportation planning to inform local advocacy efforts.

"Development and Clinical Implementation of an Artificial Intelligence Tool to Predict Risk of Upgrade of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This proposal presents a five-year career development plan focused on data science and artificial intelligence (AI) and the application of AI to improve outcomes in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The candidate is a Radiologist at MGH and an Assistant Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School. The proposal builds upon the candidate’s previous research and clinical experiences in breast imaging and also upon a strong ongoing research partnership between MGH and MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). The candidate’s long-term career goal is to become a leader in academic breast imaging by investigating and applying AI to critical areas in breast cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment. The proposed research project and advanced didactic training at Harvard and MIT will position the candidate with a unique set of knowledge and skills in data science and AI that will enable her to develop an independent cancer research program that focuses on applications of AI to breast imaging.  The incidence of DCIS has dramatically increased over the past 40 years, with an estimated 63,960 diagnoses in 2018. Current guidelines recommend that DCIS be treated with surgery, radiation, and endocrine therapy, but there remains considerable controversy over whether this regimen represents overtreatment for those women with indolent non-hazardous DCIS. Given concerns about overtreatment, there are currently three randomized controlled trials underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of active surveillance versus standard treatment, and critical to the implementation of active surveillance programs is careful selection of eligible patients. The goal of the proposed project is to develop a robust AI tool that incorporates clinical data, mammographic imaging, and biopsy histopathology slides for pre-operatively predicting the risk of concurrent invasive cancer in women with DCIS. The tool will be built using machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. Incorporation of mammographic imaging and histopathology slides into the AI tool will be supported by the MGH & BWH Center for Clinical Data Science (CCDS) and the MGH Department of Pathology. After development and validation of the AI tool based on a retrospective cohort of 1,400 women diagnosed with DCIS at MGH, the tool will then be integrated into MGH’s mammography information system and used to categorize new cases of DCIS. The specific aims are: (1) to develop a robust AI tool that predicts the risk of upgrade of DCIS diagnosed by image-guided core needle biopsy to invasive cancer at surgery and (2) to implement and evaluate the AI tool in clinical practice. Use of this tool could identify the subset of women who are appropriate candidates for active surveillance, decrease the morbidity and costs of overtreatment, and support more targeted and precise treatment options for women diagnosed with DCIS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Every year, more than 60,000 women are diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which is also known as noninvasive or Stage 0 breast cancer, and undergo an aggressive treatment regimen involving surgery, radiation, and hormonal therapy. We propose to develop and implement a robust tool, using artificial intelligence, to pre-operatively predict the risk that DCIS will upgrade to invasive cancer at surgery. Development of a highly reliable prognostic tool could identify the subset of women who may not need aggressive treatment, decrease the morbidity and costs associated with overtreatment, and support more targeted and precise treatment options for women diagnosed with DCIS.",Development and Clinical Implementation of an Artificial Intelligence Tool to Predict Risk of Upgrade of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ,9974496,K08CA241365,"['Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' DCIS ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Hormone Receptor ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Medical Imaging ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Indolent ', ' Development Plans ', ' radiologist ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Slide ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' professor ', ' computer science ', ' Histopathology ', ' Adjuvant Therapy ', ' skills ', ' Duct ', ' Duct (organ) structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Institution ', ' Core Needle Biopsy ', ' Core Biopsy ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Data ', ' Surveillance Program ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Carcinoma Cell ', ' Malignant Epithelial Cell ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' mammographic breast density ', ' Mammographic Density ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' cancer invasiveness ', ' prospective ', ' tumor ', ' aggressive treatment ', ' aggressive therapy ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' clinical practice ', ' Regimen ', ' mammary imaging ', ' breast imaging ', ' image guidance ', ' image guided ', ' prognostic tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Data Science ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' improved outcome ', ' predictive tools ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' Risk stratification ', ' surgical outcome ', ' surgery outcome ', ' clinical implementation ', ' over-treatment ', ' overtreatment ', ' deep learning ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' random forest ', ' surgery risk ', ' surgical risk ', ' smart algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' complex data  ', ' data diversity ', ' diverse data ', ' clinical center ', ' patient health record ', ' patient medical record ', ' patient health information ', ' ']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2020,259979,0.12955745943521893
"Baseline Symptoms and Adherence to Oral Breast Cancer Therapy among Older Women For the >200,000 older women who develop hormone receptor positive breast cancer yearly, adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) for at least five years increases overall survival. Yet almost half of patients prescribed AET fail to take all their pills. Education- and reminder-based studies in this and a number of other settings have had disappointingly small effects on adherence, and more complex interventions have proven difficult to sustain. In this proposal we seek a better understanding of the symptoms that women describe as major barriers to AET adherence. We draw on prior research suggesting that preexisting symptoms may play an important role in patients’ experience with AET. Our proposal fills crucial gaps in our understanding by examining older and less selected subjects treated in a usual care practice, and by using a measure that is already routinely collected across the United States. Specifically, we will use the National Comprehensive Cancer Network’s Distress Thermometer (DT) and its accompanying problem list, which have previously been shown to reveal a high burden of symptoms among older women with breast cancer but have not been examined in association with AET or while accounting for the wide spectrum of comorbid conditions of older women. Most cancer centers administer the DT and problem list at diagnosis or earlier in care, increasing their value for informing early intervention to help women continue their AET. We will investigate whether the DT and problem list are predictive of AET discontinuation among older women, with specific aims as follows: Aim 1 To examine the association of patient-reported distress at diagnosis with early discontinuation of AET. We will utilize electronic health record data from a cohort of incident postmenopausal hormone receptor positive breast cancer patients to examine the association of the DT (scored 0 to 10) measured at diagnosis with AET discontinuation in time-to-event analyses, accounting for age, osteoarthritis, and other comorbidities, and other breast cancer treatments. Aim 2. To explore the association of patient-reported symptoms at diagnosis with discontinuation of AET. In the same cohort and using the same general approach, we will explore AET discontinuation and a) patient-reported overall symptom count based on DT problem list) and b) symptom clusters (e.g., fatigue, sleep, concentration). We will use both standard regression and an innovative application of machine learning using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. With this approach, we will produce immediately actionable findings to improve adherence outcomes, by providing a means of identifying high-risk patients who are the primary targets for the development of new interventions. It could also be an important model for other conditions that are treated with aggressive treatment regimens in older patients, informing care for a large number of older patients. Over 200,000 older women develop hormone receptor positive breast cancer each year. We will examine whether the symptoms patients have even prior to treatments are related to completing five years of necessary estrogen-blocking breast cancer medications. This study will provide new information about whether preexisting symptoms and/or other factors are important barriers to patients, information that is essential to developing new ways to support patients in taking their medications.",Baseline Symptoms and Adherence to Oral Breast Cancer Therapy among Older Women,9995306,R21AG064875,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Arthralgia ', ' Joint Pain ', ' Attention ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Interview ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' poor sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' Tamoxifen ', ' Thermometers ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Post-Menopause ', ' Post-menopausal Period ', ' Postmenopausal Period ', ' post-menopausal ', ' postmenopausal ', ' Postmenopause ', ' Distress ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Early Intervention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' Androstenedione Aromatase Inhibitor ', ' Estrogen Synthase Inhibitor ', ' Estrogen Synthetase Inhibitor ', ' Aromatase Inhibitors ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' pill ', ' therapy adherence ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Breast Cancer Treatment ', ' Data ', ' NCCN ', ' National Comprehensive Cancer Network ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Therapy Clinical Trials ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Vasomotor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic data ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' older women ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' aggressive treatment ', ' aggressive therapy ', ' clinical care ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' clinical practice ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Cancer therapy ', ' symptom cluster ', ' secondary analysis ', ' hormone receptor-positive ', ' side effect ', ' regression trees ', ' adjuvant endocrine therapy ', ' ']",NIA,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2020,234000,0.1592943403376844
"Predictive Modeling of the EGFR-MAPK pathway for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients The EGFR-MAPK pathway is a key signaling pathway in human Triple Negative Beast Cancers (TNBC). We propose to leverage genomic and proteomic data from a rich animal model system, and 2 human clinical trials, to build predictive models of the EGFR-MAPK signaling pathway activity for TNBC patients. The heterogeneity of TNBC has hindered previous development of predictive pathway-based computational models because most approaches are based on experimental data from a single cell line or animal model that is then extrapolated to fit multiple tumor subtypes. Our approach is to use a diverse experimental model system that reflects the heterogeneous disease subtypes, and then use two distinct and complementary methods to build the computational model. We will simultaneously use mechanistic and statistical modeling approaches, at a variety of scales, that incorporate data from drug treated tumors and cell lines, assayed for gene expression, DNA copy number, DNA mutations, and protein kinome activity. Lastly, we will test these computational models on human tumors to evaluate their predictive performance. Project Narrative Breast cancer is not one disease, but instead, represents multiple diseases. Each of these unique subtypes requires a different therapeutic approach, thus, determining which new drugs will benefit each disease subtype is critical. To address this need, we are focusing on one of the most therapeutically difficult to treat breast cancer subtypes, namely Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBC). We also propose to develop a mathematical representation of a key growth regulating pathway (i.e. EGFR-MAPK) that will predict its activity in TNBC patients, and thus could be used to guide therapies to those patients who have this pathway active within their tumors. We will ultimately test our predictive model on human tumors coming from clinical trials, and if successful, we will have developed a new biomarker for guiding TNBC patient treatments through the use of objective mathematical models",Predictive Modeling of the EGFR-MAPK pathway for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients,9928400,U01CA238475,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' malignant

"Radiotherapy-associated breast cancer: machine learning on genotypes to predict individualized risk SUMMARY Risk of developing contralateral breast cancer is a major concern among breast cancer survivors, especially for those who received radiotherapy for a first primary breast cancer. The risk of developing radiation-associated contralateral breast cancer (RCBC) is further increased among those who were exposed to radiation at an early age. Several genotyping studies have shown that variation in the individual risk of developing RCBC is associated with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic variants. However, these studies have mainly analyzed a limited set of target/candidate SNPs that had been associated with general primary breast cancer in prior studies. This approach, building predictive models based on a small set of SNPs, has made marginal progress in distinguishing individual risk of RCBC. To the contrary, complex phenotypes or traits are likely the result of interactions of many biological sub-systems, most of which individually provide small effect size to predictive models, incrementally improving risk prediction. We have recently developed novel machine learning methods that use genome-wide SNPs to build patient-specific risk models of radiation-induced toxicity. These models use hundreds of SNPs in a nonlinear fashion and can be used to identify key biological correlates. Our long-term goal is to develop a clinical decision support tool that can be used to guide radiotherapy treatment decisions based on individual risk of RCBC. To improve patient-specific risk prediction of RCBC, we propose to apply these innovative methods to a rich dataset of the Women’s Environmental Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) Study. Under SA1: Genome-wide genotyping of the WECARE Study II, as part of this grant, we will complete genome-wide association studies (GWAS) genotyping of 1626 samples from the WECARE Study II. Under SA2.1: Predictive modeling and biological analysis, we will apply our novel machine learning methods to the combined WECARE Study I and II to design a predictive model of RCBC risk in a young subpopulation treated with radiotherapy, using GWAS genotyping, clinical, and radiation data. We will also use bioinformatics methods to identify key biological correlates associated with RCBC risk. Under SA2.2: Comparison of biological correlates between subgroups, we will further investigate biological processes associated with radiation-unrelated contralateral breast cancer for the combined cohort in the WECARE Study I and II who did not receive radiotherapy. The resulting biological correlates will be compared with those found in SA2.1 for radiotherapy-treated women to better understand RCBC-specific biological mechanisms. Our model validation using an independent series of childhood cancer survivors who have developed radiation-associated breast cancer will enable us to examine the reliability and reproducibility of the model as a decision-making tool. If the RCBC risk model is validated, it will provide a clinical guide to identify high-risk patients who may need altered radiotherapy techniques (e.g., proton therapy), which offer reduced scatter dose. NARRATIVE Young women who receive radiotherapy are at increased risk for radiation-associated breast cancer. We have developed innovative modeling methods to build a predictive model of radiation-associated breast cancer risk based on patient genetic profiles using the unique, multi- center WECARE Study dataset for this study. If successful with rigorous validation on an independent dataset, this project will result in a clinical tool that could be used to inform breast cancer treatment decisions for young women at increased risk of radiation-associated breast cancer.",Radiotherapy-associated breast cancer: machine learning on genotypes to predict individualized risk,9878491,R21CA234752,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Decision Making ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Female ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Methods ', ' Neoplasms ', ' neoplasia ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Radiation therapy ', ' Radiotherapeutics ', ' Radiotherapy ', ' radiation treatment ', ' radio-therapy ', ' treatment with radiation ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Radiation Scattering ', ' Woman ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant childhood cancer ', ' cancer in a child ', ' cancer in children ', ' child with cancer ', ' childhood malignancy ', ' children with cancer ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' pediatric malignancy ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' proton therapy ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Radiation Dose ', ' Radiation Dose Unit ', ' environmental radiation ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' dosimetry ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Treatment Factor ', ' cancer genetics ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Radiation-Induced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Radiation-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' radiation related cancer ', ' radiation related neoplasm/cancer ', ' Radiation-Induced Cancer ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Thorace ', ' Thoracic ', ' Thorax ', ' Chest ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Environment-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Environmental Cancer ', ' Environmental Malignant Neoplasm ', ' environment related cancer ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Adverse Late Effects ', ' Late Effects ', ' Dose ', ' Age-Years ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Breast Cancer Treatment ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Childhood Cancer Survivor Study ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' life-time risk ', ' lifetime risk ', ' Validation ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genetic profiling ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' pediatric cancer survivor ', ' childhood cancer survivor ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' biological systems ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' adolescent woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' young woman ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' Breast Cancer survivor ', ' model building ', ' support tools ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' Contra-lateral Breast ', ' Contralateral Breast ', ' radiation risk ', ' data resource ', ' recruit ', ' clinical decision support ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' personalized predictions ', ' random forest ', ' bio-informatics tool ', ' bioinformatics tool ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R21,2020,293870,0.33464403167294177
"Predicting Long-Term Chemotherapy-Related Cognitive Impairment ABSTRACT Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) affects an estimated 60% of patients, negatively impacting quality of life. Currently, there is no established method for predicting which patients will develop CRCI. This information could be practice-changing by assisting clinicians with treatment decision-making for individual patients. We have shown that the brain network (“connectome”) is significantly altered in patients with CRCI. Therefore, we measured the connectome is patients prior to any treatment and demonstrated that these connectome properties could be used in combination with machine learning to predict 1 year post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment with 100% accuracy. The proposed project aims to test this preliminary prediction model in a new, larger sample with the overarching goal of validating its use for clinical practice. We will enroll 100 newly diagnosed patients with primary breast cancer scheduled for adjuvant chemotherapy who will be assessed prior to any treatment, including surgery with general anesthesia, 1 month after chemotherapy treatment and again 1 year later. We will also enroll matched healthy female controls who will be assessed at yoked intervals. We will combine these data with retrospective data we obtained during a prior study for a total sample of 150 in each group. Data from healthy controls will be used to determine impairment status in patients with breast cancer and to provide a template of typical connectome organization for comparison. We hypothesize that our machine learning model will accurately predict 1 year post- chemotherapy cognitive impairment and that it will be more accurate than a model that includes patient- related and medical variables alone. We will also examine longitudinal changes in connectome organization associated with impairment subtypes (i.e. persistent vs. late onset impairment) as well as changes in specific functional networks (e.g. default mode, salience, executive-attention and sensory- motor networks). This information will provide novel insights regarding the neural mechanisms of CRCI and may also help us refine our prediction models. RELEVANCE A significant proportion of women who receive chemotherapy for breast cancer will experience long- term problems with brain function, such as thinking, memory and attention that reduce quality of life and extend disease-related disability. The proposed study aims to validate a model for predicting who will develop long-term cognitive impairment and to examine the underlying causes of this impairment.

"Predicting risk of cardiotoxicity among young and emerging adult breast cancer patients from treatment to survivorship Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is prevalent among breast cancer survivors. This is due to shared risk factors between CVD and cancer, but also that breast cancer therapies are often cardiotoxic, which may later cause heart failure (HF). Cardiotoxicity from breast cancer chemotherapy affects between 10-20% of patients with enhanced risk in the presence of traditional CVD risk factors. However, there is a significant gap in our knowledge of cardiotoxicity among the rapidly growing population of young and emerging adult (YEA) breast cancer survivors, which comprise 5-12% of all breast cancer diagnoses. As survival from breast cancer increases, exposure to cardiotoxic chemotherapies at a younger age may enhance HF risk among YEA breast cancer survivors. Moreover, YEA breast cancer patients are more likely to have gene mutations that may also impair cardiac tissue function combined with a unique pattern of health behaviors and CVD risk factors. However, we are currently unable to predict which patients are at highest risk of cardiotoxicity. Studies suggest that gene expression may refine identification of women at increased risk of cardiotoxicity. To date, no studies examined whether combining gene expression and genetic mutations with CVD risk factors can identify YEA patients at increased risk of cardiotoxic effects of chemotherapy. To address this issue, I will complete the following specific aims: 1) Develop a predictive model combining psychosocial and traditional CVD risk factors to identify YEA breast cancer patients at increased risk of cardiotoxicity as defined by a decline in global longitudinal strain (GLS) or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); 2) Investigate if the risk factor profile at diagnosis is associated with trajectory of GLS and LVEF during and after breast cancer treatment; and 3) investigate the impact of molecular biomarkers to risk prediction models. We will recruit a longitudinal cohort of n=300 YEA breast cancer patients treated at Northwestern Medicine. Among these participants, in a nested case-control design, we will select cases diagnosed with decline in GLS during chemotherapy (n=50) with age-matched controls without cardiotoxicity (n=50). For all participants, we will combine electronic health record (EHR) data with psychosocial and traditional CVD risk factors at three timepoints. For the nested case-control study, we will additionally measure gene expression at two timepoints. This directly informs my short-term career development goals to 1) Gain experience in HF and CVD etiology, epidemiology, and risk factors; 2) Develop skills in machine learning and bioinformatics approaches for prediction; and 3) Refine health informatics methods to integrate EHR with epidemiologic and molecular data. The skills and pilot data generated through this K01 will enable me to address the NHLBI compelling question (5.CQ.10) to reduce cardiac morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors. I will thus achieve my long-term career goal to identify and intervene on the CVD threats to the health and longevity of YEA cancer survivors. Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer among women globally, while cardiovascular disease has become a leading cause of death among breast cancer survivors. Commonly used breast cancer treatments are known to cause cardiotoxicity, but the majority of studies have not examined the growing population of young and emerging adult breast cancer patients. The objective of this study is to develop a personalized model of psychosocial factors, traditional CVD risk factors, and molecular markers that predicts risk of cardiotoxicity among YEA breast cancer patients.",Predicting risk of cardiotoxicity among young and emerging adult breast cancer patients from treatment to survivorship,9953579,K01HL152009,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Animals ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Echocardiography ', ' Echocardiogram ', ' Transthoracic Echocardiography ', ' heart sonography ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart Injuries ', ' cardiac injury ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"3D Super-Resolution Ultrasound Imaging for Cancer Detection and Treatment Monitoring PROJECT SUMMARY Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the standard of care for treatment of locally advanced breast cancer, which is a major clinical issue. Access to inexpensive and noninvasive methods to determine early treatment response are essential to determine if a chosen anticancer therapeutic regimen is efficacious. Tumor angiogenesis is a key biomarker of breast cancer growth and metastasis. This tumor microvascularity is known to exhibit distinct perfusion characteristics and morphologic features during the early stages of breast tumor development which fundamentally change during a positive response to neoadjuvant treatment. The overarching goal of this research project is to develop an innovative three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution (SR-US) imaging system and new image processing solutions to considerably improve our ability to perform in vivo quantitative analysis of tumor angiogenic networks. The first aim of this project involves optimization of 3D SR-US imaging functionality on a programmable US scanner equipped with a custom 1024-element (32 x 32) matrix array transducer. The second aim involves the development of new open-source SR-US image processing software for performing motion correction and quantitative analysis of tumor perfusion and microvascular morphology features in 3D space. In the third aim, we will evaluate the use of angiogenic biomarkers extracted from 3D SR- US images as a quantitative basis for distinguishing healthy from diseased tissue volumes in a transgenic animal model of breast cancer. We will also assess the use of in vivo 3D SR-US imaging for detection of early tumor response to neoadjuvant treatment using the same animal model.

"Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications Low prevalence searches form an important and problematic class of visual search tasks. These are tasks where the search target is rare. Many socially important tasks like airport security or cancer screening are low prevalence tasks. Previous work, much of it from our lab, has shown that low prevalence can have undesirable effects. Most notably, miss (false negative) errors are markedly elevated at low prevalence. This is a clear problem if the purpose of the search is to detect something rare but important like cancer or a terrorist threat. Our previous work has documented this pattern of increased miss errors in a number of expert domains including cytology (cervical cancer screening), airport baggage screening, and breast cancer screening. False alarm (false positive) error rates typically decline at low prevalence, moving in the opposite direction from miss errors. This indicates a shift in the observer’s decision criterion. At low prevalence, observers become more reluctant to call something a target. Several studies – ours and others - have shown that this “conservative” criterion shift is not adequate to explain the entire prevalence effect. Wolfe and VanWert (2010) developed a “Dual- Threshold” model that better captures the important aspects of the prevalence effect data by proposing two effects of low prevalence: (1) the conservative shift in the criterion for deciding if an attended item is a target, and (2) a lowering of the “quitting threshold.” The quitting threshold determines when observers end a search. Quitting too soon also increases the chance that the observer will miss a target. Prevalence effects have been studied in experimental isolation from other aspects of search. However, in tasks like breast cancer screening, other factors interact with prevalence. The four projects in the present proposal each investigate one of these interactions. Project 1 examines the relationship of prevalence to the “vigilance decrements” that are seen as time elapses in a task. In search, observers must maintain an internal, mental representation of the search target (or targets). Project 2 is concerned with the impact of prevalence on these “target templates”. Advances in artificial intelligence (notably deep learning) are producing tools to assist expert searchers. However, once deployed, these AI tools have been less effective than theory predicts. Project 3 tests the hypothesis that part of the problem is another side-effect of low prevalence and the project tests a potential intervention. Finally, clinicians, searching for one type of target (e.g. pneumonia) are supposed to report signs of other possible problems (e.g. lung cancer). Project 4 probes the role of prevalence in the failure to report such “incidental findings”. Again, we test several interventions. This is “use-inspired, basic research” whose results will provide guidance for experts performing socially important low prevalence tasks. Important tasks like breast cancer screening involve visual search for rare (“low prevalence”)  targets but, unfortunately, low prevalence is known to increase the percentage of targets that are  missed even by well-trained experts. In a task like breast cancer screening, prevalence interacts  with other factors like observer vigilance or the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence tool.  This proposal studies four of these interactions with the goal of counteracting the malign effects  of prevalence; thus making it possible for experts to perform their critical search tasks more  effectively.",Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications,9885223,R01EY017001,"['mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Security ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' mental representation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' deep learning ', ' side effect ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cytology ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Joints ', ' Methods ', ' Paper ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Prevalence Study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Flecks ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Visual ', ' Trust ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' analog ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Performance ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' vigilance ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Incidental Findings ', ' Modeling ', ' visual search ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' ']",NEI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,447500,0.0946531857805289
"Combination FGFR4 and ER-Targeted Therapy for Invasive Lobular Carcinoma Project Summary Even though invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) accounts for 10-15% of the breast cancer seen in the US, there remains much to be learned about the unique nature of this disease. For example, patients with ILC are likely to have tumors with expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ER), a biomarker of good prognosis. Yet, patients with ER+ ILC have worse long-term outcomes compared to patients with the more commonly studied subtype of ER+ invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). The standard treatment regimen for ER+ disease includes endocrine therapy, so the big picture focus of this grant asks: why do some ILC patients have a worse outcome than expected on endocrine therapy, and for those patients, what additional treatments can we provide? This grant aims to assess the effect of FGFR4 expression on cell survival and signaling in vitro, identify biomarkers for FGFR4 activation in silico, and test the efficacy of FGFR4 inhibition on clinical samples ex vivo. Methods include 1) FGFR4 inhibition with shRNAs and small-molecule inhibitors, 2) RNA-Sequencing, 3) machine-learning, and 4) explant models of ILC patient tumors. The ultimate goal of the proposed aims is to provide rationale for specific combination targeted therapy in patients with lobular breast cancer, in accordance with the mission statement of the NCI. Project Narrative The goal of this research is to identify why endocrine therapy has lasting benefits for only a subset of women with breast cancer. The proposed studies include RNA-Sequencing to understand how molecular changes impact survival outcomes. Results of this and future research will complement findings from ongoing clinical trials to identify the best combination of targeted therapy for each individual with breast cancer.",Combination FGFR4 and ER-Targeted Therapy for Invasive Lobular Carcinoma,9837419,F30CA203154,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' cell growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cultured Cells ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor ', ' DNA Synthesis Factor ', ' Endothelial Cell Growth Factor ', ' FGF ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor Gene Family ', ' Fibroblast Growth Regulatory Factor ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' In Vitro ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Tamoxifen ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Woman ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors ', ' FGF Receptors ', ' FGF-R ', ' FGFR ', ' Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Family ', ' Mediating ', ' Clinical ', ' Lobular ', ' Lobular Adenocarcinoma ', ' Lobular Breast Carcinoma ', ' Lobular Carcinoma ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Dependence ', ' Endocrine ', ' experience ', ' ERalpha ', ' ERα ', ' Estradiol Receptor alpha ', ' Estradiol Receptor α ', ' Estrogen Receptor α ', ' Estrogen Receptor alpha ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Proteomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' kinase inhibitor ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' FGFR4 ', ' JTK2 Gene ', ' TKF Gene ', ' FGFR4 gene ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma ', ' infiltrating ductal carcinoma ', ' invasive ductal adenocarcinoma ', ' invasive ductal carcinoma ', ' infiltrating duct carcinoma ', ' Carcinoma Cell ', ' Malignant Epithelial Cell ', ' Molecular ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' Outcome ', ' migration ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' shRNA ', ' short hairpin RNA ', ' small hairpin RNA ', ' transcriptomics ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' tumor ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' efficacy testing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differential expression ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' targeted agent ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' small molecule inhibitor ', ' survival outcome ', ' 3D cell culture ', ' 3D culture ', ' three dimensional cell culture ', ' clinical development ', ' translational cancer research ', ' in silico ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F30,2020,45273,0.25628101202967923
"3-D modeling-based decision support for optimizing quality of life following breast reconstruction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast reconstruction is a central component of the breast cancer treatment process for many women. The purpose of breast reconstruction is to recreate a breast form that is satisfying to the patient, facilitating her psychosocial adjustment o living as a breast cancer survivor. Decisions about breast reconstruction can be difficult and overwhelming for many women due to the number of options available and conflicting values and preferences. The long-term goal of our research is to enhance the consultation process for women undergoing breast reconstruction surgery. Our vision is a decision support system that will enable breast cancer patients, in consultation with their healthcare providers, to choose a reconstruction strategy with maximal potential to optimize psychosocial adjustment. This system for shared decision-making will use quantitative models to tailor the presentation of patient-specific information about breast reconstruction outcomes. Three common features of decision support systems are the knowledge base; the methodology for combining that knowledge with patient-specific information; and the communication mechanisms. With recent NIH support, we established a unique knowledge base through a longitudinal study of 500 women who underwent breast reconstruction. We also developed preliminary computational models for combining that knowledge base with patient-specific data. Our models are parameterized by experimental, clinical, and psychosocial data and employ techniques from 3D image analysis, biomechanical modeling and simulation, machine learning, and decision analysis. In the proposed project, we will develop predictive algorithms for combining the knowledge base and patient- specific information, and we will develop communication mechanisms both for gathering necessary patient- specific information and for delivering information about the decision basis to the patient and her multidisciplinary care team.

"A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis The long-term goal of this project is to develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis, thus aiding in improving the quality of both cancer research and clinical practice. Since diagnostic errors can cause altered treatment recommendations and significant patient harm, tools that semi-automate the diagnostic process to improve efficiency, reliability and accuracy are thus needed by both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. Our work will produce a set of machine-learning tools to identify regions of interest (ROI), classify these regions into the full spectrum of diagnostic categories (ranging from benign, to pre-invasive/risk lesions, to invasive cancer), and culminate in the development of a unified software package for cancer diagnosis that can be shared among cancer researchers and clinicians. Our aims are: Aim 1: Regions of Interest. Produce 1a) a ROI finder classifier and associated tools for use by researchers or pathologists for automatic identification of potential ROIs on whole slide images of breast biopsy slides and 1b) a ROI analysis classifier and associated tools that can point out image regions that tend to cause misdiagnosis and produce suitable warnings as to why such regions may either be distractors or indicate cancer. Aim 2: Diagnosis. Produce a diagnostic classifier and associated tools that can not only suggest the potential diagnosis of a whole slide image, but can also produce the reasons for the diagnosis in terms of regions on the image, their color, their texture, and their structure. Aim 3: Dissemination. Develop a unified software package containing this suite of tools, so they can be easily shared and provided (standalone and through the existing PIIP platform) to both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. In addition to specific classifiers for breast cancer research, we will provide the methodology to train related classifiers for other biopsy- diagnosed cancers, such as melanoma, prostate, lung, and colon cancer. Our highly innovative diagnostic tools will include our state-of-the-art (2017) feature extraction and machine learning methods as opposed to the generic image management tools of the current ITCR projects. Our classifiers were trained on a unique data set acquired in a carefully designed breast cancer research study, so they are immediately useful in the breast cancer domain, but designed to be easily retrained for other data sets and cancers. The addition of our unique multi-disciplinary team and these tools to the ITCR program will be an important aid to cancer research and will improve the process of diagnosis for clinicians. Quality medical care requires an accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic errors lead to lower quality research and can lead to reduced quality of care and inappropriate treatment decisions that result in harm to patients. Our team will develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis and will share these tools with cancer researchers and pathologists on a publicly available platform.",A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis,9997819,U01CA231782,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Carcinoma ', ' Epithelial cancer ', ' Malignant Epithelial Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Epithelial Tumors ', ' epithelial carcinoma ', ' Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' DCIS ', ' Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Intraductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Infiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Non-Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast ', ' Non-Invasive Intraductal Breast Adenocarcinoma ', ' Color ', ' E-learning ', ' computer-assisted instruction ', ' computer-based education ', ' computer-based instruction ', ' computer-based learning ', ' computer-based training ', ' digital education ', ' digital learning ', ' eLearning ', ' electronic learning ', ' internet-assisted education ', ' internet-based training ', ' multimedia learning ', ' on-line education ', ' on-line learning ', ' online education ', ' online learning ', ' technology-enhanced learning ', ' virtual learning ', ' web-based instruction ', ' web-based training ', ' computer program ', ' computer programming ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Errors ', ' diagnosis errors ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Glass ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Marketing ', ' Mastectomy ', ' Mammectomy ', ' melanoma ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Pathology ', ' Surgical Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Second Opinions ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant - descriptor ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' programs ', ' Slide ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' experience ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Histopathology ', ' Structure ', ' Graph ', ' research study ', ' Categories ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' cancer in the colon ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Atypia ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' breast cancer diagnosis ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' digital ', ' imaging informatics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cancer invasiveness ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' clinical practice ', ' screening ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Breast biopsy ', ' imaging system ', ' whole slide imaging ', ' digital pathology ', ' pathology imaging ', ' feature extraction ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U01,2020,345812,0.1804259094792704
"Deep interpretation of mammographic images in breast cancer screening Project Summary/Abstract Screening mammography has been shown effective in early detection of breast cancer and in reducing mortality. However, controversies and challenges still remain, with primary concerns on personal breast cancer risk prediction from mammographic parenchymal markers, high recall and benign biopsy rates, and improving radiologists’ clinical reading practices. Computerized methods have been developed in these regards, with the goal of providing computer assistance to radiologists in making clinical decisions. While successful, the accuracy of these methods is subject to appropriate data representation (i.e., image features) that requires strong feature engineering. A newly emerged artificial intelligence technique, called deep learning, represents a breakthrough in machine learning paradigms, and has revolutionized computer image analysis and many other applications in the past few years. Breast cancer screening yields a huge amount of mammogram data that requires in-depth interpretation to improve current clinical workup. The goal of this study is to develop and optimize a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based computational approach to improve mammographic imaging trait identification, analysis, and interpretation and to use this approach to address accurate breast cancer risk prediction and reduce false recall rates. This study will be the first to examine the effects of the revolutionary deep learning technique on performing in-depth interpretation of big screening mammogram data, aimed at improving clinical practice. The new risk biomarkers will contribute to providing more accurate risk prediction than currently available. The recall-decision model will help reduce false recalls (associated with potential benign biopsy results), and better understand radiologists’ reading behaviors. Overall, the CNN-based approach will optimize the clinical utility of screening mammography and has a high likelihood to translate to the clinic for breast cancer screening. Public Health Relevance Statement (Project Narrative): We propose to apply a revolutionary deep learning approach to mine a big data of digital mammograms for improving mammogram data analysis and interpretation. This study will provide a computer-aided deep learning toolkit for improving breast cancer risk prediction and for aiding individual radiologists in their clinical decision-making on recalls. By introducing this newly emerged powerful machine learning technique to the clinical side of breast cancer screening, it will contribute to improving personal breast cancer risk prediction and reducing unnecessary recalls. The study will optimize the clinical utility of screening mammograms and has a high likelihood to translate to the clinic for breast cancer screening.",Deep interpretation of mammographic images in breast cancer screening,9954013,R01CA218405,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Biopsy ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Decision Making ', ' Engineering ', ' Goals ', ' Image Enhancement ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Learning ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' mammographic examinations ', ' mammographic exams ', ' Manuals ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' mortality ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Reading ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Psychological Transfer ', ' learning transfer ', ' training transfer ', ' Translating ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Decision Modeling ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Image Analyses ', ' image evaluation ', ' image interpretation ', ' Image Analysis ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Lesion ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' radiologist ', ' Breast Cancer Early Screening ', ' Breast Cancer Early Detection ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' Performance ', ' trait ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Appearance ', ' Digital Mammography ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Breast cancer screening ', ' Breast screening ', ' mammary cancer detection ', ' mammary screening ', ' Breast Cancer Detection ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Data ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' breast density ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' Network-based ', ' public health relevance ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' screening ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' mammography screening ', ' Mammographic screening ', ' mammary imaging ', ' breast imaging ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' interactive tool ', ' deep learning based neural network ', ' deep learning neural network ', ' deep neural net ', ' deep neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,357994,0.3165235570438733
