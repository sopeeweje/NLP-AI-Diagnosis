"CONTEXT INFORMATION IN AUTOMATED CERVICAL SMEAR ANALYSIS The overall aim of this project is to improve automated cervical smear image analysis techniques sufficiently to:  1) routinely provide additional diagnostic information to supplement that provided by human visual examination, and 2) provide accurate, cost effective prescreening capabilities.  By furnishing additional quantitative diagnostic information, such automated systems would permit the practicing cytopathologist to make more accurate and refined diagnostic judgements, which would lead to improved patient management.  By providing a practical prescreening capability, such systems would increase the efficiency and efficacy of health care delivery.  Current automated cervical smear analysis research employs only the analysis of isolated cells, and practical automated analysis is not yet a reality.  The primary contribution of this project will be the completion of development and testing of image analysis techniques that extract information from cells and other objects as seen in the context of the ""background"" of the smear.  Specifically, cells, cell clusters, bare nuclei, and cytoplasmic fragments are analyzed and the resulting contextual features, slide-averaged ""features"" and high-resolution features describing single cells are combined to produce a more complete and accurate description of the smear.  This description will provide information not obtainable by human visual analysis, which can be used, 1) directly, to ascertain diagnostic clues, and 2) indirectly to make accurate prescreening possible.  An extensive pilot study has shown that the contextual analysis provides complementary information to that provided by single cell analysis.  That is, where single cell analysis seems to have difficulty, contextual analysis is most accurate - and vice versa. Thus we expect to demonstrate that the combination of our contextual analysis techniques with single cell analysis will give automated Pap smear analysis the additional screening accuracy that is needed.  The proposed project is a followup intended to:  a) validate the techniques of the pilot study, b) to expand the study to include parameters that provide additional diagnostic and prognostic information, and c) to generate specifications for a system to accomplish the analysis in a routine clinical laboratory environment.

"DISCRETE VS. CONTINUOS MODELS OF VISUAL PERCEPTION Two very different types of models of visual perception have been used by researchers in the fields of cognitive psychology and human information processing.  Discrete models characterized visual perception as a discrete operation that must completely finish processing a stimulus before any further cognitive processes receive information about that stimulus (e.g., Sternberg, 1969a). Continuous models characterize it as a continuous operation that gradually transmits information about a stimulus to later cognitive processes, so that these processes can begin before perception is finished (e.g., McClelland, 1979).  It is important for both theoretical and methodological reasons to be able to discriminate between these two types of models, and the goal of the proposed research is to develop experimental tests that can choose between them.  The proposed experiments emphasize two lines of research.  One set of experiments will use psychophysiological measurements to look for evidence that some response preparation has occurred before stimulus perception has finished.  Previous studies have sought evidence of such preliminary response preparation using indirect measures based on total response latency, and results have been subject to alternative explanations.  Using electrophysiological measures including the electromyogram (EMG) and event-related cerebral potentials (ERPs), it should be possible to measure preliminary response preparation more directly.  These measures will be obtained in several different experimental paradigms yielding effects previously attributed to preliminary response preparation, and they will indicate whether such preparation is actually responsible for these effects.  Such preliminary response preparation would be consistent with continuous, but not discrete, models of perceptual processes.  The second set of experiments will use reaction time measurements to study visual attention.  If it can be established that attentional emphasis continuously modulates the output of perceptual processes (rather than their use by late processes), then this would constitute broad support for models with continuous rather than discrete activation of stimulus codes.  The results of these studies will be of interest to cognitive psychologists, human factors engineers and designers of interfaces for human/computer interaction, and researchers in some areas of artificial intelligence.

"QUANTITATIVE REGIONAL CURVATURE ANALYSIS Artificial intelligence and machine vision systems often use shape analysis as a fundamental approach to characterization of complex objects and motion.  Such concepts have been used to advantage in industry but have not been extensively exploited for cardiac diagnosis.  Aims:  (1) To develop a method of quantitative regional function analysis based on analysis of dynamics of ventricular shape that will replace traditional methods used to assess wall motion so that assumptions regarding coordinate, reference and indexing systems, geometry of the ventricle and uniformity of its contraction pattern can be abandoned.  (2) To quantify the regional shape of the normal right and left ventricles and establish the patterns of shape abnormality seen in the setting of coronary artery disease.  (3) To establish the relationship between regional shape and regional function.  (4) To develop a clinically useable, automated method for ventricular feature extraction and determine its usefulness in predicting the presence and location of coronary disease by analysis of ventricular images obtained during an ischemic stress.  (5) To assess the prognostic significance of regional shape analysis.  (6) To automate the requisite edge detection by using integrative methods of artificial intelligence.  The hypothesis is that the normal ventricle has a characteristic shape and rate of shape change throughout the phases of the cardiac cycle and that abnormal ventricles have abnormal shapes and shape changes by virtue of abnormalities of function.  Therefore, quantitation of abnormalities of shape parameters will provide an indirect measure of ventricular dysfunction.  This will be determined by frame-by-frame curvature analysis of cineventriculograms in patients with normal and stenotic coronary arteries.  Animal studies will compare results of regional thickening and thinning determined by implanted sonomicrometers with shape changes assessed from simultaneous contrast ventriculograms and ventricular outlines determined from implanted subendocardial lead pellets.  The success of this approach will allow abandonment of numerous controversial assumptions mandated by traditional approaches and will solve a long-standing problem in cardiology.  The concepts to be explored will provide new and unique information of potential prognastic importance and it will advance the neglected field of computer vision in the study of non-rigid bodies in motion.

"FUNCTIONAL NEUROIMAGING BY MRI--HUMAN VISUAL SYSTEM In this grant we propose the continued development and application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging (or MRI) based methods for studying brain function.  These new techniques offer cognitive neuroscientists a unique opportunity to study both the functional and anatomical mechanisms underlying perception, memory, language and image generation.  The brain possesses anatomically distinct processing regions.

"AN EXPERT-TRAINED CONSULTATION SYSTEM FOR MAMMOGRAPHY The aim of this project is to develop a computer-assisted consultation system for clinical radiologists in the classification of benign and malignant (cancer) calcifications on mammograms. An automated screening of digital mammograms can be further developed when this system is fully tested in various clinical settings. The success of this project will inspire revolutionary improvements in other cancer diagnostic procedures through further research and development. We have demonstrated that the newly developed artificial visual neural networks and training methods (by presenting microcalcification patterns in the training session) can detect microcalcifications on mammograms. A similar method can be used for the detection of lung nodules on chest radiographs.  The proposed feature extraction methods and artificial visual neural networks simulate radiologists' routine practices in reading mammograms. Radiologists' viewing patterns and decision making processes will be modeled and converted to computer readable form. Preliminary studies have shown the promise of this approach. The Phase I study will address issues related to the differentiation of malignant from benign microcalcifications based on radiographs taken from breast tissue specimens.

"Diagnostic Aid Software for Visual Field Test    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual Field (VF) test is a widely used, noninvasive technique for evaluating pathology or dysfunction in the visual pathways. The VF test, in conjunction with other diagnostics, is used for detection of early stages of glaucoma and for following its progression. Early detection is critical as blindness from glaucoma is preventable in nearly all cases, provided treatment is administered early in the progression. However, the inherent subjectivity of the VF test makes it often difficult to interpret even for a skilled practitioner. There is a need for automated decision aid tool that will facilitate and standardize the interpretation task.   In Phase 1 of this project, IAC will design and implement novel software algorithms to automate the interpretation of VF test data for detection of glaucoma. The software will classify VF test data into normal, borderline glaucomatous, glaucomatous and unknown (not normal or glaucomatous). The aim is to provide classification performance close to that of a highly skilled human expert. The emphasis will be on the detection of early stages of glaucoma. In addition to the classification output, the software will produce a set of comprehensive rules that will explain the decision path leading to the suggested diagnosis.         ",Diagnostic Aid Software for Visual Field Test,6582662,R43EY014077,"['computer assisted diagnosis ', ' artificial intelligence ', ' computer system design /evaluation ', ' computer program /software ', ' diagnosis design /evaluation ', ' early diagnosis ', ' noninvasive diagnosis ', ' visual field ', ' glaucoma ', ' glaucoma test ', ' vision test ', ' human data ', ' ']",NEI,INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION CORPORATION,R43,2003,93160,0.12630500300493563

"Optimization of Folding and Threading Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Determining protein structure and function from genomic sequences and protein classification remains one of the most significant challenges in modern computational biology.  Significant enhancement to the capacity of algorithms to predict protein shapes from sequences is proposed, focusing on major bottlenecks; e.g., the folding energy and the ability of making approximate matches.  Algorithms to determine protein shapes from sequences have two major components: The first component (sampling) generates a set of plausible protein shapes; at least one of the sampled shapes is expected to be similar to the correct fold.  The second component scores the different structures and decides on the best model.  The radius of convergence of the energy function must be sufficiently large so that approximate matches will be detected as well (in threading approximate matches may include deletions and insertion).  It is therefore clear that poor scoring functions (or energies), which are unable to identify the correct fold, are likely to diminish the capacity of the folding algorithm.  At present, it is easy to generate a set of decoy (wrong) structures that will confuse existing energy functions.  Mathematical programming and machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machines) will design enhanced folding and threading potentials.  The training by these methods is automated and will lead to monotonic improvement in recognition as a function of the data size.  To more effectively cover protein space, the goal is to learn 100 million data points in a single consistent potential with (at most) 10,000 parameters.  The automated large scale learning is crucial at times in which the information on sequences and structures grows rapidly.  A threading prediction server, based on the old and the new potentials, is and will be available, to the community at http://ser-loopp.tc.cornell.edu/Ioopp.html         ",Optimization of Folding and Threading Proteins,6727166,R01GM067823,"['molecular shape ', ' chemical model ', ' protein folding ', ' protein sequence ', ' bioinformatics ', ' computational biology ', ' ']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,261122,0.08779840199931527
"Computational Modeling of Anatomical Shape Distributions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Segmentation of detailed, patient-specific models from medical imagery can provide invaluable assistance for surgical planning and navigation. Current segmentation methods often make errors when confronted with subtle intensity boundaries. Adding knowledge of expected shape of a structure, and the range of normal variations in shape, can greatly improve segmentation, by guiding it towards the most likely shape consistent with the image information. The resulting segmentations can be used to plan surgical procedures, and when registered to the patient, can provide navigational guidance around critical structures. Many neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and Fetal Growth Restriction, affect the shape of specific anatomical areas. To understand the development and progression of these diseases, as well as to develop methods for classifying instances into diseased or normal classes, 1 needs methods that capture differences in shape distributions between populations. Our goal is to develop and validate methods for learning from images concise representations of anatomical shape and its variability, Modeling shape distributions will improve segmentation algorithms by biasing the search towards more likely shapes. It will also enable quantitative analysis based on shape in population studies, where imaging is used to study differences in anatomy between populations, as well as changes within a population, for example with age. The proposed research builds on prior methods for segmentation and shape analysis, using tools from computer vision and machine learning applied to questions of shape representation, shape based segmentation and shape analysis for population studies. We plan to further develop the methods and to validate them with our collaborators in several different applications, including surgical planning, neonatal imaging and image-based studies of aging and Alzheimer's disease.

"Diagnostic aid software for the visual field test Visual field (VF) test is a widely used, noninvasive technique for evaluating pathology or dysfunction in the visual pathways. The VF test, in conjunction with other diagnostics, is used for detection of  laucoma and for following its progression. Early detection is critical as blindness from glaucoma is preventable in nearly all cases, provided treatment is administered early in the progression. There is a need for an automated decision aid tool that will facilitate and standardize the interpretation task. Following a successful Phase I feasibility demonstration, Phase II will apply novel machine learning approaches to the problem of glaucoma diagnosis via an automated analysis of visual field and ancillary data. IAC will develop an integrated, user friendly software program that will provide a reliable detailed classification of glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous defects with the main emphasis on glaucomatous defects and early detection. The aim is to achieve classification accuracy close to that of a highly skilled human expert.

"Visual & Interactive Issues in the Design of Web Surveys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid acceptance of the Worldwide Web as a vehicle for survey data collection raises important questions about how the new method works. Key features of Web surveys include the use of rich visual presentation of questions and the capability of interaction with the respondent. The rapid growth of the Web makes a close examination of these issues even more urgent. Neither set of features has been explored thoroughly even with earlier modes and the Web offers widely increased resources for both visual display (Web questionnaires can readily incorporate still pictures or video clips) and interaction (such as, floating screens and scrolling for help with definitions). Our application outlines a set of studies designed to address key questions about these issues. The studies focus on Web surveys, but we believe that the results would generalize to other modes of data collection that rely on visual presentation or incorporate interactive design features.   Experiments 1-5 examine how respondents interpret the visual cues in Web questionnaires. These studies test the general proposition that incidental features of the presentation of the questions (for example, the spacing of the response options, the color assigned to different response options) can give rise to unintended inferences about their meaning. These studies test predictions derived from a theoretical framework that assumes respondents use simple interpretive heuristics to assign meaning to visual features of the questions. The next two experiments examine the effects of including images as a supplement to the text of the question. Images are necessarily concrete, and Experiment 6 tests the hypothesis that this concreteness may lead respondents to interpret the questions more narrowly when they are accompanied by images. Experiment 7 tests the idea that the item depicted in an image may serve as a standard of comparison for respondents' judgments. Again, the results of these studies will lead to practical guidelines about the dangers involved in using images as an adjunct to verbal questions. The final series of studies examines when respondents are likely to take advantage of interactive features of a questionnaire. These experiments test three general hypotheses; respondents are more likely to utilize the information available to them interactively when 1) the information is easy to obtain, 2) it is clearly helpful, and 3) respondents are highly motivated to seek help. These six experiments would yield a better understanding of methods for getting respondents to use features that could yield better survey data.         ",Visual & Interactive Issues in the Design of Web Surveys,6879624,R01HD041386,"['artificial intelligence ', ' computer human interaction ', ' visual perception ', ' human subject ', ' questionnaire ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' mathematics ', ' population survey ', ' behavior test ', ' attitude ', ' behavior prediction ', ' cue ', ' imagery ', ' space perception ', ' interactive multimedia ', ' Internet ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2005,206550,0.19867232012417024

"Optimization of Folding and Threading Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Determining protein structure and function from genomic sequences and protein classification remains one of the most significant challenges in modern computational biology.  Significant enhancement to the capacity of algorithms to predict protein shapes from sequences is proposed, focusing on major bottlenecks; e.g., the folding energy and the ability of making approximate matches.  Algorithms to determine protein shapes from sequences have two major components: The first component (sampling) generates a set of plausible protein shapes; at least one of the sampled shapes is expected to be similar to the correct fold.  The second component scores the different structures and decides on the best model.  The radius of convergence of the energy function must be sufficiently large so that approximate matches will be detected as well (in threading approximate matches may include deletions and insertion).  It is therefore clear that poor scoring functions (or energies), which are unable to identify the correct fold, are likely to diminish the capacity of the folding algorithm.  At present, it is easy to generate a set of decoy (wrong) structures that will confuse existing energy functions.  Mathematical programming and machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machines) will design enhanced folding and threading potentials.  The training by these methods is automated and will lead to monotonic improvement in recognition as a function of the data size.

"Perceptual Organization and Attention: Behavior & fMRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual perception is selective, and visual attention is the mechanism by which salient or high-priority objects are prioritized for awareness and action. Recent work has shown that attentional selection often operates on perceptual objects and not simply on spatial locations. In a multi-object scene involving partial occlusion, image regions must be grouped into coherent object representations prior to attentional deployment. The visual system employs a set of heuristics that serve to constrain object recognition based on principles of perceptual organization. Despite their importance to human navigation and behavior, knowledge of these heuristics and the neural mechanisms that underlie this process remain poorly understood. The proposed project will examine the grouping principles that are critical to object-based attentional selection, and will enumerate the dominance relations among these principles when they are consistent with competing groupings within a scene. The project also explores the neural implementation of these processes to extend our knowledge of the constraints built into the object recognition and visual attention systems. The combination of behavioral and neuroimaging methods outlined in this application will result in a better understanding of the neural circuitry that is responsible for efficient, goal-directed object recognition.           ",Perceptual Organization and Attention: Behavior & fMRI,7112773,F31NS055664,"['artificial intelligence ', ' visual perception ', ' attention ', ' behavior ', ' cue ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2006,37861,0.15529273830074364

"Shape representation and attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the way the visual system processes complex shape. We focus on two intermediate visual areas, V2 and V4, located in the ventral processing stream immediately beyond primary visual cortex (area VI). These areas serve as the major input stages for higher-order shape processing areas in the temporal cortex. We propose neurophysiological experiments to investigate the way that shape is represented in these areas and the way that attention modulates these representations. Shape is difficult to describe and parameterize, so previous neurophysiological studies of shape processing have utilized simple, regular shapes that are experimentally convenient. However, intermediate shape processing is highly nonlinear, so results obtained with reduced stimulus sets may not generalize to other stimuli. We therefore propose to use both complex, natural stimuli and simpler stimuli such as gratings. To facilitate this, we are developing novel nonlinear regression algorithms to estimate the stimulus-response mapping functions of neurons in V2 and V4. The underlying shape dimensions represented therein can then be determined by applying visualization algorithms (developed in our laboratory) to the stimulus-response mapping functions estimated for single neurons. In another series of experiments we plan to investigate how extrastriate visual areas integrate information from earlier sensory areas. Finally, we propose to examine how visual attention affects shape representations in V2 and V4. We will accomplish this by quantifying the effects of selective attention to a specific shape (feature attention) and attention directed toward a specific location in space (spatial attention) on neuronal tuning curves. Successful completion of these projects will provide critical information to aid in development of quantitative computational models of shape processing in intermediate vision.

"Origins of Object Knowledge    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Twelve experiments investigate the early development, in human infants, of perception of the unity of partly occluded surfaces. The experiments focus on a time during ontogeny when there may be evidence of visual sensitivity to information specifying object properties, but limited ability to perceive occlusion, with the goal of observing real-time processes by which the infant assembles visible parts of a stimulus into a coherent whole. This approach stipulates that onset of sensitivity to motion and orientation information, development of the oculomotor system, and experience viewing objects undergoing occlusion and disocclusion, play a direct, foundational role in the ontogeny of object perception. That is, there is an hypothesized period, 2 to 4 months of age, during which infants come to use newly-emerged visual skills to perceive objects accurately. The experiments follow a similar strategy: explorations of individual and group differences in both basic visual processing skills and perception of the unity of partly occluded surfaces. Infant perception is assessed with two methods: (a) recording of eye movements, to measure improvements in pickup of important visual .information, and (b) habituation/dishabituation, to ascertain perception of object unity as well as to determine the extent of sensitivity to available visual information. It is expected that the detailed analysis of individual differences afforded by this approach provide the opportunity for exceptionally sensitive measures of the emergence of visual skills and object knowledge. The short-term objectives of the present proposal are to elucidate fundamental developmental mechanisms in the context of the classic nature-nurture debate. The long-term goals are to shed light on the larger question of how knowledge is acquired and structured in the human, and how perceptual skills impact knowledge acquisition and structure. In the future, such understanding may aid in the formulation of diagnostics and treatments for some developmental disorders.         ",Origins of Object Knowledge,7212153,R01HD040432,"['Corpus striatum structure ', ' striatal ', ' Striatum ', ' Striate Body ', ' Corpus Striatum ', ' developmental disease/disorder ', ' developmental disorder ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' None or Not Applicable ', ' Knowledge acquisition ', ' Age-Months ', ' Detection ', ' Range ', ' Cognitive ', ' trend ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Support of Research ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Heart ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Surface ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Infant Development ', ' Link ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Computer information processing ', ' Training ', ' Laboratories ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Learning ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Fostering ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Funding ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' tool ', ' Psychology ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Condition ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rotation ', ' Saccades ', ' Saccadic Pursuit ', ' Saccadic Eye Movements ', ' Science ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Knowledge ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Side ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' size ', ' meter ', ' Drug Formulations ', ' Formulation ', ' gaze ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Visual system structure ', ' Visual System ', ' visual processing ', ' Visual attention ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Budgets ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' abstracting ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Process Measure ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' theories ', ' oculomotor ', ' ocularmotor ', ' ocular motor ', ' Academy ', ' Cognition ', ' object perception ', ' Individual Differences ', ' sequence learning ', ' visual information ', ' visual process ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' ']",NICHD,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,272700,0.1424292380203443
"Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma: Clinical Electrophysiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to investigate the diagnostic precision for detecting glaucoma of clinical electrophysiological measurement (pattern electroretinogram, PERG; and multifocal visual evoked potentials, mfVEP), a technique identified as an important recent glaucoma- related development in eye research by the 2004 National Eye Institute (NEI) National Plan. Aim 1: Electrophysiological responses will be characterized in glaucoma, suspect and healthy eyes and the diagnostic accuracy of these commercially available techniques will be compared to current reference standards (evaluation of stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc and standard automated perimetry) and to recently developed diagnostic techniques including optical imaging of the optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, optical coherence tomography, and scanning laser polarimetry) and visual function-specific perimetry (short-wavelength automated perimetry and frequency doubling technology perimetry). Aim 2: Novel use of machine learning classifier techniques (e.g. relevance vector machines, support vector machines, mixture of Gaussian techniques, independent components analysis) will be applied to electrophysiological data to improve its diagnostic accuracy and data from different diagnostic techniques (named above) will be combined to improve overall diagnostic accuracy. Aim 3: Electrophysiological measurements will be validated as functional indicators of optic nerve damage by examining the relationship between electrophysiological abnormality and optic disc and RNFL damage in glaucoma and glaucoma suspect patients. 210 patients (105 glaucoma's, 105 glaucoma suspects) and 105 healthy participants will be enrolled and studied cross-sectionally.

"Population analysis of shape representation in V4    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The perception of shape is essential for object identification and visually guided action. The neural represenation of shape is mediated by a hierarchical system of brain areas known collectively as the ventral stream. Damage to ventral stream areas may lead to visual agnosias that can severely compromise quality of life. It is therefore important to achieve an understanding of how shape representation is generated. We will examine the neural representation of shape in V4, a brain region that is situated at an intermediate level on the ventral stream hierarchy. Our stategy will be to construct quantitative models of the relationship between neurophysiological activity and visual input at both the single cell and population levels. Our approach to constructing these models will be distinguished by the use of advanced non-linear statistical techniques, complex visual stimuli that simulates natural viewing conditions, and the use of multi-electrode arrays to record populations of neurons simultaneously. Interpretation and analysis of these models will allow us adress two specific questions: 1) what are the independent stimulus dimensions to which V4 neurons are tuned?; 2) how is the distributed activity of V4 cell populations combined to represent shape?           ",Population analysis of shape representation in V4,7232722,F32EY016941,"['Image ', ' imaging ', ' Affect ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual Agnosias ', ' Visual ', ' receptive field ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Simulate ', ' Animals ', ' Perception ', ' Shapes ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Condition ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Testing ', ' Attention ', ' Work ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' Behavior ', ' Visual system structure ', ' Visual System ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' visual stimulus ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Structure ', ' Devices ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Cells ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' response ', ' visual search ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' area V4 ', ' Population ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' visual area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' V4 neuron ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Brain region ', ' Electrodes ', ' Environment ', ' Data ', ' Population Analysis ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F32,2007,48796,0.15858059093776686
"Visual statistical learning in human infants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this program of research is to determine how the developing human infant forms representations of the visual world. The focus of the research is on a class of powerful learning mechanisms that have been shown by the Principal Investigator and his colleagues to rapidly extract from sequences of auditory stimuli the statistical properties that form coherent units (e.g., words and melodies). Visual statistical learning will be studied to determine whether a similarly powerful set of mechanisms is present in a modality other than audition. Infants ranging in age from 3- to 12-months of age, as well as adults, will be tested on a variety of statistical learning tasks in which small visual shapes are arranged into scenes. At issue is how infants and adults learn that some of these shapes appear together (co-occur) across many different scenes, forming the basic building blocks for representing those scenes in memory. Four different techniques will be used with infants. The primary technique involves the repeated presentation of a sequence of 16-28 different scenes composed of 3-6 different shapes. After a decline in looking time (habituation) to these displays, infants will be presented with test displays containing coherent (high statistical relatedness) and incoherent (unrelated) shapes that were embedded in the scenes. The other three techniques involve forced-choice preferential looking, automated corneal reflection eye-tracking, and anticipatory eye-movements to learned categories. These techniques will be used to determine whether newly learned features activate attention in cluttered scenes, how these features are learned when low-level properties of the scenes compete for attention, how variations over time in the input statistics affect the accuracy of feature learning, and how other perceptual constraints affect feature learning. A key hypothesis of the Pl's statistical approach will be tested -- that learners represent the largest coherent unit in a complex array of elements, rather than also representing all of the embedded elements that are redundant with this larger unit. Taken together, these proposed studies will reveal how infants and adults learn new information from complex visual scenes and represent that information in a computationally efficient manner. Failure to learn efficiently could lead to deficits in the early phases of learning in infancy and negatively affect the formation of higher level categories.

"Optimization of Folding and Threading Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Determining protein structure and function from genomic sequences and protein classification remains one of the most significant challenges in modern computational biology.  Significant enhancement to the capacity of algorithms to predict protein shapes from sequences is proposed, focusing on major bottlenecks; e.g., the folding energy and the ability of making approximate matches.  Algorithms to determine protein shapes from sequences have two major components: The first component (sampling) generates a set of plausible protein shapes; at least one of the sampled shapes is expected to be similar to the correct fold.  The second component scores the different structures and decides on the best model.  The radius of convergence of the energy function must be sufficiently large so that approximate matches will be detected as well (in threading approximate matches may include deletions and insertion).  It is therefore clear that poor scoring functions (or energies), which are unable to identify the correct fold, are likely to diminish the capacity of the folding algorithm.  At present, it is easy to generate a set of decoy (wrong) structures that will confuse existing energy functions.  Mathematical programming and machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machines) will design enhanced folding and threading potentials.  The training by these methods is automated and will lead to monotonic improvement in recognition as a function of the data size.  To more effectively cover protein space, the goal is to learn 100 million data points in a single consistent potential with (at most) 10,000 parameters.  The automated large scale learning is crucial at times in which the information on sequences and structures grows rapidly.

"Computational Modeling of Anatomical Shape Distributions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Segmentation of detailed, patient-specific models from medical imagery can provide invaluable assistance for surgical planning and navigation. Current segmentation methods often make errors when confronted with subtle intensity boundaries. Adding knowledge of expected shape of a structure, and the range of normal variations in shape, can greatly improve segmentation, by guiding it towards the most likely shape consistent with the image information. The resulting segmentations can be used to plan surgical procedures, and when registered to the patient, can provide navigational guidance around critical structures. Many neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and Fetal Growth Restriction, affect the shape of specific anatomical areas. To understand the development and progression of these diseases, as well as to develop methods for classifying instances into diseased or normal classes, 1 needs methods that capture differences in shape distributions between populations. Our goal is to develop and validate methods for learning from images concise representations of anatomical shape and its variability, Modeling shape distributions will improve segmentation algorithms by biasing the search towards more likely shapes. It will also enable quantitative analysis based on shape in population studies, where imaging is used to study differences in anatomy between populations, as well as changes within a population, for example with age. The proposed research builds on prior methods for segmentation and shape analysis, using tools from computer vision and machine learning applied to questions of shape representation, shape based segmentation and shape analysis for population studies. We plan to further develop the methods and to validate them with our collaborators in several different applications, including surgical planning, neonatal imaging and image-based studies of aging and Alzheimer's disease.

"Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed work is to understand how learning by the visual system helps it to represent the immediate environment during perception. Because perception is accurate, we can know spatial layout: the shapes, orientations, sizes, and spatial locations of the objects and surfaces around us. But this accuracy requires that the visual system learn over time how best to interpret visual ""cues"". These cues are the signals from the environment that the visual system extracts from the retinal images that are informative about spatial layout. Known cues include binocular disparity, texture gradients, occlusion relations, motion parallax, and familiar size, to name a few. How do these cues come to be interpreted correctly? A fundamental problem is that visual cues are ambiguous. Even if cues could be measured exactly (which they cannot, the visual system being a physical device) there would still be different possible 3D interpretations for a given set of cues. As a result, the visual system is forced to operate probabilistically: the way things ""look"" to us reflects an implicit guess as to which interpretation of the cues is most likely to be correct. Each additional cue helps improve the guess. For example, the retinal image of a door could be interpreted as a vertical rectangle or as some other quadrilateral at a non-vertical orientation in space, and the shadow cues at the bottom of the door helps the system know that it's a vertical rectangle. What mechanisms do the visual system use to discern which cues are available for interpreting images correctly? The proposed work aims to answer this fundamental question about perceptual learning. It was recently shown that the visual system can detect and start using new cues for perception. This phenomenon can be studied in the laboratory using classical conditioning procedures that were previously developed to study learning in animals. In the proposed experiments, a model system is used to understand details about when this learning occurs and what is learned. The data will be compared to predictions based on older, analogous studies in the animal learning literature, and interpreted in the context of Bayesian statistical inference, especially machine learning theory. The proposed work benefits public health by characterizing the brain mechanisms that keep visual perception accurate. These mechanisms are at work in the many months during which a person with congenital cataracts learns to use vision after the cataracts are removed, and it is presumably these mechanisms that go awry when an individual with a family history of synesthesia or autism develops anomalous experience-dependent perceptual responses. Neurodegenerative diseases may disrupt visual learning, in which case visual learning tests could be used to detect disease; understanding the learning of new cues in human vision could lead to better computerized aids for the visually impaired; and knowing what causes a new cue to be learned could lead to new technologies for training people to perceive accurately in novel work environments.          ",Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception,7388324,R01EY013988,"['Cues ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Food ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Depth ', ' Surface ', ' Training ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Funding ', ' Memory ', ' Pathology ', ' Perception ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Reversal Learning ', ' Rotation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Space Perception ', ' spatial perception ', ' spatial orientation (perception) ', ' spatial orientation ', ' perceptual spatial orientation ', ' Spatial Discrimination ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision Disparity ', ' Visual Disparity ', ' Retinal Disparity ', ' Ocular Parallax ', ' Ocular Disparity ', ' Fixation Disparity ', ' Binocular Disparity ', ' Binocular Vision ', ' Visual impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Low Vision ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Visual Perception ', ' Work ', ' Autistic Disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' size ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' visual learning ', ' Visual system structure ', ' Visual System ', ' visual processing ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Calibration ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Devices ', ' Appearance ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' Learning disability ', ' Measures ', ' Shadowing (Histology) ', ' Shadowing ', ' Cataract ', ' cataractous lenses ', ' cataractogenesis ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' devices for the visually impaired ', ' interfaces for the visually impaired ', ' Perceptual learning ', ' Retinal ', ' area MT ', ' area V5 ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' visual information ', ' visual process ', ' stereoscopic ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' congenital cataract ', ' inherited cataract ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Motion ', ' Motion Perception ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Animals ', ' ']",NEI,STATE COLLEGE OF OPTOMETRY,R01,2008,228847,0.24379293852595144

"Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma: Clinical Electrophysiology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to investigate the diagnostic precision for detecting glaucoma of clinical electrophysiological measurement (pattern electroretinogram, PERG; and multifocal visual evoked potentials, mfVEP), a technique identified as an important recent glaucoma- related development in eye research by the 2004 National Eye Institute (NEI) National Plan. Aim 1: Electrophysiological responses will be characterized in glaucoma, suspect and healthy eyes and the diagnostic accuracy of these commercially available techniques will be compared to current reference standards (evaluation of stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc and standard automated perimetry) and to recently developed diagnostic techniques including optical imaging of the optic disc and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) (confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, optical coherence tomography, and scanning laser polarimetry) and visual function-specific perimetry (short-wavelength automated perimetry and frequency doubling technology perimetry). Aim 2: Novel use of machine learning classifier techniques (e.g. relevance vector machines, support vector machines, mixture of Gaussian techniques, independent components analysis) will be applied to electrophysiological data to improve its diagnostic accuracy and data from different diagnostic techniques (named above) will be combined to improve overall diagnostic accuracy. Aim 3: Electrophysiological measurements will be validated as functional indicators of optic nerve damage by examining the relationship between electrophysiological abnormality and optic disc and RNFL damage in glaucoma and glaucoma suspect patients. 210 patients (105 glaucoma's, 105 glaucoma suspects) and 105 healthy participants will be enrolled and studied cross-sectionally.

"Population analysis of shape representation in V4    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The perception of shape is essential for object identification and visually guided action. The neural represenation of shape is mediated by a hierarchical system of brain areas known collectively as the ventral stream. Damage to ventral stream areas may lead to visual agnosias that can severely compromise quality of life. It is therefore important to achieve an understanding of how shape representation is generated. We will examine the neural representation of shape in V4, a brain region that is situated at an intermediate level on the ventral stream hierarchy. Our stategy will be to construct quantitative models of the relationship between neurophysiological activity and visual input at both the single cell and population levels. Our approach to constructing these models will be distinguished by the use of advanced non-linear statistical techniques, complex visual stimuli that simulates natural viewing conditions, and the use of multi-electrode arrays to record populations of neurons simultaneously. Interpretation and analysis of these models will allow us adress two specific questions: 1) what are the independent stimulus dimensions to which V4 neurons are tuned?; 2) how is the distributed activity of V4 cell populations combined to represent shape?           ",Population analysis of shape representation in V4,7483599,F32EY016941,"['Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Brain region ', ' Electrodes ', ' Environment ', ' Data ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Affect ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual Agnosias ', ' Visual ', ' receptive field ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Simulate ', ' Animals ', ' Perception ', ' Shapes ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Condition ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Testing ', ' Attention ', ' Work ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' Behavior ', ' Visual system structure ', ' Visual System ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' visual stimulus ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Structure ', ' Devices ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Cells ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' response ', ' visual search ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' area V4 ', ' Population ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' visual area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' V4 neuron ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F32,2008,50428,0.15858059093776686
"Shape representation and attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the way the visual system processes complex shape. We focus on two intermediate visual areas, V2 and V4, located in the ventral processing stream immediately beyond primary visual cortex (area VI). These areas serve as the major input stages for higher-order shape processing areas in the temporal cortex. We propose neurophysiological experiments to investigate the way that shape is represented in these areas and the way that attention modulates these representations. Shape is difficult to describe and parameterize, so previous neurophysiological studies of shape processing have utilized simple, regular shapes that are experimentally convenient. However, intermediate shape processing is highly nonlinear, so results obtained with reduced stimulus sets may not generalize to other stimuli. We therefore propose to use both complex, natural stimuli and simpler stimuli such as gratings. To facilitate this, we are developing novel nonlinear regression algorithms to estimate the stimulus-response mapping functions of neurons in V2 and V4. The underlying shape dimensions represented therein can then be determined by applying visualization algorithms (developed in our laboratory) to the stimulus-response mapping functions estimated for single neurons. In another series of experiments we plan to investigate how extrastriate visual areas integrate information from earlier sensory areas. Finally, we propose to examine how visual attention affects shape representations in V2 and V4. We will accomplish this by quantifying the effects of selective attention to a specific shape (feature attention) and attention directed toward a specific location in space (spatial attention) on neuronal tuning curves. Successful completion of these projects will provide critical information to aid in development of quantitative computational models of shape processing in intermediate vision.

"Origins of Object Knowledge    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Twelve experiments investigate the early development, in human infants, of perception of the unity of partly occluded surfaces. The experiments focus on a time during ontogeny when there may be evidence of visual sensitivity to information specifying object properties, but limited ability to perceive occlusion, with the goal of observing real-time processes by which the infant assembles visible parts of a stimulus into a coherent whole. This approach stipulates that onset of sensitivity to motion and orientation information, development of the oculomotor system, and experience viewing objects undergoing occlusion and disocclusion, play a direct, foundational role in the ontogeny of object perception. That is, there is an hypothesized period, 2 to 4 months of age, during which infants come to use newly-emerged visual skills to perceive objects accurately. The experiments follow a similar strategy: explorations of individual and group differences in both basic visual processing skills and perception of the unity of partly occluded surfaces. Infant perception is assessed with two methods: (a) recording of eye movements, to measure improvements in pickup of important visual .information, and (b) habituation/dishabituation, to ascertain perception of object unity as well as to determine the extent of sensitivity to available visual information. It is expected that the detailed analysis of individual differences afforded by this approach provide the opportunity for exceptionally sensitive measures of the emergence of visual skills and object knowledge. The short-term objectives of the present proposal are to elucidate fundamental developmental mechanisms in the context of the classic nature-nurture debate. The long-term goals are to shed light on the larger question of how knowledge is acquired and structured in the human, and how perceptual skills impact knowledge acquisition and structure.

"Towards cortical visual prosthetics    Description (provided by applicant): Visual object recognition is crucial for most everyday tasks including face identification, reading and navigation. In spite of the massive increase in computational power over the last two decades, a 3-year-old still outperforms the most sophisticated algorithms even in simple recognition tasks. Understanding the computations performed by the human visual system to recognize objects will have profound implications not only to understand the functions (and malfunction) of the cerebral cortex but also for developing visual prosthetic devices for the visually impaired. We combine neurophysiology, electrical stimulation and tools from machine learning to further our understanding of the neuronal circuits, algorithms and computations performed by the human visual system to perform visual pattern recognition. In the vast majority of visually impaired or blind people, the problems originate at the level of the retina while the visual cortex remains unimpaired. Our proposal constitutes a proof- of-principle approach towards developing visual prosthetic devices that rely on electrical stimulation of visual cortex. The specific aims of this proposal are designed to test the possibility of decoding and recoding information in visual cortex: (1) Read-out of visual information from human visual cortex on line (2) Write-in of visual information in human visual cortex. We take advantage of a rare opportunity to study the human brain at high spatial and temporal resolution by studying patients who have electrodes implanted for clinical reasons. Our electrophysiological recordings provide us with a unique view of the human temporal lobe circuitry and allow us to test the feasibility of cortical visual prosthetics in behaving human subjects.

"Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed work is to understand how learning by the visual system helps it to represent the immediate environment during perception. Because perception is accurate, we can know spatial layout: the shapes, orientations, sizes, and spatial locations of the objects and surfaces around us. But this accuracy requires that the visual system learn over time how best to interpret visual ""cues"". These cues are the signals from the environment that the visual system extracts from the retinal images that are informative about spatial layout. Known cues include binocular disparity, texture gradients, occlusion relations, motion parallax, and familiar size, to name a few. How do these cues come to be interpreted correctly? A fundamental problem is that visual cues are ambiguous. Even if cues could be measured exactly (which they cannot, the visual system being a physical device) there would still be different possible 3D interpretations for a given set of cues. As a result, the visual system is forced to operate probabilistically: the way things ""look"" to us reflects an implicit guess as to which interpretation of the cues is most likely to be correct. Each additional cue helps improve the guess. For example, the retinal image of a door could be interpreted as a vertical rectangle or as some other quadrilateral at a non-vertical orientation in space, and the shadow cues at the bottom of the door helps the system know that it's a vertical rectangle. What mechanisms do the visual system use to discern which cues are available for interpreting images correctly? The proposed work aims to answer this fundamental question about perceptual learning. It was recently shown that the visual system can detect and start using new cues for perception. This phenomenon can be studied in the laboratory using classical conditioning procedures that were previously developed to study learning in animals. In the proposed experiments, a model system is used to understand details about when this learning occurs and what is learned. The data will be compared to predictions based on older, analogous studies in the animal learning literature, and interpreted in the context of Bayesian statistical inference, especially machine learning theory. The proposed work benefits public health by characterizing the brain mechanisms that keep visual perception accurate. These mechanisms are at work in the many months during which a person with congenital cataracts learns to use vision after the cataracts are removed, and it is presumably these mechanisms that go awry when an individual with a family history of synesthesia or autism develops anomalous experience-dependent perceptual responses. Neurodegenerative diseases may disrupt visual learning, in which case visual learning tests could be used to detect disease; understanding the learning of new cues in human vision could lead to better computerized aids for the visually impaired; and knowing what causes a new cue to be learned could lead to new technologies for training people to perceive accurately in novel work environments.          ",Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception,7692268,R01EY013988,"['Cues ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Food ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Surface ', ' Training ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Funding ', ' Memory ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Motion ', ' Motion Perception ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Animals ', ' Pathology ', ' Perception ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Reversal Learning ', ' Rotation ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Space Perception ', ' spatial perception ', ' spatial orientation (perception) ', ' spatial orientation ', ' perceptual spatial orientation ', ' Spatial Discrimination ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision Disparity ', ' Visual Disparity ', ' Retinal Disparity ', ' Ocular Parallax ', ' Ocular Disparity ', ' Fixation Disparity ', ' Binocular Disparity ', ' Binocular Vision ', ' Visual impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Low Vision ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Visual Perception ', ' Work ', ' Autistic Disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Source ', ' Texture ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' meetings ', ' visual learning ', ' Visual system structure ', ' Visual System ', ' visual processing ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Calibration ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Devices ', ' Appearance ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' Learning disability ', ' Measures ', ' Shadowing (Histology) ', ' Shadowing ', ' Cataract ', ' cataractous lenses ', ' cataractogenesis ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' devices for the visually impaired ', ' interfaces for the visually impaired ', ' Perceptual learning ', ' Retinal ', ' area MT ', ' area V5 ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' visual information ', ' visual process ', ' stereoscopic ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' congenital cataract ', ' inherited cataract ', ' ']",NEI,STATE COLLEGE OF OPTOMETRY,R01,2009,228847,0.24379293852595144

"Towards cortical visual prosthetics    Description (provided by applicant): Visual object recognition is crucial for most everyday tasks including face identification, reading and navigation. In spite of the massive increase in computational power over the last two decades, a 3-year-old still outperforms the most sophisticated algorithms even in simple recognition tasks. Understanding the computations performed by the human visual system to recognize objects will have profound implications not only to understand the functions (and malfunction) of the cerebral cortex but also for developing visual prosthetic devices for the visually impaired. We combine neurophysiology, electrical stimulation and tools from machine learning to further our understanding of the neuronal circuits, algorithms and computations performed by the human visual system to perform visual pattern recognition. In the vast majority of visually impaired or blind people, the problems originate at the level of the retina while the visual cortex remains unimpaired. Our proposal constitutes a proof- of-principle approach towards developing visual prosthetic devices that rely on electrical stimulation of visual cortex. The specific aims of this proposal are designed to test the possibility of decoding and recoding information in visual cortex: (1) Read-out of visual information from human visual cortex on line (2) Write-in of visual information in human visual cortex. We take advantage of a rare opportunity to study the human brain at high spatial and temporal resolution by studying patients who have electrodes implanted for clinical reasons. Our electrophysiological recordings provide us with a unique view of the human temporal lobe circuitry and allow us to test the feasibility of cortical visual prosthetics in behaving human subjects.

"Origins of Object Knowledge    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Twelve experiments investigate the early development, in human infants, of perception of the unity of partly occluded surfaces. The experiments focus on a time during ontogeny when there may be evidence of visual sensitivity to information specifying object properties, but limited ability to perceive occlusion, with the goal of observing real-time processes by which the infant assembles visible parts of a stimulus into a coherent whole. This approach stipulates that onset of sensitivity to motion and orientation information, development of the oculomotor system, and experience viewing objects undergoing occlusion and disocclusion, play a direct, foundational role in the ontogeny of object perception. That is, there is an hypothesized period, 2 to 4 months of age, during which infants come to use newly-emerged visual skills to perceive objects accurately.   The experiments follow a similar strategy: explorations of individual and group differences in both basic visual processing skills and perception of the unity of partly occluded surfaces. Infant perception is assessed with two methods: (a) recording of eye movements, to measure improvements in pickup of important visual .information, and (b) habituation/dishabituation, to ascertain perception of object unity as well as to determine the extent of sensitivity to available visual information. It is expected that the detailed analysis of individual differences afforded by this approach provide the opportunity for exceptionally sensitive measures of the emergence of visual skills and object knowledge.   The short-term objectives of the present proposal are to elucidate fundamental developmental mechanisms in the context of the classic nature-nurture debate. The long-term goals are to shed light on the larger question of how knowledge is acquired and structured in the human, and how perceptual skills impact knowledge acquisition and structure.

"Perceptual Learning: Human vs. Optimal Bayesian    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neural plasticity and perceptual learning are fundamental in the developmental stages of vision, in attaining expertise in specialized perceptual tasks, and in recovery from brain injuries and low- vision disorders. One important process in perceptual learning is the improvement in humans' ability to use task-relevant (signal) information. Although there have been advances in the understanding of the dynamics and algorithms mediating how humans optimize the selection of task relevant visual information, little is known about how eye movement patterns vary with practice and their impact in optimizing perceptual performance. Yet, in real world environments, eye movements are a critical component of active vision as humans explore the visual scene to make perceptual judgments. Understanding perceptual learning in human daily life requires studying the mechanisms mediating the changes in the planning of eye movements with learning and their contributions to optimizing perceptual performance. We hypothesize that two new experimental paradigms with digitally designed visual stimuli, in conjunction with eye position recording, and a newly developed foveated ideal observer and Bayesian learner will help elucidate how humans learn to strategize their eye movements and the contributions of the optimized sampling of the images to improvements in perceptual learning. The proposed work will address the following questions: 1) Do humans use learned information about the statistical properties of the visual stimuli and the requirements of the task at hand to strategize their eye movements to optimize the foveal sampling of the visual scene and perceptual performance?; 2) Do humans use knowledge of the varying resolution of their foveated visual system to optimally learn to plan eye movements for a given set of visual stimuli and task?; 3) What are the contributions of learning to strategize eye movements to the overall improvements in perceptual performance in ecologically important tasks such as face recognition, object identification and visual search?; 4) How do human fixation patterns and performance benefits from strategizing eye movements compare to an optimal foveated observer and learner? The proposed work will improve our understanding of the human neural algorithms mediating the dynamics of adult perceptual learning during active vision for ecologically important tasks. The proposed experimental protocols and theoretical developments will also provide a novel, powerful and flexible framework with which other researchers can study eye movements and learning of humans undergoing visual loss recovery as well as patients with learning disabilities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work benefits public health by increasing our understanding of how humans learn to move their eyes to potentially informative regions of the visual scene in important daily tasks such as identifying faces or searching for objects. Thorough understanding of these mechanisms in normal humans will allow identification of learning anomalies in patients recovering from visual-loss or learning disabilities and potentially develop tests to assess treatments.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The proposed work benefits public health by increasing our understanding of how  humans learn to move their eyes to potentially informative regions of the visual scene in  important daily tasks such as identifying faces or searching for objects.

"The gist of the space: A space centered approach to visual scene perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vision is central to our interactions with the world. Aside from recognizing faces and communicating with people, our daily activities are also organized around two fundamental tasks: recognizing our environment and navigating through it. The research program of Dr. Aude Oliva constitutes a new integration of behavioral, computational and cognitive neuroscience research on scene perception. A growing body of evidence from behavioral, imaging and computational investigations has shown that the perception of complex real-world scenes engages distinct cognitive and neural mechanisms from those engaged in object recognition. To date, however, this evidence has not resulted in a comprehensive framework for understanding scene processing.  Here, the PI proposes to test the novel hypothesis that real-world scene analysis is performed in a network of distinctive brain regions, with each region specialized in representing a different level of scene information. Since scenes are inherently three-dimensional spaces, she will show that the brain capitalizes on information uniquely derived from the space encompassed by a scene, rather than an exclusively object-based description.

"Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of the proposed work is to understand how learning by the visual system helps it to represent the immediate environment during perception. Because perception is accurate, we can know spatial layout: the shapes, orientations, sizes, and spatial locations of the objects and surfaces around us. But this accuracy requires that the visual system learn over time how best to interpret visual ""cues"". These cues are the signals from the environment that the visual system extracts from the retinal images that are informative about spatial layout. Known cues include binocular disparity, texture gradients, occlusion relations, motion parallax, and familiar size, to name a few. How do these cues come to be interpreted correctly? A fundamental problem is that visual cues are ambiguous. Even if cues could be measured exactly (which they cannot, the visual system being a physical device) there would still be different possible 3D interpretations for a given set of cues. As a result, the visual system is forced to operate probabilistically: the way things ""look"" to us reflects an implicit guess as to which interpretation of the cues is most likely to be correct. Each additional cue helps improve the guess. For example, the retinal image of a door could be interpreted as a vertical rectangle or as some other quadrilateral at a non-vertical orientation in space, and the shadow cues at the bottom of the door helps the system know that it's a vertical rectangle. What mechanisms do the visual system use to discern which cues are available for interpreting images correctly? The proposed work aims to answer this fundamental question about perceptual learning. It was recently shown that the visual system can detect and start using new cues for perception. This phenomenon can be studied in the laboratory using classical conditioning procedures that were previously developed to study learning in animals. In the proposed experiments, a model system is used to understand details about when this learning occurs and what is learned. The data will be compared to predictions based on older, analogous studies in the animal learning literature, and interpreted in the context of Bayesian statistical inference, especially machine learning theory. The proposed work benefits public health by characterizing the brain mechanisms that keep visual perception accurate. These mechanisms are at work in the many months during which a person with congenital cataracts learns to use vision after the cataracts are removed, and it is presumably these mechanisms that go awry when an individual with a family history of synesthesia or autism develops anomalous experience-dependent perceptual responses. Neurodegenerative diseases may disrupt visual learning, in which case visual learning tests could be used to detect disease; understanding the learning of new cues in human vision could lead to better computerized aids for the visually impaired; and knowing what causes a new cue to be learned could lead to new technologies for training people to perceive accurately in novel work environments.          ",Cue Reliability and Depth Calibration During Space Perception,8139754,R01EY013988,"['congenital cataract ', ' inherited cataract ', ' visual learning ', ' Visual system structure ', ' Visual System ', ' visual information ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Trust ', ' visual processing ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Shadowing (Histology) ', ' Shadowing ', ' Rotation ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Cataract ', ' cataractous lenses ', ' cataractogenesis ', ' Memory ', ' Measures ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Motion ', ' Cues ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' experience ', ' Stimulus ', ' Source ', ' Literature ', ' Procedures ', ' Time ', ' Training ', ' Process ', ' Shapes ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Research ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Persons ', ' Testing ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' base ', ' novel ', ' Food ', ' improved ', ' programs ', ' Names ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Goals ', ' Perception ', ' Data ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' visual process ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' computerized ', ' Calibration ', ' Appearance ', ' Visual impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Low Vision ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Retinal ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Autistic Disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' devices for the visually impaired ', ' interfaces for the visually impaired ', ' Motion Perception ', ' Animals ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Devices ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Learning ', ' theories ', ' Surface ', ' Visual ', ' response ', ' Knowledge ', ' Funding ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Address ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Pathology ', ' meetings ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Location ', ' Laboratories ', ' Environment ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Reversal Learning ', ' Texture ', ' Vision Disparity ', ' Visual Disparity ', ' Retinal Disparity ', ' Ocular Parallax ', ' Ocular Disparity ', ' Fixation Disparity ', ' Binocular Disparity ', ' Binocular Vision ', ' Space Perception ', ' spatial perception ', ' spatial orientation (perception) ', ' spatial orientation ', ' perceptual spatial orientation ', ' Spatial Discrimination ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Perceptual learning ', ' area MT ', ' area V5 ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' stereoscopic ', ' Visual Perception ', ' classical conditioning ', ' Pavlovian conditioning ', ' Associative Learning ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' Learning disability ', ' ']",NEI,STATE COLLEGE OF OPTOMETRY,R01,2011,219694,0.24379293852595144
"Perceptual Learning: Human vs. Optimal Bayesian    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neural plasticity and perceptual learning are fundamental in the developmental stages of vision, in attaining expertise in specialized perceptual tasks, and in recovery from brain injuries and low- vision disorders. One important process in perceptual learning is the improvement in humans' ability to use task-relevant (signal) information. Although there have been advances in the understanding of the dynamics and algorithms mediating how humans optimize the selection of task relevant visual information, little is known about how eye movement patterns vary with practice and their impact in optimizing perceptual performance. Yet, in real world environments, eye movements are a critical component of active vision as humans explore the visual scene to make perceptual judgments. Understanding perceptual learning in human daily life requires studying the mechanisms mediating the changes in the planning of eye movements with learning and their contributions to optimizing perceptual performance. We hypothesize that two new experimental paradigms with digitally designed visual stimuli, in conjunction with eye position recording, and a newly developed foveated ideal observer and Bayesian learner will help elucidate how humans learn to strategize their eye movements and the contributions of the optimized sampling of the images to improvements in perceptual learning. The proposed work will address the following questions: 1) Do humans use learned information about the statistical properties of the visual stimuli and the requirements of the task at hand to strategize their eye movements to optimize the foveal sampling of the visual scene and perceptual performance?; 2) Do humans use knowledge of the varying resolution of their foveated visual system to optimally learn to plan eye movements for a given set of visual stimuli and task?; 3) What are the contributions of learning to strategize eye movements to the overall improvements in perceptual performance in ecologically important tasks such as face recognition, object identification and visual search?; 4) How do human fixation patterns and performance benefits from strategizing eye movements compare to an optimal foveated observer and learner? The proposed work will improve our understanding of the human neural algorithms mediating the dynamics of adult perceptual learning during active vision for ecologically important tasks. The proposed experimental protocols and theoretical developments will also provide a novel, powerful and flexible framework with which other researchers can study eye movements and learning of humans undergoing visual loss recovery as well as patients with learning disabilities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work benefits public health by increasing our understanding of how humans learn to move their eyes to potentially informative regions of the visual scene in important daily tasks such as identifying faces or searching for objects. Thorough understanding of these mechanisms in normal humans will allow identification of learning anomalies in patients recovering from visual-loss or learning disabilities and potentially develop tests to assess treatments.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The proposed work benefits public health by increasing our understanding of how  humans learn to move their eyes to potentially informative regions of the visual scene in  important daily tasks such as identifying faces or searching for objects.

"Neural and Behavioral Interactions Between Attention, Perception, and Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this research is to characterize how perception and memory interact, in terms of both the learning mechanisms that help transform visual experience into memory, and the intentional mechanisms that regulate this transformation. The specific goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that incidental learning about statistical regularities in vision (visual statistical learning) is limited to selectively attend visual information, and that this behavioral interaction arises because of how selective attention modulates neural interactions between human visual and memory systems. We propose a two-stage framework in which selective attention to a high-level visual feature/category increases neural interactions between regions of occipital cortex that represent low-level features and the region of inferior temporal cortex (IT) that represents the attended feature/category, and in turn between this IT region and medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub regions involved in visual learning and memory. In addition to assessing how feature-based selective attention influences learning at a behavioral level, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how attention influences evoked neural responses in task-relevant brain regions, as well as neural interactions between these regions in the background of ongoing tasks. We will develop an innovative approach for studying neural interactions in which evoked responses and global noise sources are scrubbed from the data and regional correlations are assessed in the residuals. This background connectivity approach provides a new way to study how intentional goals affect perception and learning. Aim 1 examines the first stage of our framework, testing: how selective attention modulates background connectivity between IT and occipital cortex, where in retinotopic visual cortex this modulation occurs, and how these changes are controlled by frontal and parietal cortex. Aim 2 examines the second stage of our framework, first establishing the role of the MTL in visual statistical learning, and then testing: how selective attention modulates interactions between IT and the MTL, where in cortical and hippocampal sub regions of the MTL this modulation occurs, and how these changes facilitate incidental learning about statistical regularities and later retrieval of this knowledge. In sum, we relate behavioral interactions between selective attention and learning to neural interactions between the mechanisms that represent visual features and those that learn about their relations. This proposal addresses several key issues in the field, including: how attention modulates the MTL, how feature-based attention is controlled, whether different neural mechanisms support rapid versus long-term visual learning, how tasks and goals are represented, and how attention and memory retrieval are related. This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning.

"CRCNS: Neural Reprensentation of Hierarchical Visual Concepts in Natural Scenes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complexity of natural images is potentially enormous: the number of possible images that can be described by a smallish (100 by 100 pixels) picture is practically infinite (10000256), more than all the images the human race has ever witnessed during its entire existence. How can any system process input data of this magnitude of dimensions and interpret/understand it in terms of the estimated 200,000 objects in the world, their spatial layouts, and scene structures? Yet, this is a task that human visual systems routinely perform in a fraction of a second. The secret must lie in the fact that natural images are highly redundant, living in a restricted space inside this universe of almost infinite possibilities, and that mammalian visual systems have discovered and exploited this fact. In particular, we conjecture that neurons and populations are tuned to the statistical structure of natural images, building on previous work showing, for example, that sparse coding ideas can help predict receptive field properties of 'simple cells' in the visual cortex. This proposal has three stages. Firstly, we will perform a statistical analysis of natural images to classify and model the types of visual patches that appear. This will result in a stimulus dictionary, which will be used as stimuli to investigate the tuning properties of neurons and neuronal populations, and a visual concept dictionary which will be used to make predictions for the tuning properties. Secondly, we will perform multielectrode neurophysiological investigation of the tuning properties of neurons, and neuron populations, at different levels of the visual cortex in response to the stimulus dictionary. Thirdly, we will perform data analysis to model the tuning properties of neurons and populations using a combination of model-driven, which assumes that neurons are tuned to statistical properties of images, and data-driven approaches which can be thought of as learning 'neural visual concepts' directly from the neuron's response to the stimuli. Our theoretical approach - for learning the stimuli dictionary, the visual concepts, and performing data analysis - is based on statistical and machine learning techniques. These assume a hierarchical compositional structure for the data which offers the possibility of taming the complexity of natural images and is also consistent with the known hierarchical structure of the visual cortex. Intellectual merit: This research will help understand the structure of natural images, determine models for the tuning properties of neurons in the visual cortex, and develop novel data analysis techniques. It has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the statistical structures of natural images and the neural encoding of these structures, including the population level. This will lead to greater understanding of the visual cortex and also help the development of computer vision systems. Broader impacts: This project is interdisciplinary in nature and should have broad impact in multiple disciplines: neuroscience and biological vision, statistical neural data analysis, computer vision, and machine learning. Understanding neuronal properties in the visual cortex is a pre-requisite to the clinical enterprise of developing therapeutic methods and prosthetic devices for the visually impaired. The proposed research program will help facilitate a new graduate program in Computational and Cognitive Neuroscience at UCLA, an inter-college undergraduate minor in Neural Computation at CMU that the investigators are developing at their respective universities. The investigators also plan to organize workshops in NIPS, COSYNE, as well as to integrate their research into both undergraduate and graduate curriculum in their respective universities. This work will also affect undergraduate students at other colleges, by a summer undergraduate training program in Pittsburgh, another at CMU's Qatar campus. In addition, we will propose a workshop and summer school at IPAM (UCLA). We anticipate that this research will lead to invited lectures, peer reviewed publications and, if successful, will have national and international impact. The PIs have good track record in involving undergraduates, including women and minorities, in their NSF-sponsored research, and will continue to endeavor in the training of the next generation of computational neuroscientists. This project will lead to greater understanding of neural mechanisms and coding strategies in the primate  visual cortex.

"Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now recognized that many visual diseases are influenced by complex interactions between multiple different genetic variants. As a result, our ability to predict susceptibility to visual diseases will depend critically on the computational, mathematical and statistical modeling methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic data. We propose here a bioinformatics research project to develop network modeling approaches for identifying combinations of genetic biomarkers associated with visual disease endpoints. Our working hypothesis is that a systems-based bioinformatics approach using network modeling will play a very important role in confronting the complexity of the relationship between genomic variation and visual diseases. We will first develop and evaluate modeling methods to infer large-scale genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association studies (AIM 1). We will then apply the modeling methods developed in AIM 1 to the inference of genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association data in subjects with and without visual diseases (AIM 2). Next, we will utilize the inferred genetic interaction networks to guide the development of predictive genetic models of visual diseases (AIM 3). Finally, all network modeling methods will be released to the vision research community as part of a popular user-friendly, freely available and open-source software package (AIM 4).

The primary goals involve the use of mathematically rigorous techniques to discover patterns of defects and to track their changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from up to 1800 glaucomatous and healthy eyes, available as the result of long-term NIH funding. With the interdisciplinary team of glaucoma and pattern recognition experts we have assembled, with our extensive NIH-supported database of eyes, and with the knowledge we have acquired in the optimal use of pattern recognition methods from previous NIH support, we believe the proposed work can enhance significantly the medical and surgical treatment of glaucoma and reduce the cost of glaucoma care. Moreover, improved techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can be used for refined subject recruitment and to define endpoints for clinical trials of intraocular pressure-lowering and neuroprotective drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments. This proposal addresses the current NEI Glaucoma and Optic Neuropathies Program objectives of developing improved diagnostic measures to characterize and detect optic nerve disease onset and characterize glaucomatous neurodegeneration within the visual pathways at structural and functional levels. The development/use of novel, empirical techniques for predicting and detecting glaucomatous progression can have a significant impact on the future of clinical care and the future of clinical trials designed to investigate IOP lowering and neuroprotective drugs.              The proposed project will develop and demonstrate the usefulness of pattern recognition techniques for predicting and detecting patterns of glaucomatous change in patient eyes tested longitudinally by visual field and optical imaging instruments.

"Constraints on Visual Statistical Learning in Infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual statistical learning is the process of identifying patterns of probabilistic co-occurrence among visual features, essential to our ability to perceivethe world as predictable and stable. The proposed experiments will provide the first comprehensive examination of infants' detection of complex statistical patterns in visual sequences and layouts b describing computation of probabilistic information by infants from 2 to 14 months. This is a formaive time in perceptual and cognitive development characterized by rapid developmental change in perception and learning of environmental structure. In particular, the experiments will examine how structural variability, cognitive load, and memory limitations affect learning, how contextual cues facilitate or impede this learning, and whether the products of such learning can be generalized toa different setting. In addition, the experiments will provide critical tests of domain-specificity b examining the specific contributions of spatial information to visual statistical learning. The shot-term objectives of the proposed research are to learn how developing perceptual and cognitive skills intract in early development to identify statistically defined patterns. The long-term goals are to clarifytheories of cognitive development that posit a central role for inductive learning by computing probabilitie of observations.

"CRCNS: Neural Reprensentation of Hierarchical Visual Concepts in Natural Scenes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complexity of natural images is potentially enormous: the number of possible images that can be described by a smallish (100 by 100 pixels) picture is practically infinite (10000256), more than all the images the human race has ever witnessed during its entire existence. How can any system process input data of this magnitude of dimensions and interpret/understand it in terms of the estimated 200,000 objects in the world, their spatial layouts, and scene structures? Yet, this is a task that human visual systems routinely perform in a fraction of a second. The secret must lie in the fact that natural images are highly redundant, living in a restricted space inside this universe of almost infinite possibilities, and that mammalian visual systems have discovered and exploited this fact. In particular, we conjecture that neurons and populations are tuned to the statistical structure of natural images, building on previous work showing, for example, that sparse coding ideas can help predict receptive field properties of 'simple cells' in the visual cortex. This proposal has three stages. Firstly, we will perform a statistical analysis of natural images to classify and model the types of visual patches that appear. This will result in a stimulus dictionary, which will be used as stimuli to investigate the tuning properties of neurons and neuronal populations, and a visual concept dictionary which will be used to make predictions for the tuning properties. Secondly, we will perform multielectrode neurophysiological investigation of the tuning properties of neurons, and neuron populations, at different levels of the visual cortex in response to the stimulus dictionary. Thirdly, we will perform data analysis to model the tuning properties of neurons and populations using a combination of model-driven, which assumes that neurons are tuned to statistical properties of images, and data-driven approaches which can be thought of as learning 'neural visual concepts' directly from the neuron's response to the stimuli. Our theoretical approach - for learning the stimuli dictionary, the visual concepts, and performing data analysis - is based on statistical and machine learning techniques. These assume a hierarchical compositional structure for the data which offers the possibility of taming the complexity of natural images and is also consistent with the known hierarchical structure of the visual cortex.

"Neural and Behavioral Interactions Between Attention, Perception, and Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this research is to characterize how perception and memory interact, in terms of both the learning mechanisms that help transform visual experience into memory, and the intentional mechanisms that regulate this transformation. The specific goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that incidental learning about statistical regularities in vision (visual statistical learning) is limited to selectively attend visual information, and that this behavioral interaction arises because of how selective attention modulates neural interactions between human visual and memory systems. We propose a two-stage framework in which selective attention to a high-level visual feature/category increases neural interactions between regions of occipital cortex that represent low-level features and the region of inferior temporal cortex (IT) that represents the attended feature/category, and in turn between this IT region and medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub regions involved in visual learning and memory. In addition to assessing how feature-based selective attention influences learning at a behavioral level, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how attention influences evoked neural responses in task-relevant brain regions, as well as neural interactions between these regions in the background of ongoing tasks. We will develop an innovative approach for studying neural interactions in which evoked responses and global noise sources are scrubbed from the data and regional correlations are assessed in the residuals. This background connectivity approach provides a new way to study how intentional goals affect perception and learning. Aim 1 examines the first stage of our framework, testing: how selective attention modulates background connectivity between IT and occipital cortex, where in retinotopic visual cortex this modulation occurs, and how these changes are controlled by frontal and parietal cortex. Aim 2 examines the second stage of our framework, first establishing the role of the MTL in visual statistical learning, and then testing: how selective attention modulates interactions between IT and the MTL, where in cortical and hippocampal sub regions of the MTL this modulation occurs, and how these changes facilitate incidental learning about statistical regularities and later retrieval of this knowledge. In sum, we relate behavioral interactions between selective attention and learning to neural interactions between the mechanisms that represent visual features and those that learn about their relations. This proposal addresses several key issues in the field, including: how attention modulates the MTL, how feature-based attention is controlled, whether different neural mechanisms support rapid versus long-term visual learning, how tasks and goals are represented, and how attention and memory retrieval are related. This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery and rehabilitation of visual function following eye disease, injury, or brain damage.        This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning.

"The gist of the space: A space centered approach to visual scene perception  Project Summary  Vision is central to our interactions with the world. Aside from recognizing faces and communicating with people, our daily activities are also organized around two fundamental tasks: recognizing our environment and navigating through it. The research program of Dr. Aude Oliva constitutes a new integration of behavioral, computational and cognitive neuroscience research on scene perception. A growing body of evidence from behavioral, imaging and computational investigations has shown that the perception of complex real-world scenes engages distinct cognitive and neural mechanisms from those engaged in object recognition. To date, however, this evidence has not resulted in a comprehensive framework for understanding scene processing.  Here, the PI proposes to test the novel hypothesis that real-world scene analysis is performed in a network of distinctive brain regions, with each region specialized in representing a different level of scene information. Since scenes are inherently three-dimensional spaces, she will show that the brain capitalizes on information uniquely derived from the space encompassed by a scene, rather than an exclusively object-based description. In other words, before knowing the ""gist of a scene,"" we analyze the ""gist of the space.""  Understanding the nature of the brain's representations of visual scenes is an enterprise that will push the development of fast and reliable rehabilitation strategies for individuals with visual and spatial impairments, and push forward the development of aid-based systems that rely on an understanding of the visual space. Real-world scene recognition is an unsolved mystery that will have implications for neuroscience, computational vision, artificial intelligence, robotics and psychology.  Narrative The research program constitutes a new integration of computational and cognitive neuroscience research on scene and space perception, with the aim of unraveling how the understanding of visual environments (where we are, where to navigate) arises in the human brain.",The gist of the space: A space centered approach to visual scene perception,8206519,R01EY020484,"['Affect ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Computers ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Perception ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Robotics ', ' Semantics ', ' spatial perception ', ' spatial orientation (perception) ', ' spatial orientation ', ' perceptual spatial orientation ', ' Spatial Discrimination ', ' Space Perception ', ' Testing ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' eye field ', ' Visual Fields ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' Area ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' visual processing ', ' object recognition ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' Cognitive ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' visual spatial ', ' Visuospatial ', ' Impairment ', ' rehab strategy ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' visual process ', ' ']",NEI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2012,409600,0.1899976158989154
"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention.

"Perceptual Learning: Human vs. Optimal Bayesian Neural plasticity and perceptual learning are fundamental in the developmental stages of vision,  in attaining expertise in specialized perceptual tasks, and in recovery from brain injuries and low-  vision disorders. One important process in perceptual learning is the improvement in humans'  ability to use task-relevant (signal) information. Although there have been advances in the  understanding of the dynamics and algorithms mediating how humans optimize the selection of  task relevant visual information, little is known about how eye movement patterns vary with  practice and their impact in optimizing perceptual performance. Yet, in real world environments,  eye movements are a critical component of active vision as humans explore the visual scene to  make perceptual judgments. Understanding perceptual learning in human daily life requires  studying the mechanisms mediating the changes in the planning of eye movements with learning  and their contributions to optimizing perceptual performance. We hypothesize that two new  experimental paradigms with digitally designed visual stimuli, in conjunction with eye position  recording, and a newly developed foveated ideal observer and Bayesian learner will help  elucidate how humans learn to strategize their eye movements and the contributions of the  optimized sampling of the images to improvements in perceptual learning. The proposed work  will address the following questions: 1) Do humans use learned information about the statistical  properties of the visual stimuli and the requirements of the task at hand to strategize their eye  movements to optimize the foveal sampling of the visual scene and perceptual performance?; 2)  Do humans use knowledge of the varying resolution of their foveated visual system to optimally  learn to plan eye movements for a given set of visual stimuli and task?; 3) What are the  contributions of learning to strategize eye movements to the overall improvements in perceptual  performance in ecologically important tasks such as face recognition, object identification and  visual search?; 4) How do human fixation patterns and performance benefits from strategizing  eye movements compare to an optimal foveated observer and learner? The proposed work will  improve our understanding of the human neural algorithms mediating the dynamics of adult  perceptual learning during active vision for ecologically important tasks. The proposed  experimental protocols and theoretical developments will also provide a novel, powerful and  flexible framework with which other researchers can study eye movements and learning of  humans undergoing visual loss recovery as well as patients with learning disabilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The proposed work benefits public health by increasing our understanding of how  humans learn to move their eyes to potentially informative regions of the visual scene in  important daily tasks such as identifying faces or searching for objects. Thorough  understanding of these mechanisms in normal humans will allow identification of  learning anomalies in patients recovering from visual-loss or learning disabilities and  potentially develop tests to assess treatments.",Perceptual Learning: Human vs. Optimal Bayesian,8323947,R01EY015925,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amblyopia ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Cells ', ' Mentum ', ' Chin ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Eye Movements ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Infant ', ' Judgment ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Macular degenerative disease ', ' Macular degeneration ', ' Maps ', ' neuroplasticity ', ' neural plasticity ', ' CNS plasticity ', ' Neuronal Plasticity ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' Respiratory System, Nose, Nasal Passages ', ' Nasal Passages Nose ', ' Nasal ', ' Nose ', ' Patients ', ' psychophysical ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Tapetoretinal Degeneration ', ' Rod-Cone Dystrophy ', ' Pigmentary Retinopathy ', ' Retinitis Pigmentosa ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Striate area ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' area striata ', ' Testing ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' vision disability ', ' Visual Disorder ', ' Vision Disorders ', ' visually impaired ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Low Vision ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Visual impairment ', ' eye field ', ' Visual Fields ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' improved ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Area ', ' Mouth ', ' Cavitas Oris ', ' Buccal Cavity Head and Neck ', ' Buccal Cavity ', ' Oral cavity ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Funding ', ' brain lesion (from injury) ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Staging ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Blindness ', ' interest ', ' gaze ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' visual processing ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' visual stimulus ', ' object recognition ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Learning disability ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' visual search ', ' ocularmotor ', ' ocular motor ', ' oculomotor ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Monitor ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' Fixation ', ' sample fixation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Instruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Perceptual learning ', ' Retinal ', ' ideal observer (Bayesian) ', ' tumor ', ' active vision ', ' visual information ', ' visual performance ', ' visual process ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2012,281126,0.09535792980345013
"Neural and Behavioral Interactions Between Attention, Perception, and Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this research is to characterize how perception and memory interact, in terms of both the learning mechanisms that help transform visual experience into memory, and the intentional mechanisms that regulate this transformation. The specific goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that incidental learning about statistical regularities in vision (visual statistical learning) is limited to selectively attend visual information, and that this behavioral interaction arises because of how selective attention modulates neural interactions between human visual and memory systems. We propose a two-stage framework in which selective attention to a high-level visual feature/category increases neural interactions between regions of occipital cortex that represent low-level features and the region of inferior temporal cortex (IT) that represents the attended feature/category, and in turn between this IT region and medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub regions involved in visual learning and memory. In addition to assessing how feature-based selective attention influences learning at a behavioral level, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how attention influences evoked neural responses in task-relevant brain regions, as well as neural interactions between these regions in the background of ongoing tasks. We will develop an innovative approach for studying neural interactions in which evoked responses and global noise sources are scrubbed from the data and regional correlations are assessed in the residuals. This background connectivity approach provides a new way to study how intentional goals affect perception and learning. Aim 1 examines the first stage of our framework, testing: how selective attention modulates background connectivity between IT and occipital cortex, where in retinotopic visual cortex this modulation occurs, and how these changes are controlled by frontal and parietal cortex. Aim 2 examines the second stage of our framework, first establishing the role of the MTL in visual statistical learning, and then testing: how selective attention modulates interactions between IT and the MTL, where in cortical and hippocampal sub regions of the MTL this modulation occurs, and how these changes facilitate incidental learning about statistical regularities and later retrieval of this knowledge. In sum, we relate behavioral interactions between selective attention and learning to neural interactions between the mechanisms that represent visual features and those that learn about their relations. This proposal addresses several key issues in the field, including: how attention modulates the MTL, how feature-based attention is controlled, whether different neural mechanisms support rapid versus long-term visual learning, how tasks and goals are represented, and how attention and memory retrieval are related. This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery and rehabilitation of visual function following eye disease, injury, or brain damage.        This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery from visual impairment caused by eye disease, injury, or brain damage. The behavioral tasks that we develop to enhance learning with attention will inform practices for rehabilitating visual function, and the methods that we develop to study neural interactions during tasks will lead to new approaches for diagnosing disorders of visual processing.

"The gist of the space: A space centered approach to visual scene perception  Project Summary  Vision is central to our interactions with the world. Aside from recognizing faces and communicating with people, our daily activities are also organized around two fundamental tasks: recognizing our environment and navigating through it. The research program of Dr. Aude Oliva constitutes a new integration of behavioral, computational and cognitive neuroscience research on scene perception. A growing body of evidence from behavioral, imaging and computational investigations has shown that the perception of complex real-world scenes engages distinct cognitive and neural mechanisms from those engaged in object recognition. To date, however, this evidence has not resulted in a comprehensive framework for understanding scene processing.  Here, the PI proposes to test the novel hypothesis that real-world scene analysis is performed in a network of distinctive brain regions, with each region specialized in representing a different level of scene information. Since scenes are inherently three-dimensional spaces, she will show that the brain capitalizes on information uniquely derived from the space encompassed by a scene, rather than an exclusively object-based description. In other words, before knowing the ""gist of a scene,"" we analyze the ""gist of the space.""  Understanding the nature of the brain's representations of visual scenes is an enterprise that will push the development of fast and reliable rehabilitation strategies for individuals with visual and spatial impairments, and push forward the development of aid-based systems that rely on an understanding of the visual space. Real-world scene recognition is an unsolved mystery that will have implications for neuroscience, computational vision, artificial intelligence, robotics and psychology.

"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control.

"Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now recognized that many visual diseases are influenced by complex interactions between multiple different genetic variants. As a result, our ability to predict susceptibility to visual diseases will depend critically on the computational, mathematical and statistical modeling methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic data. We propose here a bioinformatics research project to develop network modeling approaches for identifying combinations of genetic biomarkers associated with visual disease endpoints. Our working hypothesis is that a systems-based bioinformatics approach using network modeling will play a very important role in confronting the complexity of the relationship between genomic variation and visual diseases. We will first develop and evaluate modeling methods to infer large-scale genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association studies (AIM 1). We will then apply the modeling methods developed in AIM 1 to the inference of genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association data in subjects with and without visual diseases (AIM 2). Next, we will utilize the inferred genetic interaction networks to guide the development of predictive genetic models of visual diseases (AIM 3). Finally, all network modeling methods will be released to the vision research community as part of a popular user-friendly, freely available and open-source software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for visual diseases.          The network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this bioinformatics research project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for common diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.                ",Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics,8514000,R01EY022300,"['Algorithms ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Genes ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Genotype ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Glaucoma ', ' Goals ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' genetic disorder ', ' Molecular Disease ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' Genetic Condition ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Visual ', ' senile macular disease ', ' age related macular dystrophy ', ' Age-Related Maculopathy ', ' Age related macular degeneration ', ' Metabolic Networks ', ' Biochemical Pathway ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Simulate ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Entropy ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' genetic testing ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' Genomics ', ' Genetic Structures ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Data ', ' Ontology ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' genetic variant ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Vision research ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' Network-based ', ' network models ', ' dbGaP ', ' database of Genotypes and Phenotypes ', ' ']",NEI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2013,307800,0.20152198240137228
"Constraints on Visual Statistical Learning in Infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual statistical learning is the process of identifying patterns of probabilistic co-occurrence among visual features, essential to our ability to perceivethe world as predictable and stable. The proposed experiments will provide the first comprehensive examination of infants' detection of complex statistical patterns in visual sequences and layouts b describing computation of probabilistic information by infants from 2 to 14 months. This is a formaive time in perceptual and cognitive development characterized by rapid developmental change in perception and learning of environmental structure. In particular, the experiments will examine how structural variability, cognitive load, and memory limitations affect learning, how contextual cues facilitate or impede this learning, and whether the products of such learning can be generalized toa different setting. In addition, the experiments will provide critical tests of domain-specificity b examining the specific contributions of spatial information to visual statistical learning. The shot-term objectives of the proposed research are to learn how developing perceptual and cognitive skills intract in early development to identify statistically defined patterns. The long-term goals are to clarifytheories of cognitive development that posit a central role for inductive learning by computing probabilitie of observations. The results of this research may have implications for understanding development in children who may be at risk for developmental disorders such as iron-deficiency anemia and autism spectrum disorders, both of which have been characterized as deficits in implicit learning. Such an understanding may lead to assessment tools more closely tailored to early diagnosis and treatment than are presently available.          Visual statistical learning is the process of identifying patterns of probabilistic co-occurrence among visual features, essential to our ability to perceive the world a predictable and stable.

"CRCNS: Neural Reprensentation of Hierarchical Visual Concepts in Natural Scenes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complexity of natural images is potentially enormous: the number of possible images that can be described by a smallish (100 by 100 pixels) picture is practically infinite (10000256), more than all the images the human race has ever witnessed during its entire existence. How can any system process input data of this magnitude of dimensions and interpret/understand it in terms of the estimated 200,000 objects in the world, their spatial layouts, and scene structures? Yet, this is a task that human visual systems routinely perform in a fraction of a second. The secret must lie in the fact that natural images are highly redundant, living in a restricted space inside this universe of almost infinite possibilities, and that mammalian visual systems have discovered and exploited this fact. In particular, we conjecture that neurons and populations are tuned to the statistical structure of natural images, building on previous work showing, for example, that sparse coding ideas can help predict receptive field properties of 'simple cells' in the visual cortex. This proposal has three stages. Firstly, we will perform a statistical analysis of natural images to classify and model the types of visual patches that appear. This will result in a stimulus dictionary, which will be used as stimuli to investigate the tuning properties of neurons and neuronal populations, and a visual concept dictionary which will be used to make predictions for the tuning properties. Secondly, we will perform multielectrode neurophysiological investigation of the tuning properties of neurons, and neuron populations, at different levels of the visual cortex in response to the stimulus dictionary. Thirdly, we will perform data analysis to model the tuning properties of neurons and populations using a combination of model-driven, which assumes that neurons are tuned to statistical properties of images, and data-driven approaches which can be thought of as learning 'neural visual concepts' directly from the neuron's response to the stimuli. Our theoretical approach - for learning the stimuli dictionary, the visual concepts, and performing data analysis - is based on statistical and machine learning techniques. These assume a hierarchical compositional structure for the data which offers the possibility of taming the complexity of natural images and is also consistent with the known hierarchical structure of the visual cortex. Intellectual merit: This research will help understand the structure of natural images, determine models for the tuning properties of neurons in the visual cortex, and develop novel data analysis techniques. It has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the statistical structures of natural images and the neural encoding of these structures, including the population level. This will lead to greater understanding of the visual cortex and also help the development of computer vision systems. Broader impacts: This project is interdisciplinary in nature and should have broad impact in multiple disciplines: neuroscience and biological vision, statistical neural data analysis, computer vision, and machine learning. Understanding neuronal properties in the visual cortex is a pre-requisite to the clinical enterprise of developing therapeutic methods and prosthetic devices for the visually impaired. The proposed research program will help facilitate a new graduate program in Computational and Cognitive Neuroscience at UCLA, an inter-college undergraduate minor in Neural Computation at CMU that the investigators are developing at their respective universities. The investigators also plan to organize workshops in NIPS, COSYNE, as well as to integrate their research into both undergraduate and graduate curriculum in their respective universities. This work will also affect undergraduate students at other colleges, by a summer undergraduate training program in Pittsburgh, another at CMU's Qatar campus. In addition, we will propose a workshop and summer school at IPAM (UCLA). We anticipate that this research will lead to invited lectures, peer reviewed publications and, if successful, will have national and international impact. The PIs have good track record in involving undergraduates, including women and minorities, in their NSF-sponsored research, and will continue to endeavor in the training of the next generation of computational neuroscientists. This project will lead to greater understanding of neural mechanisms and coding strategies in the primate  visual cortex.

"Visual Summary-Statistic Processing in Infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Part of the NICHD's mission is to support basic research in human development. The Developmental Cognitive Psychology, Behavioral Neuroscience, and Psychobiology program supports research to identify links between the developing brain and the environment. The proposed research has been designed to help us understand how the visual environment shapes infants' use of summary statistics to describe the things they see. A growing body of research suggests that adults summarize a great deal of visual information by describing the world with texture-like measurements - instead of measuring exactly what we saw and where we saw it, we often pool information together over large areas by measuring how simple features co-occur and forgetting about exactly where they came from. For some tasks, these kinds of descriptions are useful. In other cases, like recognizing a single object in clutter, they don't work well at all. Understanding the limits of these summary statistic descriptions of our visual world has given us insights into why adults sometimes find visual search difficult (Rosenholtz et al., 2012), why it's hard to recognize single objects in clutter (Balas et al., 2009), and may help us understand conditions like amblyopia or macular degeneration, where we think these kinds of summaries may be nearly all the visual system has to work with. In these studies, we will work with infants and adults to understand how summary-statistic descriptions are shaped by the visual environment. We will use computer graphics techniques to create artificial textures that are matched to natural textures using a model of the early visual system. Our goal is to determine how different artificial textures need to be from natural textures for infants to tell them apart. By using a computer graphics model, we can carefully control what information is available to tell the images apart, which will help us understand what measurements contribute to infants' summary-statistic descriptions as they get older. Further, we plan to measure how well infants can tell real textures apart from artificial ones by measuring how their brain responds to those images. We will use EEG to measure how the brain responds to different kinds of natural and artificial textures. Different neural response reflect different kinds of processing in the brain, and we plan to use the location and the timing of the differences we see in infants' brains to help us understand how summary statistics are applied. These studies support the NICHD's mission and will help us understand the perceptual difficulties that some children and adults have due to visual impairments that force summary statistics to be used all the time.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The human visual system summarizes a great deal of what we see by measuring what we saw, but forgetting exactly where we saw it. This strategy is good for recognizing textures like wood or stone, but makes it difficult to recognize individual objects that have lots of clutter around them. We plan to study how infants recognize textures so we can understand how their visual system learns to summarize information this way, which will help us, understand some visual impairment that result from the visual system being forced to use summaries like this all the time.            ",Visual Summary-Statistic Processing in Infancy,8687212,R15EY024375,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' Amblyopia ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Stone ', ' Biliary or Urinary Stones ', ' Calculi ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Computer Graphics ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Crowding ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Development ', ' Infant ', ' Learning ', ' Macular degenerative disease ', ' Macular degeneration ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' visually impaired ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Low Vision ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Wood ', ' Wood material ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Paired Comparison ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' event related potential ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Texture ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' preference ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' visual processing ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' forgetting ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' deviancy ', ' deviant ', ' Appearance ', ' neural function ', ' Neurophysiology - biologic function ', ' Modeling ', ' biopsychology ', ' biological basis of behavior ', ' psychobiology ', ' response ', ' visual search ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Visual Psychophysics ', ' To specify ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Behavioral Paradigm ', ' shape description ', ' shape analysis ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' visual system development ', ' visual development ', ' vision development ', ' visual information ', ' visual process ', ' spatial integration ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NEI,NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2014,408066,0.19248081807669168
"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions.          Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

"Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A hallmark of human development is the ability to make adaptive changes in perception that occurred as a result of experience. The internal representations that influence perception must be constructed from multiple levels of statistical information that are present in the natural environment. To illustrate what is meant by statistical information, after hearing a bark, there is a higher probability of seeing a dog than seeing a cat (i.e. p(Vdog | Adog) > p(Vcat | Adog). While it is widely believed that information acquired via statistical learning is an essential component of experience-based perceptual development, little is known about the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms that translate experience into lasting perceptual change or how variations in these mechanisms can lead to atypical or delayed development. This proposal addresses three major gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of experience-based perceptual development: 1) the effect of statistical information on neural activity in sensory cortices in infancy; 2) whether deviations in these neural responses predict developmental delays in a high-risk population; 3) the relationship between statistically-induced changes in neural activity and behavioral changes in perception. Aim 1 Characterize the effects of statistical information on neural activity early in postnatal development. Typically developing, 6-month-olds will undergo near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) recording to reveal changes in neural activity in auditory and visual sensory cortices during and after experience with cross-modal statistical information. We hypothesize that infant sensory cortex will exhibit significant changes in activity (i.e., increased activity during an unexpected visual omission) as  result of statistical experience. Aim 2 Examine deviations in statistically-induced neural activity in at-risk populations. If statistically-induced neural responses support typical development in numerous domains, abnormal neural responses to statistical information will predict poor behavioral outcomes later in postnatal life and establish biomarkers that could assist in ameliorating abnormal development. Using data from Aim 1 as a comparison group, we will characterize neural responses in infants at high risk for delays in perceptual and cognitive develop- ment as a result of being born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks). Aim 3 Determine the relationship between statistically-induced neural activity and perceptual change. Visual cortex activity after a visual stimulus produces a visual percept, but the behavioral consequences of visual cortex activity during the unexpected omission of a stimulus are unknown yet are essential to understanding how statistically-induced neural changes support perceptual development. Guided by specific hypotheses, we will correlate neural responses to unexpected omissions to behavior on perceptual tasks.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in perception as a result of our experience are an essential component of infant development and in turn are key to supporting human cognition. The current proposal is significant because it is the first step in a program of research which is expected to lead to a full understanding of how experience shapes the perceptual systems in the human brain starting in infancy. Because this process of experienced-based changes in perception is believed to be foundational for normative development, such an understanding could help predict developmental delays and re-conceptualize a myriad of developmental disorders such as autism, WIlliam's Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment.                ",Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development,8634272,K99HD076166,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cognition ', ' domestic dog ', ' canine ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' Dogs ', ' Canine Species ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Grant ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' hemodynamics ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Development ', ' Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' Premature Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Neonatology ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' occipital cortex ', ' Occipital lobe ', ' Perception ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' visual cortical ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' Visual Perception ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' mental retardation-typical facies-aortic stenosis syndrome ', ' idiopathic hypercalcemia-supravalvular aortic stenosis syndrome ', ' hypercalcemia/Williams-Beuren syndrome ', ' hypercalcemia-peculiar facies-supravalvular aortic stenosis syndrome ', ' elfin-facies hypercalcemia syndrome ', ' Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) ', ' Williams-Beuren Syndrome ', ' Williams-Barratt syndrome ', ' Williams syndrome (WMS, WS) ', ' Williams Contiguous Gene Syndrome ', ' Williams Barratt syndrome ', ' Fanconi-Schlesinger syndrome ', ' Fanconi Schlesinger syndrome ', ' Elfin Facies Syndrome ', ' Beuren syndrome ', ' Williams Syndrome ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Infant Development ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Recovery ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' child neurology ', ' Pediatric Neurology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Attenuated ', ' Shapes ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Near-Infrared Spectrometry ', ' NIR Spectroscopy ', ' Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' postnatal ', ' Sensory ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' sensory cortex ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuroimaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease/disorder ', ' Address ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' comparison group ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,K99,2014,82417,0.15902428766996493
"Neural and Behavioral Interactions Between Attention, Perception, and Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this research is to characterize how perception and memory interact, in terms of both the learning mechanisms that help transform visual experience into memory, and the intentional mechanisms that regulate this transformation. The specific goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that incidental learning about statistical regularities in vision (visual statistical learning) is limited to selectively attend visual information, and that this behavioral interaction arises because of how selective attention modulates neural interactions between human visual and memory systems. We propose a two-stage framework in which selective attention to a high-level visual feature/category increases neural interactions between regions of occipital cortex that represent low-level features and the region of inferior temporal cortex (IT) that represents the attended feature/category, and in turn between this IT region and medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub regions involved in visual learning and memory. In addition to assessing how feature-based selective attention influences learning at a behavioral level, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how attention influences evoked neural responses in task-relevant brain regions, as well as neural interactions between these regions in the background of ongoing tasks. We will develop an innovative approach for studying neural interactions in which evoked responses and global noise sources are scrubbed from the data and regional correlations are assessed in the residuals. This background connectivity approach provides a new way to study how intentional goals affect perception and learning. Aim 1 examines the first stage of our framework, testing: how selective attention modulates background connectivity between IT and occipital cortex, where in retinotopic visual cortex this modulation occurs, and how these changes are controlled by frontal and parietal cortex. Aim 2 examines the second stage of our framework, first establishing the role of the MTL in visual statistical learning, and then testing: how selective attention modulates interactions between IT and the MTL, where in cortical and hippocampal sub regions of the MTL this modulation occurs, and how these changes facilitate incidental learning about statistical regularities and later retrieval of this knowledge. In sum, we relate behavioral interactions between selective attention and learning to neural interactions between the mechanisms that represent visual features and those that learn about their relations. This proposal addresses several key issues in the field, including: how attention modulates the MTL, how feature-based attention is controlled, whether different neural mechanisms support rapid versus long-term visual learning, how tasks and goals are represented, and how attention and memory retrieval are related. This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery and rehabilitation of visual function following eye disease, injury, or brain damage.        This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery from visual impairment caused by eye disease, injury, or brain damage.

"The gist of the space: A space centered approach to visual scene perception  Project Summary  Vision is central to our interactions with the world. Aside from recognizing faces and communicating with people, our daily activities are also organized around two fundamental tasks: recognizing our environment and navigating through it. The research program of Dr. Aude Oliva constitutes a new integration of behavioral, computational and cognitive neuroscience research on scene perception. A growing body of evidence from behavioral, imaging and computational investigations has shown that the perception of complex real-world scenes engages distinct cognitive and neural mechanisms from those engaged in object recognition. To date, however, this evidence has not resulted in a comprehensive framework for understanding scene processing.  Here, the PI proposes to test the novel hypothesis that real-world scene analysis is performed in a network of distinctive brain regions, with each region specialized in representing a different level of scene information. Since scenes are inherently three-dimensional spaces, she will show that the brain capitalizes on information uniquely derived from the space encompassed by a scene, rather than an exclusively object-based description. In other words, before knowing the ""gist of a scene,"" we analyze the ""gist of the space.""  Understanding the nature of the brain's representations of visual scenes is an enterprise that will push the development of fast and reliable rehabilitation strategies for individuals with visual and spatial impairments, and push forward the development of aid-based systems that rely on an understanding of the visual space. Real-world scene recognition is an unsolved mystery that will have implications for neuroscience, computational vision, artificial intelligence, robotics and psychology.

"Constraints on Visual Statistical Learning in Infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual statistical learning is the process of identifying patterns of probabilistic co-occurrence among visual features, essential to our ability to perceivethe world as predictable and stable. The proposed experiments will provide the first comprehensive examination of infants' detection of complex statistical patterns in visual sequences and layouts b describing computation of probabilistic information by infants from 2 to 14 months. This is a formaive time in perceptual and cognitive development characterized by rapid developmental change in perception and learning of environmental structure. In particular, the experiments will examine how structural variability, cognitive load, and memory limitations affect learning, how contextual cues facilitate or impede this learning, and whether the products of such learning can be generalized toa different setting. In addition, the experiments will provide critical tests of domain-specificity b examining the specific contributions of spatial information to visual statistical learning. The shot-term objectives of the proposed research are to learn how developing perceptual and cognitive skills intract in early development to identify statistically defined patterns. The long-term goals are to clarifytheories of cognitive development that posit a central role for inductive learning by computing probabilitie of observations. The results of this research may have implications for understanding development in children who may be at risk for developmental disorders such as iron-deficiency anemia and autism spectrum disorders, both of which have been characterized as deficits in implicit learning.

"CRCNS: Neural Reprensentation of Hierarchical Visual Concepts in Natural Scenes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The complexity of natural images is potentially enormous: the number of possible images that can be described by a smallish (100 by 100 pixels) picture is practically infinite (10000256), more than all the images the human race has ever witnessed during its entire existence. How can any system process input data of this magnitude of dimensions and interpret/understand it in terms of the estimated 200,000 objects in the world, their spatial layouts, and scene structures? Yet, this is a task that human visual systems routinely perform in a fraction of a second. The secret must lie in the fact that natural images are highly redundant, living in a restricted space inside this universe of almost infinite possibilities, and that mammalian visual systems have discovered and exploited this fact. In particular, we conjecture that neurons and populations are tuned to the statistical structure of natural images, building on previous work showing, for example, that sparse coding ideas can help predict receptive field properties of 'simple cells' in the visual cortex. This proposal has three stages. Firstly, we will perform a statistical analysis of natural images to classify and model the types of visual patches that appear. This will result in a stimulus dictionary, which will be used as stimuli to investigate the tuning properties of neurons and neuronal populations, and a visual concept dictionary which will be used to make predictions for the tuning properties. Secondly, we will perform multielectrode neurophysiological investigation of the tuning properties of neurons, and neuron populations, at different levels of the visual cortex in response to the stimulus dictionary. Thirdly, we will perform data analysis to model the tuning properties of neurons and populations using a combination of model-driven, which assumes that neurons are tuned to statistical properties of images, and data-driven approaches which can be thought of as learning 'neural visual concepts' directly from the neuron's response to the stimuli. Our theoretical approach - for learning the stimuli dictionary, the visual concepts, and performing data analysis - is based on statistical and machine learning techniques. These assume a hierarchical compositional structure for the data which offers the possibility of taming the complexity of natural images and is also consistent with the known hierarchical structure of the visual cortex. Intellectual merit: This research will help understand the structure of natural images, determine models for the tuning properties of neurons in the visual cortex, and develop novel data analysis techniques. It has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the statistical structures of natural images and the neural encoding of these structures, including the population level. This will lead to greater understanding of the visual cortex and also help the development of computer vision systems. Broader impacts: This project is interdisciplinary in nature and should have broad impact in multiple disciplines: neuroscience and biological vision, statistical neural data analysis, computer vision, and machine learning. Understanding neuronal properties in the visual cortex is a pre-requisite to the clinical enterprise of developing therapeutic methods and prosthetic devices for the visually impaired. The proposed research program will help facilitate a new graduate program in Computational and Cognitive Neuroscience at UCLA, an inter-college undergraduate minor in Neural Computation at CMU that the investigators are developing at their respective universities. The investigators also plan to organize workshops in NIPS, COSYNE, as well as to integrate their research into both undergraduate and graduate curriculum in their respective universities. This work will also affect undergraduate students at other colleges, by a summer undergraduate training program in Pittsburgh, another at CMU's Qatar campus. In addition, we will propose a workshop and summer school at IPAM (UCLA). We anticipate that this research will lead to invited lectures, peer reviewed publications and, if successful, will have national and international impact. The PIs have good track record in involving undergraduates, including women and minorities, in their NSF-sponsored research, and will continue to endeavor in the training of the next generation of computational neuroscientists. This project will lead to greater understanding of neural mechanisms and coding strategies in the primate  visual cortex.

"Bioinformatics Approaches to Visual Disease Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now recognized that many visual diseases are influenced by complex interactions between multiple different genetic variants. As a result, our ability to predict susceptibility to visual diseases will depend critically on the computational, mathematical and statistical modeling methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic data. We propose here a bioinformatics research project to develop network modeling approaches for identifying combinations of genetic biomarkers associated with visual disease endpoints. Our working hypothesis is that a systems-based bioinformatics approach using network modeling will play a very important role in confronting the complexity of the relationship between genomic variation and visual diseases. We will first develop and evaluate modeling methods to infer large-scale genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association studies (AIM 1). We will then apply the modeling methods developed in AIM 1 to the inference of genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association data in subjects with and without visual diseases (AIM 2). Next, we will utilize the inferred genetic interaction networks to guide the development of predictive genetic models of visual diseases (AIM 3). Finally, all network modeling methods will be released to the vision research community as part of a popular user-friendly, freely available and open-source software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for visual diseases.          The network modeling methods and software developed and distributed as part of this bioinformatics research project will play an important role in the development of the genetic tests that will be necessary to identify those at risk for common diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.

"Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A hallmark of human development is the ability to make adaptive changes in perception that occurred as a result of experience. The internal representations that influence perception must be constructed from multiple levels of statistical information that are present in the natural environment. To illustrate what is meant by statistical information, after hearing a bark, there is a higher probability of seeing a dog than seeing a cat (i.e. p(Vdog | Adog) > p(Vcat | Adog). While it is widely believed that information acquired via statistical learning is an essential component of experience-based perceptual development, little is known about the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms that translate experience into lasting perceptual change or how variations in these mechanisms can lead to atypical or delayed development. This proposal addresses three major gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of experience-based perceptual development: 1) the effect of statistical information on neural activity in sensory cortices in infancy; 2) whether deviations in these neural responses predict developmental delays in a high-risk population; 3) the relationship between statistically-induced changes in neural activity and behavioral changes in perception. Aim 1 Characterize the effects of statistical information on neural activity early in postnatal development. Typically developing, 6-month-olds will undergo near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) recording to reveal changes in neural activity in auditory and visual sensory cortices during and after experience with cross-modal statistical information. We hypothesize that infant sensory cortex will exhibit significant changes in activity (i.e., increased activity during an unexpected visual omission) as  result of statistical experience. Aim 2 Examine deviations in statistically-induced neural activity in at-risk populations. If statistically-induced neural responses support typical development in numerous domains, abnormal neural responses to statistical information will predict poor behavioral outcomes later in postnatal life and establish biomarkers that could assist in ameliorating abnormal development. Using data from Aim 1 as a comparison group, we will characterize neural responses in infants at high risk for delays in perceptual and cognitive develop- ment as a result of being born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks). Aim 3 Determine the relationship between statistically-induced neural activity and perceptual change. Visual cortex activity after a visual stimulus produces a visual percept, but the behavioral consequences of visual cortex activity during the unexpected omission of a stimulus are unknown yet are essential to understanding how statistically-induced neural changes support perceptual development. Guided by specific hypotheses, we will correlate neural responses to unexpected omissions to behavior on perceptual tasks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in perception as a result of our experience are an essential component of infant development and in turn are key to supporting human cognition. The current proposal is significant because it is the first step in a program of research which is expected to lead to a full understanding of how experience shapes the perceptual systems in the human brain starting in infancy. Because this process of experienced-based changes in perception is believed to be foundational for normative development, such an understanding could help predict developmental delays and re-conceptualize a myriad of developmental disorders such as autism, WIlliam's Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment.",Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development,8849468,K99HD076166,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cognition ', ' domestic dog ', ' canine ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' Dogs ', ' Canine Species ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' hemodynamics ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Development ', ' Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' Premature Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Neonatology ', ' occipital cortex ', ' Occipital lobe ', ' Perception ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' visual cortical ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' Visual Perception ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' mental retardation-typical facies-aortic stenosis syndrome ', ' idiopathic hypercalcemia-supravalvular aortic stenosis syndrome ', ' hypercalcemia/Williams-Beuren syndrome ', ' hypercalcemia-peculiar facies-supravalvular aortic stenosis syndrome ', ' elfin-facies hypercalcemia syndrome ', ' Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) ', ' Williams-Beuren Syndrome ', ' Williams-Barratt syndrome ', ' Williams syndrome (WMS, WS) ', ' Williams Contiguous Gene Syndrome ', ' Williams Barratt syndrome ', ' Fanconi-Schlesinger syndrome ', ' Fanconi Schlesinger syndrome ', ' Elfin Facies Syndrome ', ' Beuren syndrome ', ' Williams Syndrome ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Infant Development ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Recovery ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' child neurology ', ' Pediatric Neurology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Attenuated ', ' Shapes ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Near-Infrared Spectrometry ', ' NIR Spectroscopy ', ' Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' postnatal ', ' Sensory ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' sensory cortex ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuroimaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease/disorder ', ' Address ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' comparison group ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' high risk ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,K99,2015,82417,0.15902428766996493
"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions. Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.",Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects,8893998,R01EY022727,"['abstracting ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Attention ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Crowding ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Ag element ', ' Silver ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Swimming Pools ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Visual Perception ', ' Work ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' base ', ' goal oriented behavior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Visual ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' visual processing ', ' Visual attention ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Categories ', ' strabismic amblyopia ', ' Suppression Amblyopias ', ' Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' distraction ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' neglect ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Attentional deficit ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' neural model ', ' neuropsychological ', ' cognitive control ', ' visual information ', ' visual process ', ' information processing ', ' neural patterning ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' ']",NEI,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,318059,0.11997114381186272
"Deciding Where to Look Next: Frontal Eye Field's Role during Natural Viewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to understand how the brain decides where we look in the real world. Many factors influence our eye movements (saccades). For instance, we are more likely to look at salient objects (i.e. those that are conspicuous), such as a bright red balloon in a blue sky. We are also more likely to look at goal-dependent objects (i.e. those that share features with our goals), such as a yellow object when searching for a banana. For several decades, researchers in computer vision have been developing models based on these factors to predict the locations to which we move our eyes. Researchers in neurobiology have also been studying saccade selection, and have suggested the frontal eye field (FEF) plays a large role, as the FEF encodes both visual features and eye movements. But because the FEF encodes both visual features and saccades, it is very difficult to parse FEF activity during natural viewing. For this reason, past experiments have primarily investigated the FEF using simple, constrained tasks with artificial stimuli. In this project, I wil use images of natural scenes, which better approximate the complexity of the real world. I will record with extracellular electrodes from the FEF of awake, behaving rhesus monkeys, while they view natural scenes. In order to determine the FEF's role in the decision of where to saccade next in natural scenes, I will investigate how the FEF encodes visual features that predict saccades. In my two aims, I will test how the FEF encodes salience (Aim 1) and goal-dependence (Aim 2). I will build a model that explains neural activity using visual features (salience and goal-dependence) along with eye movements, which are a confounding source of neural activity. This model will take advantage of computer vision and machine learning algorithms in order to look at the effects of large numbers of correlates and visual features in these natural scenes. The neural data analysis methods developed for these aims will allow researchers that study many brain areas to more easily use natural scenes. Additionally, understanding how the brain chooses where to saccade in natural scenes have important consequences for neurologic and psychiatric health and disease. Several diseases including schizophrenia, autism, and Parkinson's impair the choice of saccades. A better understanding of the link between visual features, eye movements, and FEF activity promises to increase understanding of these diseases and allow the development of novel diagnostic tools.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research aims to understand how the frontal eye field cortex helps determine where we look. In particular, it will investigate how the frontal eye field cortex encodes visual stimuli that drive eye movements, such as salient and important objects. Eye movement decisions are impaired in many diseases, including schizophrenia, autism, and Parkinson's, and this research could help lead to a greater understanding of these diseases and the development of novel diagnostic tools.                ",Deciding Where to Look Next: Frontal Eye Field's Role during Natural Viewing,8909502,F31EY025532,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Banana ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Crowding ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Electrodes ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Environment ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Eye Movements ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Macaque ', ' Macaca ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Lewy Body Parkinson Disease ', ' Idiopathic Parkinson Disease ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Running ', ' Saccadic Pursuit ', ' Saccadic Eye Movements ', ' Saccades ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Testing ', ' Visual Pathways ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Link ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' receptive field ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' extracellular ', ' Visual attention ', ' experience ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' frontal eye fields ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural model ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NEI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F31,2015,36487,0.10977190474343772
"Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A hallmark of human development is the ability to make adaptive changes in perception that occurred as a result of experience. The internal representations that influence perception must be constructed from multiple levels of statistical information that are present in the natural environment. To illustrate what is meant by statistical information, after hearing a bark, there is a higher probability of seeing a dog than seeing a cat (i.e. p(Vdog | Adog) > p(Vcat | Adog). While it is widely believed that information acquired via statistical learning is an essential component of experience-based perceptual development, little is known about the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms that translate experience into lasting perceptual change or how variations in these mechanisms can lead to atypical or delayed development. This proposal addresses three major gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of experience-based perceptual development: 1) the effect of statistical information on neural activity in sensory cortices in infancy; 2) whether deviations in these neural responses predict developmental delays in a high-risk population; 3) the relationship between statistically-induced changes in neural activity and behavioral changes in perception. Aim 1 Characterize the effects of statistical information on neural activity early in postnatal development. Typically developing, 6-month-olds will undergo near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) recording to reveal changes in neural activity in auditory and visual sensory cortices during and after experience with cross-modal statistical information. We hypothesize that infant sensory cortex will exhibit significant changes in activity (i.e., increased activity during an unexpected visual omission) as  result of statistical experience. Aim 2 Examine deviations in statistically-induced neural activity in at-risk populations. If statistically-induced neural responses support typical development in numerous domains, abnormal neural responses to statistical information will predict poor behavioral outcomes later in postnatal life and establish biomarkers that could assist in ameliorating abnormal development. Using data from Aim 1 as a comparison group, we will characterize neural responses in infants at high risk for delays in perceptual and cognitive develop- ment as a result of being born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks). Aim 3 Determine the relationship between statistically-induced neural activity and perceptual change. Visual cortex activity after a visual stimulus produces a visual percept, but the behavioral consequences of visual cortex activity during the unexpected omission of a stimulus are unknown yet are essential to understanding how statistically-induced neural changes support perceptual development. Guided by specific hypotheses, we will correlate neural responses to unexpected omissions to behavior on perceptual tasks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in perception as a result of our experience are an essential component of infant development and in turn are key to supporting human cognition. The current proposal is significant because it is the first step in a program of research which is expected to lead to a full understanding of how experience shapes the perceptual systems in the human brain starting in infancy. Because this process of experienced-based changes in perception is believed to be foundational for normative development, such an understanding could help predict developmental delays and re-conceptualize a myriad of developmental disorders such as autism, WIlliam's Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment.",Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development,9085979,R00HD076166,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cognition ', ' domestic dog ', ' canine ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' Dogs ', ' Canine Species ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' hemodynamics ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Development ', ' Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' Premature Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Neonatology ', ' occipital cortex ', ' Occipital lobe ', ' Perception ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' visual cortical ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' Visual Perception ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' mental retardation-typical facies-aortic stenosis syndrome ', ' idiopathic hypercalcemia-supravalvular aortic stenosis syndrome ', ' hypercalcemia/Williams-Beuren syndrome ', ' hypercalcemia-peculiar facies-supravalvular aortic stenosis syndrome ', ' elfin-facies hypercalcemia syndrome ', ' Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) ', ' Williams-Beuren Syndrome ', ' Williams-Barratt syndrome ', ' Williams syndrome (WMS, WS) ', ' Williams Contiguous Gene Syndrome ', ' Williams Barratt syndrome ', ' Fanconi-Schlesinger syndrome ', ' Fanconi Schlesinger syndrome ', ' Elfin Facies Syndrome ', ' Beuren syndrome ', ' Williams Syndrome ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Infant Development ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Recovery ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' child neurology ', ' Pediatric Neurology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Attenuated ', ' Shapes ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Near-Infrared Spectrometry ', ' NIR Spectroscopy ', ' Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' postnatal ', ' Sensory ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' sensory cortex ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuroimaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease/disorder ', ' Address ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' comparison group ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' high risk ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NICHD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R00,2015,249000,0.15902428766996493
"Crossmodal Correspondences Between Visual and Auditory Features ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We live in a multisensory world, in which stimuli of various types constantly compete for our attention. Information about objects or events typically appears on more than one sensory channel, so that integrating inputs across sensory systems (e.g. vision and hearing) can enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and lead to more efficient perception and action. There is increasing interest in studying how stimulus properties in one sensory modality (e.g. vision) correspond to those in another modality (e.g. hearing). For instance, sounds of high pitch are linked to small-sized visual objects whereas sounds of low pitch are linked with large objects; sounds of high/low pitch are associated with, respectively, visual stimuli of high/low elevation; and even aspects of linguistic stimuli such as vowel quality are associated with visual properties such as object size. Such crossmodal correspondences are important factors in multisensory binding. While information has exploded on the kinds of stimulus features that are reliably associated by human observers across modalities, currently there is little neural evidence to allow a mechanistic account of how crossmodal correspondences arise, or how they relate to synesthesia, a phenomenon in which some individuals experience unusual percepts (e.g. colors) triggered by particular stimuli (e.g. letters. Our goal is to address these important gaps in knowledge, by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying crossmodal and synesthetic correspondences and thus to distinguish between alternative explanations that have been offered. A number of possible mechanisms have been entertained for crossmodal correspondences. These include: Hypothesis A - learned associations due to statistical co-occurrences, which would predict that the correspondences are based in multisensory or even classic unisensory regions; Hypothesis B - semantic mediation (e.g. the common word ""high"" may mediate the link between high pitch and high elevation); and Hypothesis C - conceptual linking via a high-level property such as magnitude. In a series of eight experiments that comprise three Specific Aims, we propose to examine these competing accounts, recognizing that some or all of them may be operative, and that the mechanisms may vary between different types of crossmodal correspondences.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed systematic study of the brain basis of correspondences between stimulus properties across sensory systems will allow critical insights into the multisensory processing involved in perception and action, illuminate the multisensory basis of language and music, and expand understanding of the phenomenon of synesthesia in relation to normal experience. From a practical standpoint, the proposed work will make significant contributions to the design of sensory substitution approaches for people with visual, auditory and other sensory deficits, and the rehabilitation of individuals with multisensory processing abnormalities, including developmental (autism, dyslexia), neurological (neglect) and psychiatric (schizophrenia) disorders.                ",Crossmodal Correspondences Between Visual and Auditory Features,8988153,R01EY025978,"['Accounting ', ' Association Learning ', ' Attention ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Color ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Music ', ' Noise ', ' Perception ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Semantics ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sound ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Auditory pitch ', ' base ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Letters ', ' Shapes ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Word Blindness ', ' Dyslexia ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' sensory system ', ' Modality ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' vector ', ' neglect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' public health relevance ', ' multisensory ', ' ']",NEI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,586366,0.1252906149928529

"The gist of the space: A space centered approach to visual scene perception Project Summary  Vision is central to our interactions with the world. Aside from recognizing faces and communicating with people, our daily activities are also organized around two fundamental tasks: recognizing our environment and navigating through it. The research program of Dr. Aude Oliva constitutes a new integration of behavioral, computational and cognitive neuroscience research on scene perception. A growing body of evidence from behavioral, imaging and computational investigations has shown that the perception of complex real-world scenes engages distinct cognitive and neural mechanisms from those engaged in object recognition. To date, however, this evidence has not resulted in a comprehensive framework for understanding scene processing.  Here, the PI proposes to test the novel hypothesis that real-world scene analysis is performed in a network of distinctive brain regions, with each region specialized in representing a different level of scene information. Since scenes are inherently three-dimensional spaces, she will show that the brain capitalizes on information uniquely derived from the space encompassed by a scene, rather than an exclusively object-based description. In other words, before knowing the ""gist of a scene,"" we analyze the ""gist of the space.""  Understanding the nature of the brain's representations of visual scenes is an enterprise that will push the development of fast and reliable rehabilitation strategies for individuals with visual and spatial impairments, and push forward the development of aid-based systems that rely on an understanding of the visual space. Real-world scene recognition is an unsolved mystery that will have implications for neuroscience, computational vision, artificial intelligence, robotics and psychology.

"Neural and Behavioral Interactions Between Attention, Perception, and Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this research is to characterize how perception and memory interact, in terms of both the learning mechanisms that help transform visual experience into memory, and the intentional mechanisms that regulate this transformation. The specific goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that incidental learning about statistical regularities in vision (visual statistical learning) is limited to selectively attend visual information, and that this behavioral interaction arises because of how selective attention modulates neural interactions between human visual and memory systems. We propose a two-stage framework in which selective attention to a high-level visual feature/category increases neural interactions between regions of occipital cortex that represent low-level features and the region of inferior temporal cortex (IT) that represents the attended feature/category, and in turn between this IT region and medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub regions involved in visual learning and memory. In addition to assessing how feature-based selective attention influences learning at a behavioral level, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how attention influences evoked neural responses in task-relevant brain regions, as well as neural interactions between these regions in the background of ongoing tasks. We will develop an innovative approach for studying neural interactions in which evoked responses and global noise sources are scrubbed from the data and regional correlations are assessed in the residuals. This background connectivity approach provides a new way to study how intentional goals affect perception and learning. Aim 1 examines the first stage of our framework, testing: how selective attention modulates background connectivity between IT and occipital cortex, where in retinotopic visual cortex this modulation occurs, and how these changes are controlled by frontal and parietal cortex. Aim 2 examines the second stage of our framework, first establishing the role of the MTL in visual statistical learning, and then testing: how selective attention modulates interactions between IT and the MTL, where in cortical and hippocampal sub regions of the MTL this modulation occurs, and how these changes facilitate incidental learning about statistical regularities and later retrieval of this knowledge. In sum, we relate behavioral interactions between selective attention and learning to neural interactions between the mechanisms that represent visual features and those that learn about their relations. This proposal addresses several key issues in the field, including: how attention modulates the MTL, how feature-based attention is controlled, whether different neural mechanisms support rapid versus long-term visual learning, how tasks and goals are represented, and how attention and memory retrieval are related. This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning. These advances will shed light on the plasticity that occurs during development and during the recovery and rehabilitation of visual function following eye disease, injury, or brain damage.        This research will improve our understanding of how humans learn from visual experience, and how visual processing is in turn influenced by learning.

"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions. Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.",Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects,9099855,R01EY022727,"['abstracting ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Attention ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Cluster Analyses ', ' Cluster Analysis ', ' Crowding ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Ag element ', ' Silver ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Swimming Pools ', ' Task Performances ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Visual Perception ', ' Work ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' base ', ' goal oriented behavior ', ' Dorsal ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Visual ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' interest ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' visual processing ', ' Visual attention ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Categories ', ' strabismic amblyopia ', ' Suppression Amblyopias ', ' Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' distraction ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' neglect ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Attentional deficit ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' neural model ', ' neuropsychological ', ' cognitive control ', ' visual information ', ' visual process ', ' information processing ', ' neural patterning ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' sustained attention ', ' support network ', ' ']",NEI,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,368557,0.11997114381186272
"Deciding Where to Look Next: Frontal Eye Field's Role during Natural Viewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to understand how the brain decides where we look in the real world. Many factors influence our eye movements (saccades). For instance, we are more likely to look at salient objects (i.e. those that are conspicuous), such as a bright red balloon in a blue sky. We are also more likely to look at goal-dependent objects (i.e. those that share features with our goals), such as a yellow object when searching for a banana. For several decades, researchers in computer vision have been developing models based on these factors to predict the locations to which we move our eyes. Researchers in neurobiology have also been studying saccade selection, and have suggested the frontal eye field (FEF) plays a large role, as the FEF encodes both visual features and eye movements. But because the FEF encodes both visual features and saccades, it is very difficult to parse FEF activity during natural viewing. For this reason, past experiments have primarily investigated the FEF using simple, constrained tasks with artificial stimuli. In this project, I wil use images of natural scenes, which better approximate the complexity of the real world. I will record with extracellular electrodes from the FEF of awake, behaving rhesus monkeys, while they view natural scenes. In order to determine the FEF's role in the decision of where to saccade next in natural scenes, I will investigate how the FEF encodes visual features that predict saccades. In my two aims, I will test how the FEF encodes salience (Aim 1) and goal-dependence (Aim 2). I will build a model that explains neural activity using visual features (salience and goal-dependence) along with eye movements, which are a confounding source of neural activity. This model will take advantage of computer vision and machine learning algorithms in order to look at the effects of large numbers of correlates and visual features in these natural scenes. The neural data analysis methods developed for these aims will allow researchers that study many brain areas to more easily use natural scenes. Additionally, understanding how the brain chooses where to saccade in natural scenes have important consequences for neurologic and psychiatric health and disease. Several diseases including schizophrenia, autism, and Parkinson's impair the choice of saccades. A better understanding of the link between visual features, eye movements, and FEF activity promises to increase understanding of these diseases and allow the development of novel diagnostic tools.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research aims to understand how the frontal eye field cortex helps determine where we look. In particular, it will investigate how the frontal eye field cortex encodes visual stimuli that drive eye movements, such as salient and important objects.

"Crossmodal Correspondences Between Visual and Auditory Features ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We live in a multisensory world, in which stimuli of various types constantly compete for our attention. Information about objects or events typically appears on more than one sensory channel, so that integrating inputs across sensory systems (e.g. vision and hearing) can enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and lead to more efficient perception and action. There is increasing interest in studying how stimulus properties in one sensory modality (e.g. vision) correspond to those in another modality (e.g. hearing). For instance, sounds of high pitch are linked to small-sized visual objects whereas sounds of low pitch are linked with large objects; sounds of high/low pitch are associated with, respectively, visual stimuli of high/low elevation; and even aspects of linguistic stimuli such as vowel quality are associated with visual properties such as object size. Such crossmodal correspondences are important factors in multisensory binding. While information has exploded on the kinds of stimulus features that are reliably associated by human observers across modalities, currently there is little neural evidence to allow a mechanistic account of how crossmodal correspondences arise, or how they relate to synesthesia, a phenomenon in which some individuals experience unusual percepts (e.g. colors) triggered by particular stimuli (e.g. letters. Our goal is to address these important gaps in knowledge, by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying crossmodal and synesthetic correspondences and thus to distinguish between alternative explanations that have been offered. A number of possible mechanisms have been entertained for crossmodal correspondences. These include: Hypothesis A - learned associations due to statistical co-occurrences, which would predict that the correspondences are based in multisensory or even classic unisensory regions; Hypothesis B - semantic mediation (e.g. the common word ""high"" may mediate the link between high pitch and high elevation); and Hypothesis C - conceptual linking via a high-level property such as magnitude. In a series of eight experiments that comprise three Specific Aims, we propose to examine these competing accounts, recognizing that some or all of them may be operative, and that the mechanisms may vary between different types of crossmodal correspondences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed systematic study of the brain basis of correspondences between stimulus properties across sensory systems will allow critical insights into the multisensory processing involved in perception and action, illuminate the multisensory basis of language and music, and expand understanding of the phenomenon of synesthesia in relation to normal experience. From a practical standpoint, the proposed work will make significant contributions to the design of sensory substitution approaches for people with visual, auditory and other sensory deficits, and the rehabilitation of individuals with multisensory processing abnormalities, including developmental (autism, dyslexia), neurological (neglect) and psychiatric (schizophrenia) disorders.",Crossmodal Correspondences Between Visual and Auditory Features,9137687,R01EY025978,"['Accounting ', ' Association Learning ', ' Attention ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Color ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Music ', ' Noise ', ' Perception ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Semantics ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' sound ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Auditory pitch ', ' base ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Letters ', ' Shapes ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Word Blindness ', ' Dyslexia ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' sensory system ', ' Modality ', ' Property ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' vector ', ' neglect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' multisensory ', ' ']",NEI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,565302,0.1252906149928529
"Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A hallmark of human development is the ability to make adaptive changes in perception that occurred as a result of experience. The internal representations that influence perception must be constructed from multiple levels of statistical information that are present in the natural environment. To illustrate what is meant by statistical information, after hearing a bark, there is a higher probability of seeing a dog than seeing a cat (i.e. p(Vdog | Adog) > p(Vcat | Adog). While it is widely believed that information acquired via statistical learning is an essential component of experience-based perceptual development, little is known about the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms that translate experience into lasting perceptual change or how variations in these mechanisms can lead to atypical or delayed development. This proposal addresses three major gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of experience-based perceptual development: 1) the effect of statistical information on neural activity in sensory cortices in infancy; 2) whether deviations in these neural responses predict developmental delays in a high-risk population; 3) the relationship between statistically-induced changes in neural activity and behavioral changes in perception. Aim 1 Characterize the effects of statistical information on neural activity early in postnatal development. Typically developing, 6-month-olds will undergo near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) recording to reveal changes in neural activity in auditory and visual sensory cortices during and after experience with cross-modal statistical information. We hypothesize that infant sensory cortex will exhibit significant changes in activity (i.e., increased activity during an unexpected visual omission) as  result of statistical experience. Aim 2 Examine deviations in statistically-induced neural activity in at-risk populations. If statistically-induced neural responses support typical development in numerous domains, abnormal neural responses to statistical information will predict poor behavioral outcomes later in postnatal life and establish biomarkers that could assist in ameliorating abnormal development. Using data from Aim 1 as a comparison group, we will characterize neural responses in infants at high risk for delays in perceptual and cognitive develop- ment as a result of being born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks). Aim 3 Determine the relationship between statistically-induced neural activity and perceptual change. Visual cortex activity after a visual stimulus produces a visual percept, but the behavioral consequences of visual cortex activity during the unexpected omission of a stimulus are unknown yet are essential to understanding how statistically-induced neural changes support perceptual development. Guided by specific hypotheses, we will correlate neural responses to unexpected omissions to behavior on perceptual tasks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in perception as a result of our experience are an essential component of infant development and in turn are key to supporting human cognition. The current proposal is significant because it is the first step in a program of research which is expected to lead to a full understanding of how experience shapes the perceptual systems in the human brain starting in infancy. Because this process of experienced-based changes in perception is believed to be foundational for normative development, such an understanding could help predict developmental delays and re-conceptualize a myriad of developmental disorders such as autism, WIlliam's Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment.",Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development,9111024,R00HD076166,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cognition ', ' domestic dog ', ' canine ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' Dogs ', ' Canine Species ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' hemodynamics ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Development ', ' Infant ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' infants born premature ', ' Premature Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Neonatology ', ' occipital cortex ', ' Occipital lobe ', ' Perception ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Visual Perception ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' mental retardation-typical facies-aortic stenosis syndrome ', ' idiopathic hypercalcemia-supravalvular aortic stenosis syndrome ', ' hypercalcemia/Williams-Beuren syndrome ', ' hypercalcemia-peculiar facies-supravalvular aortic stenosis syndrome ', ' elfin-facies hypercalcemia syndrome ', ' Williams-Beuren Syndrome ', ' Williams-Barratt syndrome ', ' Williams Contiguous Gene Syndrome ', ' Williams Barratt syndrome ', ' Fanconi-Schlesinger syndrome ', ' Fanconi Schlesinger syndrome ', ' Elfin Facies Syndrome ', ' Beuren syndrome ', ' Williams Syndrome ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Infant Development ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Recovery ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' child neurology ', ' Pediatric Neurology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Attenuated ', ' Shapes ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Near-Infrared Spectrometry ', ' NIR Spectroscopy ', ' Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' postnatal ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' specific language impairment ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' sensory cortex ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease/disorder ', ' Address ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' comparison group ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' cognitive development ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' neural correlate ', ' sensory input ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' ']",NICHD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R00,2016,246507,0.15902428766996493

"Constraints on Visual Statistical Learning in Infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual statistical learning is the process of identifying patterns of probabilistic co-occurrence among visual features, essential to our ability to perceivethe world as predictable and stable. The proposed experiments will provide the first comprehensive examination of infants' detection of complex statistical patterns in visual sequences and layouts b describing computation of probabilistic information by infants from 2 to 14 months. This is a formaive time in perceptual and cognitive development characterized by rapid developmental change in perception and learning of environmental structure. In particular, the experiments will examine how structural variability, cognitive load, and memory limitations affect learning, how contextual cues facilitate or impede this learning, and whether the products of such learning can be generalized toa different setting. In addition, the experiments will provide critical tests of domain-specificity b examining the specific contributions of spatial information to visual statistical learning. The shot-term objectives of the proposed research are to learn how developing perceptual and cognitive skills intract in early development to identify statistically defined patterns. The long-term goals are to clarifytheories of cognitive development that posit a central role for inductive learning by computing probabilitie of observations. The results of this research may have implications for understanding development in children who may be at risk for developmental disorders such as iron-deficiency anemia and autism spectrum disorders, both of which have been characterized as deficits in implicit learning. Such an understanding may lead to assessment tools more closely tailored to early diagnosis and treatment than are presently available.

"Representation of information across the human visual cortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human visual system is organized as a parallel, hierarchical network, and successive stages of visual processing appear to represent increasingly complicated aspects of shape-related and semantic information. However, the way that shape-related and semantic information is represented across much of the visual hierarchy is still poorly understood. The primary goal of this proposal is to understand how information about object shape and semantic category is represented explicitly across mid- and high-level visual areas. To address this important issue we propose to undertake a series of human functional MRI (fMRI) studies, using both synthetic and natural movies. Data will be analyzed by means of a powerful voxel-wise modeling (VM) approach that has been developed in my laboratory over the past several years. In Aim 1 we propose to measure human brain activity evoked by synthetic naturalistic movies, and to use VM to evaluate and compare several competing theories of shape representation across the entire visual cortex. In Aim 2 we propose to use VM to evaluate and compare competing theories of semantic representation. In Aim 3 we propose to use machine learning and and VM to discover new aspects of shape and semantic representation. These experiments will provide fundamental new insights about the representation of visual information across visual cortex. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disorders of central vision can severely affect quality of life and the design of treatments and devices for improving visual function will depend critically on understanding the organization of visual cortex.

"Learning and updating internal visual models ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In line with the strategic plan of the NEI, this project is focused on filling a profound gap in our understanding of neural mechanisms of visual perception. Specifically, we aim to understand how the adaptation of visual cortical circuits contributes to perception. Adaptation is a ubiquitous process by which neural processing and perception are dramatically influenced by recent visual inputs. However, the functional purpose of adaptation is poorly understood. Based on preliminary data, this project tests the hypothesis that visual adaptation instantiates a form of predictive coding, which is used to make unexpected events salient. We posit that cortical circuits learn the statistical structure of visua input in a manner that extends beyond previous fatigue- based descriptions of adaptation effects. This learning is used to discount expected features and signal novel ones. Our project will test this hypothesis through the collaborative effort of three investigators with expertise in human EEG, animal neurophysiology, and computational modeling. Aim 1 will assess the ability of cortical circuits to adapt to temporal sequences of input and to signal deviations from expected sequences. Aim 2 will evaluate the effect of stimulus uncertainty on adaptation and responses to novel events. Aim 3 will determine how adaptation dynamics and responses to novel stimuli are influenced by the temporal constancy of stimulus statistics. Each of these aims involves an experimental manipulation that yields distinct behavior from fatigue- based and predictive coding mechanisms. Thus, together our aims will provide a robust test of our core hypothesis, and provide a much richer understanding of the adaptive properties of cortical circuits. Results from our project will contribute to answering one of the continuing puzzles in visual research, which is to understand the functional purpose of adaptive mechanisms in visual perception. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: . This research is relevant to public health because it aims to uncover the function of visual adaptation, a fundamental aspect of visual perception. This work is thus essential to the mission of NEI because it will provide a more detailed understanding of how visual cortical circuits underlie visual perception, which is necessary for developing treatment strategies for individuals with visual processing deficits and for the development of effective prosthetic devices.",Learning and updating internal visual models,9334881,R01EY024858,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Learning ', ' Mission ', ' Monkeys ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' statistics ', ' area striata ', ' Striate area ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' visual cortical ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' Visual Perception ', ' Work ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Prosthetics ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthesis ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' visual processing ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Scheme ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' discount ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' brain machine interface ', ' area V4 ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' visual area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' visual adaptation ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment strategy ', ' phenomenological models ', ' phenomenology ', ' ']",NEI,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2017,447745,0.1801459758542593
"Crossmodal Correspondences Between Visual and Auditory Features ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We live in a multisensory world, in which stimuli of various types constantly compete for our attention. Information about objects or events typically appears on more than one sensory channel, so that integrating inputs across sensory systems (e.g. vision and hearing) can enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and lead to more efficient perception and action. There is increasing interest in studying how stimulus properties in one sensory modality (e.g. vision) correspond to those in another modality (e.g. hearing). For instance, sounds of high pitch are linked to small-sized visual objects whereas sounds of low pitch are linked with large objects; sounds of high/low pitch are associated with, respectively, visual stimuli of high/low elevation; and even aspects of linguistic stimuli such as vowel quality are associated with visual properties such as object size. Such crossmodal correspondences are important factors in multisensory binding. While information has exploded on the kinds of stimulus features that are reliably associated by human observers across modalities, currently there is little neural evidence to allow a mechanistic account of how crossmodal correspondences arise, or how they relate to synesthesia, a phenomenon in which some individuals experience unusual percepts (e.g. colors) triggered by particular stimuli (e.g. letters. Our goal is to address these important gaps in knowledge, by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying crossmodal and synesthetic correspondences and thus to distinguish between alternative explanations that have been offered. A number of possible mechanisms have been entertained for crossmodal correspondences. These include: Hypothesis A - learned associations due to statistical co-occurrences, which would predict that the correspondences are based in multisensory or even classic unisensory regions; Hypothesis B - semantic mediation (e.g. the common word ""high"" may mediate the link between high pitch and high elevation); and Hypothesis C - conceptual linking via a high-level property such as magnitude. In a series of eight experiments that comprise three Specific Aims, we propose to examine these competing accounts, recognizing that some or all of them may be operative, and that the mechanisms may vary between different types of crossmodal correspondences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed systematic study of the brain basis of correspondences between stimulus properties across sensory systems will allow critical insights into the multisensory processing involved in perception and action, illuminate the multisensory basis of language and music, and expand understanding of the phenomenon of synesthesia in relation to normal experience. From a practical standpoint, the proposed work will make significant contributions to the design of sensory substitution approaches for people with visual, auditory and other sensory deficits, and the rehabilitation of individuals with multisensory processing abnormalities, including developmental (autism, dyslexia), neurological (neglect) and psychiatric (schizophrenia) disorders.",Crossmodal Correspondences Between Visual and Auditory Features,9334867,R01EY025978,"['Activation Analyses ', ' Activation Analysis ', ' Attention ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Color ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Judgment ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Music ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Noise ', ' Perception ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Semantics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' sound ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Auditory pitch ', ' base ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Letters ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Auditory ', ' Event ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Dyslexia ', ' Word Blindness ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' visual stimulus ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' sensory system ', ' Modality ', ' Property ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' vector ', ' neglect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' public health relevance ', ' multisensory ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NEI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,620264,0.1252906149928529
"Deciding Where to Look Next: Frontal Eye Field's Role during Natural Viewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to understand how the brain decides where we look in the real world. Many factors influence our eye movements (saccades). For instance, we are more likely to look at salient objects (i.e. those that are conspicuous), such as a bright red balloon in a blue sky. We are also more likely to look at goal-dependent objects (i.e. those that share features with our goals), such as a yellow object when searching for a banana. For several decades, researchers in computer vision have been developing models based on these factors to predict the locations to which we move our eyes. Researchers in neurobiology have also been studying saccade selection, and have suggested the frontal eye field (FEF) plays a large role, as the FEF encodes both visual features and eye movements. But because the FEF encodes both visual features and saccades, it is very difficult to parse FEF activity during natural viewing. For this reason, past experiments have primarily investigated the FEF using simple, constrained tasks with artificial stimuli. In this project, I wil use images of natural scenes, which better approximate the complexity of the real world. I will record with extracellular electrodes from the FEF of awake, behaving rhesus monkeys, while they view natural scenes. In order to determine the FEF's role in the decision of where to saccade next in natural scenes, I will investigate how the FEF encodes visual features that predict saccades. In my two aims, I will test how the FEF encodes salience (Aim 1) and goal-dependence (Aim 2). I will build a model that explains neural activity using visual features (salience and goal-dependence) along with eye movements, which are a confounding source of neural activity. This model will take advantage of computer vision and machine learning algorithms in order to look at the effects of large numbers of correlates and visual features in these natural scenes. The neural data analysis methods developed for these aims will allow researchers that study many brain areas to more easily use natural scenes. Additionally, understanding how the brain chooses where to saccade in natural scenes have important consequences for neurologic and psychiatric health and disease. Several diseases including schizophrenia, autism, and Parkinson's impair the choice of saccades. A better understanding of the link between visual features, eye movements, and FEF activity promises to increase understanding of these diseases and allow the development of novel diagnostic tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research aims to understand how the frontal eye field cortex helps determine where we look. In particular, it will investigate how the frontal eye field cortex encodes visual stimuli that drive eye movements, such as salient and important objects. Eye movement decisions are impaired in many diseases, including schizophrenia, autism, and Parkinson's, and this research could help lead to a greater understanding of these diseases and the development of novel diagnostic tools.",Deciding Where to Look Next: Frontal Eye Field's Role during Natural Viewing,9266417,F31EY025532,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Banana ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' computer vision ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' Crowding ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Electrodes ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Environment ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Eye Movements ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Macaca mulatta ', ' Rhesus Monkey ', ' Rhesus Macaque ', ' Rhesus ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Monkeys ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Parkinson Disease ', ' Primary Parkinsonism ', ' Parkinsons disease ', "" Parkinson's disease "", "" Parkinson's "", ' Parkinson ', ' Paralysis Agitans ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Saccades ', ' Saccadic Pursuit ', ' Saccadic Eye Movements ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Testing ', ' Visual Pathways ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Link ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' receptive field ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Source ', ' Location ', ' extracellular ', ' Visual attention ', ' experience ', ' visual stimulus ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' frontal eye fields ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' neural model ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' public health relevance ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NEI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F31,2017,35657,0.10977190474343772
"Characterizing and Modeling Infants' Self-Generated Object Views: Implications for Object Recognition and Language Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human visual object recognition is foundational to many achievements—from object name learning to tool use to real world problem solving. Understanding the developmental processes that underlie visual object recognition is of critical importance because the individual differences that characterize early visual object recognition have clinical, educational, and societal implications. For instance, toddlers with poor visual object recognition skills are more likely to have below-average vocabulary sizes. Toddlers with smaller vocabularies have a greater likelihood of developing language impairments and are more likely to lag in pre-literacy and literacy skills. Deficits in visual object recognition and word learning have also been exhibited by individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ADSs). The overarching goal of the proposed project is to better understand the sensory-motor mechanisms that support visual object recognition. Considerable evidence suggests that active object manipulation relates to better visual object recognition, however little is known about the mechanisms through which object manipulation connects to visual object processing during development. The proposed research tests the hypothesis that one major route through which object manipulation matters is that it generates many different views of the same object, and that the variation within multiple visual instances of the same object facilitates visual object recognition by building more generalizable representations for recognizing unseen instances. This hypothesis is tested by (1) characterizing the properties of object information generated by infants during free play and by (2) evaluating the information in those generated visual streams by feeding them to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) – the first computational models of vision capable of human-like visual recognition. Two additional lines of research motivate the approach. First is evidence showing infants learn from statistical regularities in visual inputs presented briefly in a laboratory setting. Second is research using head-mounted cameras suggesting that object views generated by infant manipulation have unique properties, including views dominated by a single object. What we do not yet know are the visual statistics of the views infants generate in everyday toy play or their value for a statistical learner such as CNNs. The proposed research will address these gaps in the literature by characterizing the visual object inputs infants generate and how these inputs may facilitate visual object recognition. The proposed research will also determine how differences in visual inputs may be linked with individual differences in infant object name learning. This research will lead to a deeper understanding of the early development of visual object recognition, and may also provide a crucial missing link in our understanding of the developmental trajectory of other cognitive functions, including object name learning. Moreover, the knowledge to be gained from the proposed research has the potential to inform (1) individual differences in learning, (2) strategies for identifying learning delays, and (3) construction of interventions to remediate learning delays. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to characterize the nature of infants' early visual experiences of objects and their relation to object manipulation, language abilities, and computational models of object recognition. The period of development to be studied – 18 to 24 months – is a period in which delays in visual object recognition and in vocabulary learning have been connected to future development of language impairments and diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). The proposed research is highly relevant to public health as it will elucidate sources of individual differences in early object recognition and word learning, laying the foundation for aiding diagnosis of early language delay and ASDs, as well as the development of future object recognition and vocabulary/language intervention programs.",Characterizing and Modeling Infants' Self-Generated Object Views: Implications for Object Recognition and Language Learning,9395459,F32HD093280,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Infant ', ' Laboratories ', ' Language ', ' Language Delays ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Toy ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' cognitive function ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' Route ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' object recognition ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' developmental disease/disorder ', ' developmental disorder ', ' Address ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Motor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feeding ', ' vision development ', ' visual system development ', ' visual development ', ' Individual Differences ', ' visual object processing ', ' word learning ', ' language impairment ', ' ']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F32,2017,57066,0.13925946470016273
"Virtual prototyping for retinal prosthesis patients Project Summary/Abstract Retinal dystrophies such as retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration induce progressive loss of photoreceptors, resulting in profound visual impairment in more than ten million people worldwide. Visual neuroprostheses (‘bionic eyes’) aim to restore functional vision by electrically stimulating remaining cells in the retina, analogous to cochlear implants. A wide variety of neuroprostheses are either in development (e.g. optogenetics, cortical) or are being implanted in patients (e.g. subretinal or epiretinal electrical). A limiting factor that affects all device types are perceptual distortions and subsequent loss of information, caused by interactions between the implant technology and the underlying neurophysiology. Understanding the causes of these distortions and finding ways to alleviate them is critically important to the success of current and future sight restoration technologies. In this proposal, human visual psychophysics, computational modeling, data-driven approaches, and virtual reality (VR) will be combined to develop and experimentally validate optimized stimulation protocols for epiretinal prostheses. This approach is analogous to virtual prototyping for airplanes and other complex systems: to use a high-quality model of both the implant electronics and the visual system in order to generate a ‘virtual patient’. Retinal electrophysiological and visual behavioral data will be used to develop and validate a computational model of the expected visual experience of patients when electrically stimulated. One way of using this model will be to generate simulations of the expected perceptual outcome of electrical stimulation across a wide variety of electrical stimulation patterns. These will be used as a training set for machine learning algorithms that will invert the input-output function of the model to find the electrical stimulation protocol that best replicates any desired perceptual experience. The model can also be used to simulate the expected perceptual experience of real patients by using sighted subjects in a VR environment – ‘VR virtual patients’. These virtual patients will be used to discover preprocessing methods (e.g., edge enhancement, retargeting, decluttering) that improve behavioral performance in VR. Although current retinal prostheses have been implanted in over 250 patients worldwide, experimentation with improved stimulation protocols remains challenging and expensive. Implementing ‘virtual patients’ in VR offers an affordable and practical alternative for high-throughput experiments to test new stimulation protocols. Stimulation protocols that result in good VR performance will be experimentally validated in real prosthesis patients in collaboration with Second Sight Medical Products Inc. and Pixium Vision, two leading device manufacturers in the field. This work has the potential to significantly improve the effectiveness of visual neuroprostheses as a treatment option for individuals suffering from blinding retinal diseases. Project Narrative Inadequate stimulation paradigms are currently one of the main factors limiting the effectiveness of visual prostheses as a treatment option for individuals suffering from blinding retinal diseases. My goal is to develop and validate novel stimulation protocols for visual prosthesis patients that minimize perceptual distortions and thereby improve behavioral performance. Developing methods for generating better stimulation protocols through a combination of behavioral testing, virtual reality, computational modeling, and machine learning, has the potential to provide a transformative improvement of this device technology.",Virtual prototyping for retinal prosthesis patients,9581681,K99EY029329,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Bionics ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cochlear Implants ', ' Cochlear Prosthesis ', ' Auditory Prosthesis ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Electric Stimulation ', ' electrostimulation ', ' Electrical Stimulation ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electronics ', ' electronic device ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Ocular Prosthesis ', ' visual prosthetic ', ' visual prosthesis ', ' vision prosthesis ', ' prosthetic vision ', ' eye prosthesis ', ' Artificial Eye ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' In Vitro ', ' Learning ', ' Macular degeneration ', ' Macular degenerative disease ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Perceptual distortions ', ' Photoreceptors ', ' Visual Receptor ', ' Photosensitive Cell ', ' Photoreceptor Cell ', ' Prosthesis Design ', ' prosthetic design ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' retinopathy ', ' retina disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' Retinitis Pigmentosa ', ' Tapetoretinal Degeneration ', ' Rod-Cone Dystrophy ', ' Pigmentary Retinopathy ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Visual impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' vision impairment ', ' impaired vision ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Low Vision ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Work ', ' Schedule ', ' Specialist ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' Prosthetics ', ' Prosthetic device ', ' Prosthesis ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Shapes ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' restoration ', ' gaze ', ' Visual system structure ', ' Visual System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' object recognition ', ' neuroprosthesis ', ' neuroprosthetic ', ' neuro-prosthetic ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Retinal Dystrophy ', ' Modeling ', ' virtual reality ', ' virtual world ', ' virtual environment ', ' VR simulation ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Visual Psychophysics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' virtual ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Retinal ', ' Implant ', ' implantation ', ' prototype ', ' retinal prosthetic ', ' prosthetic retina ', ' artificial retina ', ' retinal prosthesis ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' optogenetics ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' deep neural network ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2018,122763,0.0846487879934734
"Millisecond resolution statistics of cortical populations Project Summary/Abstract The mammalian brain builds and transforms representations of the outside world through the concerted activity of populations of neurons, but the extent to which spike times or spike counts are coordinated within these ensembles beyond pairs is not clear. Models of neural encoding predict variable frequencies of spike pattern occurrence, and models of decoding delineate requirements for spike time precision within the population response. While considerable effort has been made toward the development and refinement of the theoretical basis of such neural coding schemes, and predictions have been tested against single cell and pairwise data, there has been relatively little experimental data beyond pairs able to differentiate between competing hypotheses of population coding. The proposed career development plan aims to marry large-scale electrophysiology in primary visual cortex with analysis of specific predictions derived from computational and theoretical neuroscience work for spike time coordination beyond pairwise interactions. The candidate has a deep background in in vivo experimental techniques and proposes to receive training in the high-dimensional computational techniques and to use experimental data collected to validate specific theoretical predictions. This training will establish the skills necessary for a successful independent research career studying the mechanisms of information representation and transfer in visual cortex, bridging the gap between experimental and computational neuroscience. The candidate will carry out the mentored phase under the guidance of Dr. Clay Reid, a world expert in multiple aspects of mammalian central visual processing including anatomy, physiology, and computation. Additional advising from Dr. Eric Shea- Brown and Dr. Christof Koch will provide guidance in the theoretical and applied mathematical approaches required to implement and assess advanced models of neural encoding and decoding. The training will utilize the strengths of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in collecting large-scale data and the didactic opportunities at the University of Washington. In the independent phase the candidate will use the newly acquired analytical and modeling skills in combination with his previous training in optogenetic techniques to better constrain population measurements. This work will help establish a unique independent research program to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cortical representation.

"The nGoggle: A portable brain-based device for assessment of visual function deficits PROJECT SUMMARY Assessment of loss of visual function outside the foveal area is an essential component of the management of numerous conditions, including glaucoma, retinal and neurological disorders. Despite the significant progress achieved with the development of standard automated perimetry (SAP) many decades ago, assessment of visual field loss with SAP still has significant drawbacks. SAP testing is limited by subjectivity of patient responses and high test-retest variability, frequently requiring many tests for effective detection of change over time. Moreover, as these tests are generally conducted in clinic-based settings, limited patient availability and health care resources often result in an insufficient number of tests acquired over time, with delayed diagnosis and detection of disease progression. The requirement for highly trained technicians, cost, complexity, and lack of portability of SAP also preclude its use for screening of visual field loss in underserved populations. To address shortcomings of current methods to assess visual function, we have developed the nGoggle, a wearable device that uses a head-mounted display (HMD) integrated with wireless electroencephalography (EEG), capable of objectively assessing visual field deficits using multifocal steady-state visual-evoked potentials (mfSSVEP). As part of the funded NEI SBIR Phase I, we developed the nGoggle prototype using a modified smartphone-based HMD display and non-disposable electrodes. In our Phase I studies, we conducted benchmarking tests on signal quality of EEG acquisition, developed methods for EEG data extraction and analysis, and conducted a pilot study demonstrating the ability of the device to detect visual field loss in glaucoma, a progressive neuropathy that results in characteristic damage to the optic nerve and resulting visual field defects. We also identified limitations of current existing displays and electrodes, as well as potential avenues for enhancing test reliability and improving user interface. Based on the encouraging results from Phase I and a clear delineation of the steps needed to bring the device into its final commercial product form, we now propose a series of Phase II studies. We hypothesize that optimization of nGoggle's accuracy and repeatability in detecting visual function loss can be achieved through the development of a customized head-mounted display with front-view eye/pupil tracking cameras and disposable no-prep electrodes, as well as enhancement of the visual stimulation protocol and data analytics. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To develop a customized head-mounted display and enhanced no-prep electrodes for improving nGoggle's ability to acquire users' mfSSVEP with high signal-to- noise ratios (SNR) in response to visual stimulation; 2) To optimize and validate mfSSVEP stimuli design and data analytics to enhance the accuracy and repeatability of assessing visual function loss with the nGoggle. 3) Complete pivotal clinical studies to support FDA approval.

"Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex The mammalian visual cortex is critical for vision and has been used as a model for the rest of the cerebral cortex.

"What you see is what you learn: Visual attention in statistical word learning PROJECT SUMMARY Individual differences in the quantity and quality of parent talk and individual differences in infant visual attention predict later vocabulary development, which in turn has the cascading consequences of later cognitive development and school achievement. The proposed research studies how infants prior to their first birthday begin to learn object names, and does so in a unique approach, focusing on how visual information from the infant perspective coincide with parent naming and on how infant looking behavior selects the data to be aggregated and how that selected data changes incrementally in statistical learning. Toward this goal, we will collect a corpus of infant-perspective scenes from 8-12-month-old infants as they play with their parent in a toy room and as parents naturally name objects during play. We will analyze the referential ambiguity of the scenes that co-occur with parent naming events, by showing the scenes to infants and tracking their gaze direction in free viewing. We will use the gaze data to quantify ambiguity in terms of the uncertainty, correctness, and informativeness of the scenes as to the intended object referent. We will then construct training sets for cross-situational learning experiments from the collected scenes by manipulating the mix of high and low ambiguity trials. We will test a series of hypotheses about how infants aggregate information to learn multiple object names.  Moreover, we will feed the trial-by-trial gaze data of individual infants to models to predict final learning outcomes, with the goal of specifying attentional and memory processes that support learning. Our overarching aim of the project is to show that the infant-perspective scenes co- occurring with early naming events have properties that guide and train infant visual attention and in so doing support the learning of names and their referents through the aggregation of information across multiple naming events.

"Representation of information across the human visual cortex ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human visual system is organized as a parallel, hierarchical network, and successive stages of visual processing appear to represent increasingly complicated aspects of shape-related and semantic information. However, the way that shape-related and semantic information is represented across much of the visual hierarchy is still poorly understood. The primary goal of this proposal is to understand how information about object shape and semantic category is represented explicitly across mid- and high-level visual areas. To address this important issue we propose to undertake a series of human functional MRI (fMRI) studies, using both synthetic and natural movies. Data will be analyzed by means of a powerful voxel-wise modeling (VM) approach that has been developed in my laboratory over the past several years. In Aim 1 we propose to measure human brain activity evoked by synthetic naturalistic movies, and to use VM to evaluate and compare several competing theories of shape representation across the entire visual cortex. In Aim 2 we propose to use VM to evaluate and compare competing theories of semantic representation. In Aim 3 we propose to use machine learning and and VM to discover new aspects of shape and semantic representation. These experiments will provide fundamental new insights about the representation of visual information across visual cortex. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disorders of central vision can severely affect quality of life and the design of treatments and devices for improving visual function will depend critically on understanding the organization of visual cortex. We propose to use functional MRI and sophisticated computational data analysis and modeling procedures to evaluate and compare multiple theories of visual function.

"Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the proposed research is to investigate how the brain represents scene geometry and functionality. Recognizing the visual environment is central to our daily interactions with the world. When we walk into a new space, we rapidly recognize whether there is a path to follow, whether there are crossable boundaries, and whether there are obstacles that block our view and potential navigation. The theoretical framework of this proposal is based on evidence that there are distinct but complementary levels of scene representation across a group of scene-selective regions in the brain (Park et al., 2011; Park et al., 2014; Park & Chun, 2009; Park, Chun, & Johnson, 2010; Park, Intraub, Yi, Widders, & Chun, 2007). The PI proposes that scene geometry (e.g., spatial layout, three-dimensional scene boundary) and functionality (e.g., navigability, limitations of a boundary) are two fundamental scene properties represented in these regions. Specific Aims: Aim 1 investigates whether the brain displays acute sensitivity to the presence of vertical boundaries, and how such sensitivity is modulated by the functional impediment that a boundary presents to the viewer's potential navigation. Aim 2 investigates the neural representation of the scene navigability, and how this representation differs from representation of scene geometry. Aim 3 investigates whether the neural representation of real world scenes is modulated by acquired knowledge about the spatio-temporal context of a scene, which are important for functionality of a scene. Throughout her aims, the PI tests medial temporal lobe regions in human adults that process scene and spatial information: with particular focus on anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyri and retrosplenial cortex. Methods include univariate and multi-voxel fMRI pattern analyses (linear support vector machine classification and representational similarity analysis) in combination with both region-of-interest (ROI) based and whole-brain based (search light) approaches. Hypothesis and preliminary results throughout the proposal suggest that scene geometry is represented in the parahippocampal gyrus, while scene functionality is represented in the retrosplenial cortex. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research program will establish new framework for understanding the cognitive neuroscience architecture of scene perception, with the aim of unraveling how the human brain analyzes the geometry and functionality of visual environment in order to guide our actions and navigation in the world.",Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene,9461541,R01EY026042,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Confusion ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Environment ', ' Fishes ', ' Floor ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Research ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Semantics ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' base ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Hippocampal Gyrus ', ' Gyrus Parahippocampalis ', ' Gyrus Hippocampi ', ' Parahippocampal Gyrus ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Height ', ' interest ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' Base of the Brain ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' vector ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' visual spatial ', ' Visuospatial ', ' visual area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' four years of age ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 4 years of age ', ' 4 year old ', ' Impairment ', ' rehab strategy ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' public health relevance ', ' Geometry ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,218064,0.0830749376747545

"Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis Abstract Craniosynostosis affects close to one in 2000 newborns and causes growth restriction perpendicular to the affected suture. Metopic craniosynostosis is the second most common form of craniosynostosis. The metopic suture is an important sight of cranial growth as the brain rapidly expands in the ﬁrst year of life. Patients affected by metopic craniosynostosis will present in the ﬁrst few months of life with varying degrees of narrowing of the forehead and brow, a triangular shaped head, and an abnormal eye position. Surgery is recommended early in childhood to normalize the head shape and expand the restricted skull to prevent complications such as headaches, cognitive impairment, and visual disturbances including blindness.  Imaging with computed tomography (CT) is employed to conﬁrm new diagnoses of metopic craniosynostosis and, together with the physical exam, is used in a descriptive and qualitative manner to assess the degree of head shape abnormality. Several methods have been employed to interpret the information provided in the CT scans to allow surgeons to utilize data for surgical decision making. However, these indices reduce the complex three-dimensional skull dysmorphology into isolated measurements of angles or proportions, require detailed calculations to perform, and no universally accepted standard has emerged so far despite signiﬁcant research efforts and clinical motivation.  In this grant proposal, we aim to increase our understanding of the cranial dysmorphology in patients with metopic craniosynostosis by employing latest results from statistical shape modeling and deep learning. Specif- ically, we will build a statistical shape model of pediatric skulls from CT images of patients with metopic cran- iosynostosis as well as a group of normal controls capturing normal phenotypical shape variations. The distance of a new shape from the normative shape space will represent the proposed Shape Normality Metric (SNM). The SNM will be validated against ratings from experts in the surgical community (current standard of care) who will be asked to assess the dysmorphology of the skulls in our database. To avoid surgeons' subjective bias, we will aggregate their response using statistical methods that compensate for potential individual bias. Finally, to streamline data collection for future research we will develop a head-shape portal that will allow users to upload CT scans of their patients and the system will automatically calculate the SNM.  By developing a severity metric that encompasses the entire extent of dysmorphology in metopic craniosyn- ostosis and establishing a head-shape portal, we will improve our understanding of the spectrum of metopic craniosynostosis, aid in pre-operative and surgical decision making, enable future research, and help facilitate longitudinal outcomes assessments and multi-center communication and collaboration. Narrative This grant proposal aims to improve our understanding of the head shape anomaly associated with metopic craniosynostosis by using recent results from statistical shape analysis and deep learning, with the goal of developing an objective metopic cranioynostosis severity scale.

With this information, surgeons will be able to objectively determine how severely affected their patients are and will be better able to tailor their interventions to the needs of their individual patients.

"CRCNS: Probabilistic models of perceptual grouping/segmentation in natural vision   To understand and navigate the environment, sensory systems must solve simultaneously two competing and challenging tasks: the segmentation of a sensory scene into individual objects and the grouping of elementary sensory features to build these objects. Understanding perceptual grouping and segmentation is therefore a major goal of sensory neuroscience, and it is central to advancing artificial perceptual systems that can help restore impaired vision. To make progress in understanding image segmentation and improving algorithms, this project combines two key components. First, a new experimental paradigm that allows for well-controlled measurements of perceptual segmentation of natural images. This addresses a major limitation of existing data that are either restricted to artificial stimuli, or, for natural images, rely on manual labeling and conflate perceptual, motor, and cognitive factors. Second, this project involves developing and testing a computational framework that accommodates bottom-up information about image statistics and top-down information about objects and behavioral goals. This is in contrast with the paradigmatic view of visual processing as a feedforward cascade of feature detectors, that has long dominated computer vision algorithms and our understanding of visual processing. The proposed approach builds instead on the influential theory that perception requires probabilistic inference to extract meaning from ambiguous sensory inputs. Segmentation is a prime example of inference on ambiguous inputs: the pixels of an image often cannot be labeled with certainty as grouped or segmented. This project will test the hypothesis that human visual segmentation is a process of hierarchical probabilistic inference. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether the measured variability of human segmentations reflects the uncertainty predicted by the model, as required for well-calibrated probabilistic inference. Specific Aim 2 addresses how feedforward and feedback processing in human segmentation contribute to efficient integration of visual features across different levels of complexity, from small contours to object parts. Specific Aim 3 will determine reciprocal interactions between perceptual segmentation and top-down influences including: semantic scene content; visual texture discrimination; and expectations reflecting environmental statistics. The proposed approach models these influences as Bayesian priors, and thus, if supported by the proposed experiments, will offer a unified framework to understand the integration of bottom-up and top- down influences in human segmentation of natural inputs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project aims to provide a unified understanding of perceptual segmentation and grouping of visual inputs encountered in the natural environment, through correct integration of the information contained in the visual inputs with top-down information about objects and behavioral goals. This understanding is central to advancing artificial perceptual systems that can help restore impaired vision in patient populations.

"Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention PROPOSAL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sustained attention – the continuous allocation of cognitive resources to respond to infrequent but behaviorally relevant stimuli – is impaired in many psychiatric disorders and represents an important aspect of cognitive control. Sustained attention requires top-down control and engagement with the external world, which is linked to both frontoparietal and thalamic controlling signals on primary sensor cortices. Despite the extensive behavioral characterization of sustained attention in animal models using the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), very little is known about the oscillatory interaction between the dorsal attention network and thalamo-cortical dynamics and its potential as a stimulation target for enhancing sustained attention. The objective of this project is to dissect the causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic stimulation. I will focus on three regions in the visual thalamo-cortical network: higher-order visual thalamus (lateral aspect of lateral posterior nucleus, LPl), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and primary visual cortex (V1). I will test the central hypothesis that LPl-cortical theta (4-7 Hz) functional connectivity causally coordinates PPC-V1 functional connectivity to facilitate sustained attention. The rationale of this work is that the proposed temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetic perturbations will directly test the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention. Accordingly, the two specific aims are: (1) Delineate the functional role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention, (2) Determine the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetics. This work is significant because it will causally test a convergent model in which higher-order visual thalamus coordinates the parietal top-down control signals onto visual cortex that is crucial for developing circuit- based therapies to enhance sustained attention. The work is innovative due to its integration of closed-loop optogenetics circuit interrogation, multisite electrophysiology, freely-moving sustained attention task, and machine-learning tools for the investigation of the causal role of oscillatory synchronization. The overall positive impact of the proposed study is to provide a more comprehensive map of how the higher-order visual thalamus interacts with the frontoparietal control signal to modulate V1, and thus mediates sustained attention, a transdiagnostic cognitive function that shows impairment in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The implication of this study is that it may reveal a general mechanism underlying the interaction between two higher-order processing structures signaling to lower sensory cortices during cognitive processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sustained attention enables us to focus our cognitive resources on an activity for a prolonged period of time, and when impaired causes profound deficits in both cognition and behavior. Sustained attention is modulated by the thalamo-cortical rhythms. The research generated in this proposal will investigate (1) what oscillatory feature in the higher-order thalamo-cortical circuit is crucial for sustained attention, and (2) how the temporally- precise enhancing or disrupting of a thalamo-cortical oscillatory feature alters the functional connectivity in the circuit and behavioral outcomes mediated by sustained attention.",Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention,9835877,F31MH118799,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Couples ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Exhibits ', ' Ferrets ', ' Foundations ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Lasers ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Miniaturized Electrodes ', ' Microelectrodes ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Striate area ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' area striata ', ' Testing ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Time ', ' visual cortical ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Lateral ', ' Dorsal ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lateral posterior nucleus of thalamus ', ' Lateral Posterior Thalamic Nucleus ', ' Lateral Posterior Nucleus ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II ', ' calcium-dependent CaM kinase II ', ' CaMKII ', ' CaM kinase II ', ' CaM PK II ', ' CaM KII ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Parietal ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' sensory cortex ', ' visual stimulus ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neurotransmission ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axon signaling ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' cognitive defects ', ' novel ', ' Touch sensation ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Attentional deficit ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' Implant ', ' cognitive control ', ' optogenetics ', ' signal processing ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' sustained attention ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2019,36528,0.07183625284670453
"Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex The mammalian visual cortex is critical for vision and has been used as a model for the rest of the cerebral cortex. In spite of this, little is known about the detailed operations of its microcircuits. In fact, the cortex is composed of many different cell types, and, it is likely that each cell type has a particular circuit function.  In the past cycle we focused on four major subtypes of cortical GABAergic interneurons (PV, SOM, VIP and chandeliers) in mouse visual cortex, using two- photon photoactivation and transgenic mice to map connections to and from interneurons in a systematic fashion. We found that interneurons often make synaptic connections with every single neighboring cell, and this promiscuity could be an important feature of the cortical inhibitory “circuit blueprint”.  In the course of these experiments we unexpectedly discovered that groups of coactive neurons, which we termed “neuronal ensembles”, account for the majority of the cortical response to visual stimuli. Moreover, ensembles also dominate spontaneous activity and have distinct spatiotemporal characteristics. Further, using two-photon optogenetics we found by chance that ensembles can be artificially imprinted into the cortex and they can be recalled by stimulating individual neurons, showing pattern completion, even days after imprinting. These intriguing results suggest that ensembles could be multicellular building blocks of cortical function, implementing a population neural code.  To pursue this discovery and test these ideas we now propose an experimental “deep dive” into the properties of these ensembles, in order to characterize their basic phenomenology, understand their synaptic circuit mechanisms and test their role in the behavior of the animal in sensory discrimination. The project will be carried out in primary visual cortex of awake behaving mice and make use of a novel two-photon holographic microscopy method that enables us to image and optically manipulate neurons in different cortical layers simultaneously.  Our work will provide a systematic anatomical and functional description of neuronal ensembles, how they regulate the activity of the cortex and how they can be manipulated and reconfigured. This could help in novel therapeutic strategies by reconfiguring pathological circuits and correct visual deficits. Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex The role of coordinated neuronal activity by groups of neurons in the visual cortex is still poorly understood. In the last cycle of the grant we discovered that one can reconfigure cortical activity in mouse visual cortex using optogenetics, by imprinting and recalling artificial activity patterns, and we now propose to understand how these patterns are build and whether their manipulation can lead to changes in behavior. This work could help to understand how neural circuits in the visual cortex operate and can be altered and also help to design novel strategies to ameliorate amblyopia and cortical cerebral visual impairment by reconfiguring abnormal circuits.  ",Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex,9685191,R01EY011787,"['Amblyopia ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' In Vitro ', ' preterm neonate ', ' preterm infant human ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' premature baby ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' infants born premature ', ' Premature Infant ', ' innervation ', ' nerve supply ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Interneurons ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Microscopy ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Striate area ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' area striata ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Synapses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' visually impaired ', ' vision impairment ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Low Vision ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Visual impairment ', ' visual cortical ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' Neocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' isocortex ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' Injury ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' photoactivation ', ' sensory discrimination ', ' visual stimulus ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' in vivo ', ' Optical Methods ', ' Slice ', ' Pathologic ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' two-photon ', ' 2-photon ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Perceptual learning ', ' Population ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' imprint ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' computer algorithm ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' developmental plasticity ', ' operation ', ' optogenetics ', ' phenomenological models ', ' phenomenology ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' neural network ', ' ']",NEI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2019,394825,0.08348849515455868
"The nGoggle: A portable brain-based device for assessment of visual function deficits PROJECT SUMMARY Assessment of loss of visual function outside the foveal area is an essential component of the management of numerous conditions, including glaucoma, retinal and neurological disorders. Despite the significant progress achieved with the development of standard automated perimetry (SAP) many decades ago, assessment of visual field loss with SAP still has significant drawbacks. SAP testing is limited by subjectivity of patient responses and high test-retest variability, frequently requiring many tests for effective detection of change over time. Moreover, as these tests are generally conducted in clinic-based settings, limited patient availability and health care resources often result in an insufficient number of tests acquired over time, with delayed diagnosis and detection of disease progression. The requirement for highly trained technicians, cost, complexity, and lack of portability of SAP also preclude its use for screening of visual field loss in underserved populations. To address shortcomings of current methods to assess visual function, we have developed the nGoggle, a wearable device that uses a head-mounted display (HMD) integrated with wireless electroencephalography (EEG), capable of objectively assessing visual field deficits using multifocal steady-state visual-evoked potentials (mfSSVEP). As part of the funded NEI SBIR Phase I, we developed the nGoggle prototype using a modified smartphone-based HMD display and non-disposable electrodes. In our Phase I studies, we conducted benchmarking tests on signal quality of EEG acquisition, developed methods for EEG data extraction and analysis, and conducted a pilot study demonstrating the ability of the device to detect visual field loss in glaucoma, a progressive neuropathy that results in characteristic damage to the optic nerve and resulting visual field defects. We also identified limitations of current existing displays and electrodes, as well as potential avenues for enhancing test reliability and improving user interface. Based on the encouraging results from Phase I and a clear delineation of the steps needed to bring the device into its final commercial product form, we now propose a series of Phase II studies. We hypothesize that optimization of nGoggle's accuracy and repeatability in detecting visual function loss can be achieved through the development of a customized head-mounted display with front-view eye/pupil tracking cameras and disposable no-prep electrodes, as well as enhancement of the visual stimulation protocol and data analytics. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To develop a customized head-mounted display and enhanced no-prep electrodes for improving nGoggle's ability to acquire users' mfSSVEP with high signal-to- noise ratios (SNR) in response to visual stimulation; 2) To optimize and validate mfSSVEP stimuli design and data analytics to enhance the accuracy and repeatability of assessing visual function loss with the nGoggle. 3) Complete pivotal clinical studies to support FDA approval.

"New instrument and methods for fast, diagnostic-quality histology of un-embedded bone marrow and lymph node specimens Project Summary Over 600,000 bone marrow biopsies are performed every year in the United States, while hundreds of thousands more lymph node biospies are performed. Histological evaluation of these biopsies is a critical component of care for hematologic diseases including leukemia, lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disease and non-neoplastic conditions such as viral infections and autoimmune conditions.  We have developed a platform that we consider a paradigm shift in the histologic examination of tissues. It is based on a new chemical process, imaging, and image processing approach that we have dubbed Clearing Histology with MultiPhoton microscopy (CHiMP).The CHiMP technology enables visual analysis of entire intact, un-embedded and uncut specimens within a short time-frame and with a resolution that is amenable to primary diagnosis. The significant clinical benefits include: 1) potential for same-day diagnosis, 2) labor and cost savings, 3) access to 3D perspective, 4) increased visual data from same specimen, 5) complete tissue preservation for ancillary studies such as DNA analysis and 6) inherent benefits of digital data such as reduced risk of loss, ready remote review by experts, and amenability to machine learning tools. Hematopoietic tissue evaluation would similarly benefit from these advantages, but unfortunately the systems developed thus far lack the resolution typically needed for visual examination of hematopoietic tissues.  For this Phase I SBIR proposal, an objective is to develop customized optics to improve the resolution of our current microscopes and thereby enable use in the specialized field of hematology. Commercially available objective lenses that are compatible with our immersion medium are either limited to numerical apertures (NA) that are less than one, affecting resolution and image quality, or have insufficient working distances for imaging past the coverslip and surface roughness to obtain complete sections. We will design and test a custom objective lens with high NA and long working distance, suited for our proprietary reagents. Integrating such a lens into our microscope will also require the design of a custom scan lens, custom beam conditioning optics, and a custom polygon scanner.  An associated goal is to develop a novel approach to preparing bone marrow aspiration specimens that will make them amenable to imaging with CHiMP, potentially reducing the need for core biopsies by permitting unambiguous morphologic categorization of cell subtypes in their architectural context, without the routine need for immunohistochemistry, and while preserving nucleic acids for molecular/genetic evaluation.

"Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments Project Summary This proposed project will develop and field-test a device that accurately monitors and controls the circadian stimulus (CS) for Alzheimer disease (AD) and Alzheimer-disease-related dementia (ADRD) patients in nursing homes. Human biology has evolved to have two distinct optical systems: the visual system, by which we see and process images, and the circadian system, which regulates our biological clock and associated biological systems. These two systems have significantly different spectral and temporal responses to optical input. Specifically, circadian stimulation peaks at 460 nm and responds after several minutes of optical activation, while the visual system peaks at 555 nm and responds nearly instantaneously to inputs. All lighting systems are designed and installed in buildings with consideration only given to the photopic (visual) system and all light meters used to characterize lighting buildings are calibrated to measure photopic light, not CS. While a broad and growing body of research has documented the impacts of the circadian system on human health, including regulating sleep and improving cognition in AD/ADRD patients, research on the CS experienced by AD/ADRD patients is extremely limited. Researchers at the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed the Daysimeter, a calibrated light meter that measures circadian light and circadian stimulus. In Phase I of this project, researchers modified an existing workstation-based lighting control system they previously developed for the visual system to include Daysimeter technology, allowing this control system to record CS measurements. The accuracy of these CS measurements was confirmed in the laboratory and field-testing of 20 of devices is currently ongoing in AD/ADRD nursing homes. In this Phase II application, researchers propose adding control features to this device so that lighting can be controlled to optimize CS dosages in AD/ADRD patient environments. Machine learning-based lighting control algorithms will be driven by continuous light level and spectrum measurements as well as periodic (e.g., daily) patient health data. Data from these devices would be wirelessly transmitted to researchers via an Internet gateway and associated cloud-based data management systems. These data would be of immediate value for gaining a better understanding of AD/ADRD patients' CS exposure and could ultimately result in new lighting systems and/or building codes that consider both our visual and circadian systems. Following the development phase, 30 CS-enabled lighting control systems will be field tested over a 22-week test period. Researchers aim to commercialize this CS-enabled lighting control system shortly after the completion of this field test and the Phase II project specifically targeting AD/ADRD nursing home applications. Project Narrative A growing body of research has demonstrated how light impacts human circadian systems and how these impacts can affect sleep, alertness, cognition and agitation in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's-disease-related dementia (ADRD). Still, significant knowledge gaps exist in determining how much circadian stimulation is typically provided to AD/ADRD patients and there are no commercial products designed to control lighting in AD/ADRD environments in ways that promote circadian-related health. This project aims to fill in these gaps by developing and testing a device specifically designed to measure and control the circadian stimulation experienced by AD/ADRD patients in nursing homes.",Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments,9907480,R44AG060857,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Clocks ', ' internal clock ', ' body clock ', ' Biologic Clock ', ' Building Codes ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' relational database management systems ', ' database systems ', ' Data Base Management Systems ', ' Database Management Systems ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Illumination ', ' Lighting ', ' Moods ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Patients ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' light treatment ', ' Photoradiation Therapy ', ' Light Therapy ', ' Actinotherapy ', ' Phototherapy ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Retina ', ' Rotation ', ' Running ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Wakefulness ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Restlessness ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Agitation ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' residence ', ' residential site ', ' Measurement ', ' Planet Earth ', ' Earth ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' meter ', ' interest ', ' Visual system structure ', ' Visual System ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Human Biology ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' alertness ', ' Dose ', ' Feeds ', ' Data ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' active control ', ' feeding ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' circadian pacemaker ', ' circadian clock ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' biological systems ', ' cloud based ', ' health data ', ' circadian ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' appropriate dose ', ' optimal drug dose ', ' optimal drug dosage ', ' ']",NIA,"ERIK PAGE AND ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2019,1159318,0.0008698925469049762
"Neurocognitive basis of attention and eye movement guidance in the real world scenes Summary/Abstract Real world scenes contain a wealth of information that guide where we look and help us search for things in our visual environment more efficiently. For example, if you were looking for a person in a city, you would look mostly on the sidewalk, whereas if you were looking for a car, you would concentrate your attention on the street. Despite the fact that behavioral experiments have increasingly quantified the role of object and scene knowledge in the guidance of attention and eye movements, models of these processes, particularly neural models, neglect the role of visual knowledge. The goal of this project is to determine whether regions of the brain shown to be important for object and scene recognition are involved in visual guidance in natural scenes. Prior results, including our preliminary data, show that the neural activity from object processing regions can be used to predict what object a person is going to look at next. However, critical questions that remain are: is this predictive activity influenced by scene and object knowledge and is it causally related to visual guidance? Answering these two questions are the specific goals of this proposal. Individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy provide the rare opportunity of recording directly from the human brain (intracranial electroencephalography, iEEG), which provides a superior spatial and temporal resolution measure of brain activity compared to other technique. These direct recordings also allow for electrical brain stimulation (EBS), which can provide causal evidence tying the activity in particular regions to cognitive function. Finally, these data will be supplemented by magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to examine whole brain effects in healthy individuals. iEEG and MEG data arising from regions involved in object and scene recognition will be analyzed by multivariate machine learning techniques to continually classify what subjects are viewing on a moment-to- moment basis. Furthermore, we will try to predict what object subjects will view next during free viewing and visual search in natural scenes based on their neural data. We will assess how these neural signals are modified by the presence or absence of information about typical locations of objects or people in the scene that have been shown to guide behavior. Finally, using EBS we will determine if there is a causal link between the activity in regions involved in coding for object and scene knowledge and visual guidance in natural scene vision. If successful, these studies would necessitate a substantial reshaping of models of visual attention in the human brain. The results could form the foundation of a program of research into the neural basis of attention and eye movement guidance in the real world. Attention, perception, and eye movement abnormalities are seen in a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Thus, these studies, and the models that arise from them, have the translational potential to advance our understanding of the neurological basis of these disorders and suggest potential neurally inspired rehabilitation strategies. Narrative Abnormalities in visual attention and eye movement guidance are seen in a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including visual agnosia, neglect, schizophrenia, autism, etc. The neural basis of visual attention and eye movement guidance in the real world is unknown; therefore it remains unknown how neural abnormalities in these disorders relate to real world visual deficits, which is a critical barrier to designing hypothesis-driven remediation strategies. The proposed research will take critical early steps towards understanding the neural basis of real world attention and eye movement control, which has the potential to transform our understanding of these critical visual processes. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of eye movement and attentional guidance, a circuit relevant to a number of disorders, and take a critical step towards developing hypotheses for remediation strategies.",Neurocognitive basis of attention and eye movement guidance in the real world scenes,9830940,R21EY030297,"['Agnosia ', ' Visual amnesia ', ' Primary visual agnosia ', ' Monomodal visual amnesia ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computers ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dyskinesias ', ' Abnormal Movements ', ' Dyskinetic syndrome ', ' Electrodes ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' Environment ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Literature ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' MEG imaging ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' Study models ', ' Motivation ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Persons ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Psychological Bonding ', ' Object Relationship ', ' Object Attachment ', ' Pathology ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Saccadic Pursuit ', ' Saccadic Eye Movements ', ' Saccades ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Semantics ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' visual cortical ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Dorsal ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual Agnosias ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Electrical Stimulation of the Brain ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Parietal ', ' Stream ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Inferior ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' visual processing ', ' Visual attention ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neurotransmission ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axon signaling ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Categories ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' visual search ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' sample fixation ', ' Fixation ', ' Behavioral ', ' neglect ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' remediation ', ' neural model ', ' computer monitor ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' rehab strategy ', ' spatial relationship ', ' visual process ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' attentional control ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2019,234750,0.11960993158866828
"Virtual prototyping for retinal prosthesis patients Project Summary/Abstract Retinal dystrophies such as retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration induce progressive loss of photoreceptors, resulting in profound visual impairment in more than ten million people worldwide. Visual neuroprostheses (‘bionic eyes’) aim to restore functional vision by electrically stimulating remaining cells in the retina, analogous to cochlear implants. A wide variety of neuroprostheses are either in development (e.g. optogenetics, cortical) or are being implanted in patients (e.g. subretinal or epiretinal electrical). A limiting factor that affects all device types are perceptual distortions and subsequent loss of information, caused by interactions between the implant technology and the underlying neurophysiology. Understanding the causes of these distortions and finding ways to alleviate them is critically important to the success of current and future sight restoration technologies. In this proposal, human visual psychophysics, computational modeling, data-driven approaches, and virtual reality (VR) will be combined to develop and experimentally validate optimized stimulation protocols for epiretinal prostheses. This approach is analogous to virtual prototyping for airplanes and other complex systems: to use a high-quality model of both the implant electronics and the visual system in order to generate a ‘virtual patient’. Retinal electrophysiological and visual behavioral data will be used to develop and validate a computational model of the expected visual experience of patients when electrically stimulated. One way of using this model will be to generate simulations of the expected perceptual outcome of electrical stimulation across a wide variety of electrical stimulation patterns. These will be used as a training set for machine learning algorithms that will invert the input-output function of the model to find the electrical stimulation protocol that best replicates any desired perceptual experience. The model can also be used to simulate the expected perceptual experience of real patients by using sighted subjects in a VR environment – ‘VR virtual patients’. These virtual patients will be used to discover preprocessing methods (e.g., edge enhancement, retargeting, decluttering) that improve behavioral performance in VR. Although current retinal prostheses have been implanted in over 250 patients worldwide, experimentation with improved stimulation protocols remains challenging and expensive. Implementing ‘virtual patients’ in VR offers an affordable and practical alternative for high-throughput experiments to test new stimulation protocols. Stimulation protocols that result in good VR performance will be experimentally validated in real prosthesis patients in collaboration with Second Sight Medical Products Inc. and Pixium Vision, two leading device manufacturers in the field. This work has the potential to significantly improve the effectiveness of visual neuroprostheses as a treatment option for individuals suffering from blinding retinal diseases. Project Narrative Inadequate stimulation paradigms are currently one of the main factors limiting the effectiveness of visual prostheses as a treatment option for individuals suffering from blinding retinal diseases. My goal is to develop and validate novel stimulation protocols for visual prosthesis patients that minimize perceptual distortions and thereby improve behavioral performance.

"Function and circuitry of adaptive inhibition in the retina Studies of the visual system face a number of challenges, two of which are the intricacy of the cell types and synaptic connections that comprise the nervous system, and the complexity of the computational processes that underlie vision. Although the retina is one of the most characterized and well understood neural circuits of the visual system, it nonetheless has a great diversity of cell types, connections and computations. The normal function of the retina is to convey information about natural visual scenes, which have complex spatial and temporal structure. The processing of natural scenes has the greatest relevance towards a fundamental understanding retinal function, and the greatest clinical relevance. Yet most studies of retinal visual processing and circuitry focus on responses to simple artificial stimuli rarely encountered normally, such as flashing spots, drifting stripes and flickering checkerboards. With respect to retinal cell types greatest diversity lies in a class of inhibitory interneurons known as amacrine cells. These cells make extensive lateral and feedback connections, and although they form stereotyped connections between each other, excitatory bipolar cells, and ganglion cells that transit signals in the optic nerve, the functional effects of nearly all of these cell types are poorly understood. This proposal aims towards a direct characterization of the functional effects of amacrine cells under ethologically relevant stimuli, including natural scenes. We combine approaches of perturbation and recording using electrical and optical methods as well as computational modeling to characterize the specific contributions of amacrine cells to stimuli that include the representation of moving objects. We take advantage of recently developed computational approaches that can simultaneously capture the retinal response to a broad range of stimuli including natural scenes, capture a wide range of phenomena previously characterized only with artificial stimuli, and that have internal units highly correlated with retinal interneurons. Our goals are to 1) Create a quantitative understanding of the functional contributions of a class of sustained amacrine cells in the salamander retina for specific stimuli including those that represent moving objects and natural scenes, and test hypotheses related to dynamic effects on visual sensitivity and sensory features generated by those amacrine cells 2) Use molecularly defined amacrine cells in the mouse to quantitatively characterize the functional contribution of specific amacrine cell types to specific stimuli including artificial moving objects and natural scenes. These studies create a new way to generate and test hypotheses related to the quantitative effect of any interneuron on retinal output under any visual stimulus. Understanding how retinal circuitry creates visual processing under natural scenes is critical to our understanding of retinal mechanisms and diseases involving the degeneration of the retinal circuitry. In addition, the computational descriptions of retinal responses will be directly useful in the design of electronic retinal prosthesis systems. The retina is a complex network of many cell types, including the most diverse but poorlyunderstood class of cells, amacrine cells. By understanding how inhibitory neurons change neural processing in the retina under natural visual scenes, we can begin to address how these cells and their connections degenerate during retinal diseases, an essential step in designing treatments for these diseases. Furthermore, by creating accurate computational models of the retinal response to natural scenes, this research will be immediately applicable to electronic retinal prosthesis systems that aim to restore vision in cases of photoreceptor degeneration.",Function and circuitry of adaptive inhibition in the retina,9740980,R01EY022933,"['Archives ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Interneurons ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Nervous System ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Periodicity ', ' Research ', ' Retina ', ' retinal degenerative diseases ', ' retinal degenerative ', ' retina degeneration ', ' degenerative retina diseases ', ' Retinal Degeneration ', ' retinopathy ', ' retina disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Stereotyping ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Synapses ', ' Testing ', ' Theoretical Studies ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Measures ', ' Salamander ', ' Lateral ', ' ganglion cell ', ' gangliocyte ', ' Amacrine Cells ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' receptive field ', ' Spottings ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' extracellular ', ' interest ', ' Visual system structure ', ' Visual System ', ' visual processing ', ' visual stimulus ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' Modeling ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Optical Methods ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Output ', ' photoreceptor degeneration ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Retinal ', ' Population ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' retinal prosthesis ', ' retinal prosthetic ', ' prosthetic retina ', ' artificial retina ', ' biological systems ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' prediction of response ', ' connectome ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Injections ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' ConvNet ', ' ']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,392194,0.12263403409827733
"Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches Project Summary The form (or shape) and function relationship of anatomical structures is a central theme in biology where abnor- mal shape changes are closely tied to pathological functions. Morphometrics has been an indispensable quan- titative tool in medical and biological sciences to study anatomical forms for more than 100 years. Recently, the increased availability of high-resolution in-vivo images of anatomy has led to the development of a new generation of morphometric approaches, called statistical shape modeling (SSM), that take advantage of modern computa- tional techniques to model anatomical shapes and their variability within populations with unprecedented detail. SSM stands to revolutionize morphometric analysis, but its widespread adoption is hindered by a number of sig- niﬁcant challenges, including the complexity of the approaches and their increased computational requirements, relative to traditional morphometrics. Arguably, however, the most important roadblock to more widespread adop- tion is the lack of user-friendly and scalable software tools for a variety of anatomical surfaces that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research labs. The goal of this proposal is thus to address these challenges in the context of a ﬂexible and general SSM approach termed particle-based shape modeling (PSM), which automat- ically constructs optimal statistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes without relying on any speciﬁc surface parameterization. The proposed research will provide an automated, general- purpose, and scalable computational solution for constructing shape models of general anatomy. In Aim 1, we will build computational and machine learning algorithms to model anatomies with complex surface topologies (e.g., surface openings and shared boundaries) and highly variable anatomical populations. In Aim 2, we will introduce an end-to-end machine learning approach to extract statistical shape representation directly from im- ages, requiring no parameter tuning, image pre-processing, or user assistance. In Aim 3, we will provide intuitive graphical user interfaces and visualization tools to incorporate user-deﬁned modeling preferences and promote the visual interpretation of shape models. We will also make use of recent advances in cloud computing to enable researchers with limited computational resources and/or large cohorts to build and execute custom SSM work- ﬂows using remote scalable computational resources. Algorithmic developments will be thoroughly evaluated and validated using existing, fully funded, large-scale, and constantly growing databases of CT and MRI images lo- cated on-site. Furthermore, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc use cases for complex anatomies to promote reproducibility. Efforts to develop the proposed technology are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), and its third strategic goal: to bridge biology and quantitative science for better global health through supporting the development of and access to computational research tools for biomedical research. Our long-term goal is to increase the clinical utility and widespread adoption of SSM, and the proposed research will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative This project will develop general-purpose, scalable, and open-source statistical shape modeling (SSM) tools, which will present unique capabilities for automated anatomy modeling with less user input. The proposed tech- nology will introduce a number of signiﬁcant improvements to current SSM approaches and tools, including the support for challenging modeling problems, inferring shapes directly from images (and hence bypassing the seg- mentation step), parallel optimizations for speed, and new user interfaces that will be much easier and scalable than the current tools. The proposed technology will constitute an indispensable resource for the biomedical and clinical communities that will enable new avenues for biomedical research and clinical investigations, provide new ways to answer biologically related questions, allow new types of questions to be asked, and open the door for the integration of SSM with clinical care.","Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches",9803774,R01AR076120,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cardiology ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Feline Species ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Cats ', ' Felis catus ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Computers ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Ice ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Learning ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Mathematic Computing ', ' Math Computing ', ' Mathematical Computing ', ' Medicine ', ' Mission ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Specialist ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Custom ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' biomedical resource ', ' image processing ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Visual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Funding ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' model development ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' NIGMS ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Anatomic Surface ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Pathologic ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' Visualization software ', ' visualization tool ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' computing resources ', ' computational resources ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' image archival system ', ' picture archive ', ' image library ', ' image archive ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' usability ', ' clinical care ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' Geometry ', ' Complex Analysis ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' clinical investigation ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2019,631809,0.10088512645234934
"Natural image processing in the visual cortex Project Summary Signals from the natural environment are processed by neuronal populations in the cortex. Understanding the relationship between those signals and cortical activity is central to understanding normal cortical function and how it is impaired in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Substantial progress has been made in elucidating cortical processing of simple, parametric stimuli, and computational technology is improving descriptions of neural responses to naturalistic stimuli. However, how cortical populations encode the complex, natural inputs received during every day perceptual experience is largely unknown. This project aims to elucidate how natural visual inputs are represented by neuronal populations in primary visual cortex (V1). Progress to date has been limited primarily by two factors. First, during natural vision, the inputs to V1 neurons are always embedded in a spatial and temporal context, but how V1 integrates this contextual information in natural visual inputs is poorly understood. Second, prior work focused almost exclusively on single-neuron firing rate, but to understand cortical representations one must consider the structure of population activity— the substantial trial-to-trial variability that is shared among neurons and evolves dynamically—as this structure influences population information and perception. The central hypothesis of this project is that cortical response structure is modulated by visual context to approximate an optimal representation of natural visual inputs. To test the hypothesis, this project combines machine learning to quantify the statistical properties of natural visual inputs, with a theory of how cortical populations should encode those images to achieve an optimal representation, to arrive at concrete, falsifiable predictions for V1 response structure. The predictions will be tested with measurements of population activity in V1 of awake monkeys viewing natural images and movies. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether modulation of V1 response structure by spatial context in static images is consistent with optimal encoding of those images, and will compare the predictive power of the proposed model to alternative models. Specific Aim 2 addresses V1 encoding of dynamic natural inputs, and will test whether modulation of V1 activity by temporal context is tuned to the temporal structure of natural sensory signals, as required for optimality. As both spatial and temporal are present simultaneously during natural vision, Specific Aim 3 will determine visual input statistics in free-viewing animals, and test space-time interactions in V1 activity evoked by those inputs. This project will provide the first test of a unified functional theory of contextual modulation in V1 encoding of natural visual inputs, and shed light on key aspects of natural vision that have been neglected to date. Project Narrative This project aims to determine how neurons in the visual cortex represent the inputs encountered during perceptual experience in the natural environment, through correct integration of visual information across space and time. In individuals with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, integration is often miscalibrated leading to perceptual impairments. Our study will advance knowledge of the relationship between natural sensory inputs and cortical activity, which is central to understanding normal cortical function and how it is impaired in patient populations.",Natural image processing in the visual cortex,9801995,R01EY030578,"['Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Macaque ', ' Macaca ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motion ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Perception ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' statistics ', ' Striate area ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' area striata ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' visual cortical ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Sensory ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Structure ', ' movie ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' model development ', ' Address ', ' Animal Testing ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' neglect ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' V1 neuron ', ' vision science ', ' visual science ', ' visual information ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' patient population ', ' sensory input ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NEI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,417500,0.10649947201436986
"Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis Abstract Craniosynostosis affects close to one in 2000 newborns and causes growth restriction perpendicular to the affected suture. Metopic craniosynostosis is the second most common form of craniosynostosis. The metopic suture is an important sight of cranial growth as the brain rapidly expands in the ﬁrst year of life. Patients affected by metopic craniosynostosis will present in the ﬁrst few months of life with varying degrees of narrowing of the forehead and brow, a triangular shaped head, and an abnormal eye position. Surgery is recommended early in childhood to normalize the head shape and expand the restricted skull to prevent complications such as headaches, cognitive impairment, and visual disturbances including blindness.  Imaging with computed tomography (CT) is employed to conﬁrm new diagnoses of metopic craniosynostosis and, together with the physical exam, is used in a descriptive and qualitative manner to assess the degree of head shape abnormality. Several methods have been employed to interpret the information provided in the CT scans to allow surgeons to utilize data for surgical decision making. However, these indices reduce the complex three-dimensional skull dysmorphology into isolated measurements of angles or proportions, require detailed calculations to perform, and no universally accepted standard has emerged so far despite signiﬁcant research efforts and clinical motivation.  In this grant proposal, we aim to increase our understanding of the cranial dysmorphology in patients with metopic craniosynostosis by employing latest results from statistical shape modeling and deep learning. Specif- ically, we will build a statistical shape model of pediatric skulls from CT images of patients with metopic cran- iosynostosis as well as a group of normal controls capturing normal phenotypical shape variations. The distance of a new shape from the normative shape space will represent the proposed Shape Normality Metric (SNM). The SNM will be validated against ratings from experts in the surgical community (current standard of care) who will be asked to assess the dysmorphology of the skulls in our database. To avoid surgeons' subjective bias, we will aggregate their response using statistical methods that compensate for potential individual bias. Finally, to streamline data collection for future research we will develop a head-shape portal that will allow users to upload CT scans of their patients and the system will automatically calculate the SNM.  By developing a severity metric that encompasses the entire extent of dysmorphology in metopic craniosyn- ostosis and establishing a head-shape portal, we will improve our understanding of the spectrum of metopic craniosynostosis, aid in pre-operative and surgical decision making, enable future research, and help facilitate longitudinal outcomes assessments and multi-center communication and collaboration. Narrative This grant proposal aims to improve our understanding of the head shape anomaly associated with metopic craniosynostosis by using recent results from statistical shape analysis and deep learning, with the goal of developing an objective metopic cranioynostosis severity scale. Different from previously proposed metrics, our approach evaluates the entire shape as a whole. With this information, surgeons will be able to objectively determine how severely affected their patients are and will be better able to tailor their interventions to the needs of their individual patients. Additionally, surgeons will be able to better communicate with each other and study the effects of surgical intervention on their patients which will improve patient care in the long run.",Data-Driven Shape Analysis for Quantitative Severity Stratification in Patients with Metopic Craniosynostosis,9778826,R21EB026061,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Cranial Sutures ', ' Joint structure of suture of skull ', ' Craniosynostosis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' congenital eye disorder ', ' congenital eye disease ', ' Eye Abnormalities ', ' Forehead ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Head ', ' head ache ', ' Head Pain ', ' Cranial Pain ', ' Cephalodynia ', ' Cephalgia ', ' Cephalalgia ', ' Headache ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Ice ', ' indexing ', ' newborn children ', ' newborn child ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' self esteem ', ' Skull ', ' cranium ', ' Socialization ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Supervision ', ' Sutures ', ' Surgical sutures ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' United States ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' Stereophotogrammetries ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Cephalic ', ' Cranial ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Collaborations ', ' Descriptor ', ' Letters ', ' Deformity ', ' Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Blindness ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' Reconstructive Surgical Procedures ', ' reconstructive surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Agreement ', ' Graph ', ' Modality ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Dysmorphology ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' MRI Scans ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' Normalcy ', ' Normalities ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Stratification ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Output ', ' reconstruction ', ' shape analysis ', ' shape description ', ' clinical care ', ' standard of care ', ' operation ', ' Trauma patient ', ' power analysis ', ' individual patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' web-based tool ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' Patient imaging ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2019,307172,0.02026383303824165
"ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis Project Summary The morphology (or shape) of anatomical structures forms the common language among clinicians, where ab- normalities in anatomical shapes are often tied to deleterious function. While these observations are often quali- tative, ﬁnding subtle, quantitative shape effects requires the application of mathematics, statistics, and computing to parse the anatomy into a numerical representation that will facilitate testing of biologically relevant hypotheses. Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) and its associated suite of software tools, ShapeWorks, enable learning population-level shape representation via automatic dense placement of homologous landmarks on image seg- mentations of general anatomy with arbitrary topology. The utility of ShapeWorks has been demonstrated in a range of biomedical applications. Despite its obvious utility for the research enterprise and highly permissive open-source license, ShapeWorks does not have a viable commercialization path due to the inherent trade-off between development and maintenance costs, and a specialized scientiﬁc and clinical market. ShapeWorks has the potential to transform the way researchers approach studies of anatomical forms, but its widespread ap- plicability to medicine and biology is hindered by several barriers that most existing shape modeling packages face. The most important roadblocks are (1) the complexity and steep learning curve of existing shape modeling pipelines and their increased computational and computer memory requirements; (2) the considerable expertise, time, and effort required to segment anatomies of interest for statistical analyses; and (3) the lack of interoperable implementations that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research laboratories. In this project, we pro- pose ShapeWorksStudio, a software suite that leverages ShapeWorks for the automated population-/patient-level modeling of anatomical shapes, and Seg3D – a widely used open-source tool to visualize and process volumet- ric images – for ﬂexible manual/semiautomatic segmentation and interactive manual correction of segmented anatomy. In Aim 1, we will integrate ShapeWorks and Seg3D in a framework that supports big data cohorts to enable users to transparently proceed from image data to shape models in a straightforward manner. In Aim 2, we will endow Seg3D with a machine learning approach that provides automated segmentations within a statisti- cal framework that combines image data with population-speciﬁc shape priors provided by ShapeWorks. In Aim 3, we will support interoperability with existing open-source software packages and toolkits, and provide bindings to commonly used programming languages in the biomedical research community. To promote reproducibility, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc test cases. This project combines an interdisciplinary research and development team with decades of experience in statistical analysis and image understanding, and application scientists to conﬁrm that the proposed developments have a real impact on the biomedical and clinical research communities. Our long-term goal is to make ShapeWorks a standard tool for shape analyses in medicine, and the work proposed herein will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative ShapeWorks is a free, open-source software tool that uses a ﬂexible method for automated construction of sta- tistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes. ShapeWorks has been effective in a range of applications, including psychology, biological phenotyping, cardiology, and orthopedics. If funded, this application will ensure the viability of ShapeWorks in the face of the ever-increasing complexity of shape datasets and support its availability to biomedical researchers in the future, as well as provide opportunities for use in a wide spectrum of new biological and clinical applications, including anatomy reconstruction from sparse/low- dimensional imaging data, large-scale clinical trials, surgical planning, optimal designs of medical implants, and reconstructive surgery.","ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis",9882865,U24EB029011,"['Adoption ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cardiology ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' electronic communication ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Exhibits ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Manuals ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Medicine ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Programming Languages ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Licensing ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Funding ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Reconstructive Surgical Procedures ', ' reconstructive surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Applied Research ', ' Applied Science ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Normalcy ', ' Normalities ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' medical implant ', ' reconstruction ', ' shape analysis ', ' shape description ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' interoperability ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' commercialization ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Complex Analysis ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' clinical investigation ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2019,340827,0.07666769452952026
"Millisecond resolution statistics of cortical populations Project Summary/Abstract The mammalian brain builds and transforms representations of the outside world through the concerted activity of populations of neurons, but the extent to which spike times or spike counts are coordinated within these ensembles beyond pairs is not clear. Models of neural encoding predict variable frequencies of spike pattern occurrence, and models of decoding delineate requirements for spike time precision within the population response. While considerable effort has been made toward the development and refinement of the theoretical basis of such neural coding schemes, and predictions have been tested against single cell and pairwise data, there has been relatively little experimental data beyond pairs able to differentiate between competing hypotheses of population coding. The proposed career development plan aims to marry large-scale electrophysiology in primary visual cortex with analysis of specific predictions derived from computational and theoretical neuroscience work for spike time coordination beyond pairwise interactions. The candidate has a deep background in in vivo experimental techniques and proposes to receive training in the high-dimensional computational techniques and to use experimental data collected to validate specific theoretical predictions. This training will establish the skills necessary for a successful independent research career studying the mechanisms of information representation and transfer in visual cortex, bridging the gap between experimental and computational neuroscience. The candidate will carry out the mentored phase under the guidance of Dr. Clay Reid, a world expert in multiple aspects of mammalian central visual processing including anatomy, physiology, and computation. Additional advising from Dr. Eric Shea- Brown and Dr. Christof Koch will provide guidance in the theoretical and applied mathematical approaches required to implement and assess advanced models of neural encoding and decoding. The training will utilize the strengths of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in collecting large-scale data and the didactic opportunities at the University of Washington. In the independent phase the candidate will use the newly acquired analytical and modeling skills in combination with his previous training in optogenetic techniques to better constrain population measurements. This work will help establish a unique independent research program to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cortical representation. Project Narrative Understanding how the brain uses population activity to build representations of the outside world is an important step towards understanding not only sensory but also psychiatric and other cognitive disorders.

"What you see is what you learn: Visual attention in statistical word learning PROJECT SUMMARY Individual differences in the quantity and quality of parent talk and individual differences in infant visual attention predict later vocabulary development, which in turn has the cascading consequences of later cognitive development and school achievement. The proposed research studies how infants prior to their first birthday begin to learn object names, and does so in a unique approach, focusing on how visual information from the infant perspective coincide with parent naming and on how infant looking behavior selects the data to be aggregated and how that selected data changes incrementally in statistical learning. Toward this goal, we will collect a corpus of infant-perspective scenes from 8-12-month-old infants as they play with their parent in a toy room and as parents naturally name objects during play. We will analyze the referential ambiguity of the scenes that co-occur with parent naming events, by showing the scenes to infants and tracking their gaze direction in free viewing. We will use the gaze data to quantify ambiguity in terms of the uncertainty, correctness, and informativeness of the scenes as to the intended object referent. We will then construct training sets for cross-situational learning experiments from the collected scenes by manipulating the mix of high and low ambiguity trials. We will test a series of hypotheses about how infants aggregate information to learn multiple object names.  Moreover, we will feed the trial-by-trial gaze data of individual infants to models to predict final learning outcomes, with the goal of specifying attentional and memory processes that support learning. Our overarching aim of the project is to show that the infant-perspective scenes co- occurring with early naming events have properties that guide and train infant visual attention and in so doing support the learning of names and their referents through the aggregation of information across multiple naming events.

"Vision in Natural Tasks Summary/Abstract  In the context of natural behavior, humans make continuous sequences of sensory-motor decisions to satisfy current behavioral goals, and vision must provide the information needed to achieve those goals. The proposed work examines gaze and walking decisions in locomotion in outdoor environments, taking advantage of our novel system for measuring combined eye and body movements in these contexts. Currently we have only limited understanding of the constituent tasks in natural locomotion, or the requisite information, and the proposal attempts to specify these.  in the context of natural gait, the patterns of optic flow are unexpectedly complex, raising questions about its role. The patterns of motion on the retina during locomotion depend critically on both eye and body motion, and these in turn depend on behavioral goals. Our first Aim is therefore to comprehensively describe the statistics of retinal motion patterns in a variety of terrains and task contexts. We will measure binocular eye and body movements while walking in outdoor terrains of varying roughness, crossing a busy intersection, and making coffee. These contexts will induce different gaze patterns. We will provide a comprehensive description of the motion stimulus in natural locomotion and help separate out self-motion signals from externally generated motion. These data will allow a more precise specification of the response patterns in cortical motion sensitive areas. Because of the complexity of natural motion patterns, we will re-examine the influence of optic flow on walking direction in a virtual reality environment and test alternative explanations for the role of flow.  A central task in walking is foot placement, and we will focus on identifying the image properties that make a good foothold. Stereo, structure from motion, and spatial image structure are all likely contenders. We directly investigate the role of stereo in foothold selection by examining gait patterns in stereo-deficient subjects in terrains with varying degrees of roughness. Using a different strategy, we will attempt to predict gaze locations and footholds in rough terrain using convolution neural nets (CNN’s) to identify potential search templates for footholds in rough terrain. We will describe fixation patterns from crosswalk and sidewalk navigation and attempt to make inferences about their purpose, and use Modular Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MIRL) to predict direction decisions and decompose the behavior into sub-tasks.  The collection of integrated gaze, body kinematics, and scene images in a range of natural environments is innovative, as little comparable data exists The work will be strengthened by the investigation of stereo- deficient subjects for whom there is almost no integrated eye and body data. Since much of the work in robotics has no visual input at all this should help in development of visual guidance for robots and also help better define the necessary information for individuals with impaired vision. The data set will be made publicly available. Project Narrative  The central goal of this work is to understand vision in its natural context. This is very important information in order to devise suitable vision aids and rehabilitation strategies for individuals with visual impairments, and it is becoming increasingly accessible because of developments in technology for monitoring eye and body movements. The proposed work examines gaze and walking decisions in locomotion in outdoor environments, taking advantage of our novel system for measuring combined eye and body movements in these contexts. Currently we have only limited understanding of the constituent tasks and requisite information in natural locomotion, and the proposal attempts to specify these.

"Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma This project will use a combination of structural and functional measurements to test the hypothesis that early- stage damage in human glaucoma occurs first in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina – especially its OFF sub-lamina – as suggested by murine glaucoma models. In the first Aim, we will use a novel visible-light optical coherence tomograph (VIS OCT) to study structural changes in the retina of glaucoma patients. The newly developed VIS OCT has sufficient image contrast and resolution to segment the IPL boundaries and to define sub-lamination in volumetric OCT data, something not currently possible with existing near-infrared OCT instruments. We will make comparative measurements within the IPL and between the IPL, the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Because data from mouse models of glaucoma suggests that early damage occurs preferentially within the OFF sub-lamina of the IPL, we will make separate VIS OCT measurements biased for the OFF- and ON-sublaminae of the IPL and use machine learning approaches to determine whether a similar damage process can be demonstrated in human. To test whether OFF-pathway function is preferentially lost in glaucoma, we will use a novel Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) paradigm that employs sawtooth increments and decrements to bias the measurement to ON vs OFF pathways, respectively, a paradigm our data suggests discriminates glaucoma from control patients. The second Aim will optimize this SSVEP measurement for testing localized areas of the visual field. The third Aim will make comparative measurements of visual-field, VIS OCT and SSVEP loss patterns in a large sample of glaucoma patients and in age- and sex-matched controls. Thickness and interface reflectivity amplitude maps derived from VIS OCT imaging of the RNFL, GCL and IPL including sublaminae will be correlated topographically with visual field defects to assess the relative sensitivity of our structural biomarkers at and near visual field locations with demonstrable losses on conventional (Humphrey) perimetry. Similarly, SSVEP responses from different locations in the visual field will be correlated topographically with visual field loss patterns and to VIS OCT losses, with special emphasis on correlating structural damage in OFF vs ON sub-laminae of the IPL with the functional correlates derived from regional decremental and incremental SSVEPs. Separately and in combination, our structural and functional measurements are designed to provide strong tests of the biological hypothesis that the OFF pathway is preferentially damaged in human glaucoma, and to reveal new biomarkers for the disease. Improving visual outcomes in glaucoma will require a better understanding of the earliest sites and processes of damage and methods to measure them quickly and accurately in patients. This project will address both needs through a combination of novel Optical Coherence Tomography and electrophysiological measurements. The new imaging and electrophysiological tests that will be developed here, either separately or together, could eventually replace conventional visual field testing which is time-consuming and unreliable.",Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma,9765006,R01EY030361,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Electrodes ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Elements ', ' Visual Evoked Response ', ' Visual Evoked Potentials ', ' Visual evoked cortical potential ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Glaucoma ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Noise ', ' second cranial nerve disorder ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Diseases ', ' Optic Neuropathy ', ' Optic Nerve Diseases ', ' Neural-Optical Lesion ', ' Cranial Nerve II Disorder ', ' Cranial Nerve II Diseases ', ' optic nerve disorder ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' Patients ', ' Perimetry ', ' Retina ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' visual field defect ', ' Visual field scotoma ', ' Visual Field Disorder ', ' Scotoma ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' synapse ', ' Synaptic ', ' Synapses ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' eye field ', ' Visual Fields ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' ganglion cell ', ' gangliocyte ', ' Visual ', ' Visible Radiation ', ' Visible Light Radiation ', ' Visible Light ', ' Measurement ', ' Atrophic ', ' Atrophy ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' cell injury ', ' cell damage ', ' Cellular injury ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Inner Plexiform Layer ', ' Resolution ', ' Ganglion Cell Layer ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Modification ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Retinal ', ' Consumption ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' visual area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' extrastriate area ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' comparative ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' retinal nerve fiber layer ', ' RNFL ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Structural defect ', ' structural anomalies ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' Structural malformation ', ' contrast imaging ', ' retinal imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' ']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,551932,0.20327960834286568
"Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention PROPOSAL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sustained attention – the continuous allocation of cognitive resources to respond to infrequent but behaviorally relevant stimuli – is impaired in many psychiatric disorders and represents an important aspect of cognitive control. Sustained attention requires top-down control and engagement with the external world, which is linked to both frontoparietal and thalamic controlling signals on primary sensor cortices. Despite the extensive behavioral characterization of sustained attention in animal models using the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), very little is known about the oscillatory interaction between the dorsal attention network and thalamo-cortical dynamics and its potential as a stimulation target for enhancing sustained attention. The objective of this project is to dissect the causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic stimulation. I will focus on three regions in the visual thalamo-cortical network: higher-order visual thalamus (lateral aspect of lateral posterior nucleus, LPl), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and primary visual cortex (V1). I will test the central hypothesis that LPl-cortical theta (4-7 Hz) functional connectivity causally coordinates PPC-V1 functional connectivity to facilitate sustained attention. The rationale of this work is that the proposed temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetic perturbations will directly test the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention. Accordingly, the two specific aims are: (1) Delineate the functional role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention, (2) Determine the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetics. This work is significant because it will causally test a convergent model in which higher-order visual thalamus coordinates the parietal top-down control signals onto visual cortex that is crucial for developing circuit- based therapies to enhance sustained attention. The work is innovative due to its integration of closed-loop optogenetics circuit interrogation, multisite electrophysiology, freely-moving sustained attention task, and machine-learning tools for the investigation of the causal role of oscillatory synchronization. The overall positive impact of the proposed study is to provide a more comprehensive map of how the higher-order visual thalamus interacts with the frontoparietal control signal to modulate V1, and thus mediates sustained attention, a transdiagnostic cognitive function that shows impairment in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The implication of this study is that it may reveal a general mechanism underlying the interaction between two higher-order processing structures signaling to lower sensory cortices during cognitive processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sustained attention enables us to focus our cognitive resources on an activity for a prolonged period of time, and when impaired causes profound deficits in both cognition and behavior. Sustained attention is modulated by the thalamo-cortical rhythms. The research generated in this proposal will investigate (1) what oscillatory feature in the higher-order thalamo-cortical circuit is crucial for sustained attention, and (2) how the temporally- precise enhancing or disrupting of a thalamo-cortical oscillatory feature alters the functional connectivity in the circuit and behavioral outcomes mediated by sustained attention.",Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention,9970165,F31MH118799,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Couples ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Exhibits ', ' Ferrets ', ' Foundations ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Microelectrodes ', ' Miniaturized Electrodes ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Time ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Lateral ', ' Dorsal ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Lateral Posterior Nucleus ', ' Lateral Posterior Thalamic Nucleus ', ' Lateral posterior nucleus of thalamus ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' CaM KII ', ' CaM PK II ', ' CaM kinase II ', ' CaMKII ', ' calcium-dependent CaM kinase II ', ' calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' cognitive function ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Parietal ', ' Techniques ', ' Performance ', ' sensory cortex ', ' visual stimulus ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' cognitive defects ', ' Cognitive deficits ', ' novel ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' AD/HD ', ' ADHD ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Attentional deficit ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' Implant ', ' cognitive control ', ' optogenetics ', ' signal processing ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' sustained attention ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2020,37032,0.07183625284670453
"Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments Project Summary This proposed project will develop and field-test a device that accurately monitors and controls the circadian stimulus (CS) for Alzheimer disease (AD) and Alzheimer-disease-related dementia (ADRD) patients in nursing homes. Human biology has evolved to have two distinct optical systems: the visual system, by which we see and process images, and the circadian system, which regulates our biological clock and associated biological systems. These two systems have significantly different spectral and temporal responses to optical input. Specifically, circadian stimulation peaks at 460 nm and responds after several minutes of optical activation, while the visual system peaks at 555 nm and responds nearly instantaneously to inputs. All lighting systems are designed and installed in buildings with consideration only given to the photopic (visual) system and all light meters used to characterize lighting buildings are calibrated to measure photopic light, not CS. While a broad and growing body of research has documented the impacts of the circadian system on human health, including regulating sleep and improving cognition in AD/ADRD patients, research on the CS experienced by AD/ADRD patients is extremely limited. Researchers at the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed the Daysimeter, a calibrated light meter that measures circadian light and circadian stimulus. In Phase I of this project, researchers modified an existing workstation-based lighting control system they previously developed for the visual system to include Daysimeter technology, allowing this control system to record CS measurements. The accuracy of these CS measurements was confirmed in the laboratory and field-testing of 20 of devices is currently ongoing in AD/ADRD nursing homes. In this Phase II application, researchers propose adding control features to this device so that lighting can be controlled to optimize CS dosages in AD/ADRD patient environments. Machine learning-based lighting control algorithms will be driven by continuous light level and spectrum measurements as well as periodic (e.g., daily) patient health data. Data from these devices would be wirelessly transmitted to researchers via an Internet gateway and associated cloud-based data management systems. These data would be of immediate value for gaining a better understanding of AD/ADRD patients' CS exposure and could ultimately result in new lighting systems and/or building codes that consider both our visual and circadian systems. Following the development phase, 30 CS-enabled lighting control systems will be field tested over a 22-week test period. Researchers aim to commercialize this CS-enabled lighting control system shortly after the completion of this field test and the Phase II project specifically targeting AD/ADRD nursing home applications. Project Narrative A growing body of research has demonstrated how light impacts human circadian systems and how these impacts can affect sleep, alertness, cognition and agitation in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's-disease-related dementia (ADRD). Still, significant knowledge gaps exist in determining how much circadian stimulation is typically provided to AD/ADRD patients and there are no commercial products designed to control lighting in AD/ADRD environments in ways that promote circadian-related health. This project aims to fill in these gaps by developing and testing a device specifically designed to measure and control the circadian stimulation experienced by AD/ADRD patients in nursing homes.",Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments,10018621,R44AG060857,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Clocks ', ' Biologic Clock ', ' body clock ', ' internal clock ', ' Building Codes ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Database Management Systems ', ' Data Base Management ', ' Data Base Management Systems ', ' database management ', ' database systems ', ' relational database management systems ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Moods ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Phototherapy ', ' Actinotherapy ', ' Light Therapy ', ' Photoradiation Therapy ', ' light treatment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Retina ', ' Rotation ', ' Running ', ' Sleep ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Wakefulness ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Restlessness ', ' falls ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Measurement ', ' Earth ', ' Planet Earth ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' meter ', ' interest ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Human Biology ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' alertness ', ' Dose ', ' Feeds ', ' Data ', ' device development ', ' instrument development ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' active control ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' circadian clock ', ' circadian pacemaker ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' biological systems ', ' cloud based ', ' health data ', ' circadian ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' optimal drug dosage ', ' optimal drug dose ', ' appropriate dose ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIA,"ERIK PAGE AND ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2020,940033,0.0008698925469049762
"Elucidating novel features of visual processing and physiological connectivity from retina to primary visual cortex Project Summary The use of stimuli with increasingly naturalistic properties has become critical to advance our understanding of vision. Many studies demonstrate that simple artificial stimuli (e.g. sinusoidal gratings and white noise) fail to engage nonlinearities that profoundly alter responses in the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and primary visual cortex (V1). A recent and striking example comes from the use of naturalistic ‘flow’ stimuli, which engage robust responses in V1 that are not predicted from responses to gratings. This gap in understanding motivates the development of a stimulus ensemble and analysis framework that produces a quantitative understanding of visual processing to increasingly naturalistic stimuli and the nonlinearities that they engage. Our objective is to understand how flow stimuli are processed from retina through visual cortex. To meet this goal, we will make neural population recordings in retina (Aims 1 & 3), LGN (Aims 1 & 3) and V1 (Aim 3) using matched experimental conditions and a unified theoretical/modeling framework to map the transformations that occur across these stages of visual processing. Our central hypothesis is that V1 transforms a discrete and heavily light-level-de- pendent retinal representation of natural stimuli into a continuous (uniform) representation that is relatively in- variant to changes in the mean luminance. This invariance places a strong constraint on the class of nonlineari- ties that transform retinal responses to those observed in LGN and V1. We test this hypothesis in three aims: (1) determine early visual processing (retina & LGN) of naturalistic flow stimuli; (2) develop an encoding manifold to capture the population activity at each processing stage and transforms from one stage to the next; (3) test the ability of the manifold description to predict the impact of light adaptation on processing flow stimuli from retina to V1. Aim 1 will yield a matched experimental dataset to an interesting and novel class of ecologically-relevant stimuli. Aim 2 will yield a quantitative framework by which to understand the transformations that occur between retina, LGN, and V1. Aim 3 will provide a platform for globally perturbing the output of the retina by switching from photopic to mesopic and scotopic conditions, and thereby compare predictions of our model to measured changes in LGN and V1 activity. The primary significance of this research is that it will provide a computationally and experimentally unified framework for understanding the transformations that occur in the processing of stim- uli across multiple stages of visual processing. The major innovations are (1) presenting visual stimuli for retinal recordings that are matched to eye movements and pupil dynamics in alert animals; (2) creating a novel analysis framework that captures the responses of neurons at all three levels and the inter-level transformations to in- creasingly complex stimuli; (3) utilizing light adaptation as a method of perturbing retinal output to test our model and the stability (invariance) of LGN and V1 responses to adapting retinal signals. The expected outcome is a data-driven model of the processing from retina to LGN and V1 that generalizes from starlight to sunlight. Project Narrative Restoring vision to the blind likely requires understanding how retinal signals are communicated to the brain and how these signals are transformed in the thalamocortical pathway. This project aims to acquire an understanding of these transformations in the context of complex and more naturalistic visual stimuli.",Elucidating novel features of visual processing and physiological connectivity from retina to primary visual cortex,10050840,R01EY031059,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Environment ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maps ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Noise ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Pupil ', ' Research ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Sunlight ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' lateral geniculate ', ' lateral geniculate nucleus ', ' Lateral Geniculate Body ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Stimulus ', ' function luminance ', ' luminance ', ' receptive field ', ' Light Adaptations ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' visual processing ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' stimulus processing ', ' retinal neuron ', ' Cone ', ' multielectrode arrays ', ' multi-electrode arrays ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Rod ', ' ']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,528815,0.14568195230211556
"Vision in Natural Tasks Summary/Abstract  In the context of natural behavior, humans make continuous sequences of sensory-motor decisions to satisfy current behavioral goals, and vision must provide the information needed to achieve those goals. The proposed work examines gaze and walking decisions in locomotion in outdoor environments, taking advantage of our novel system for measuring combined eye and body movements in these contexts. Currently we have only limited understanding of the constituent tasks in natural locomotion, or the requisite information, and the proposal attempts to specify these.  in the context of natural gait, the patterns of optic flow are unexpectedly complex, raising questions about its role. The patterns of motion on the retina during locomotion depend critically on both eye and body motion, and these in turn depend on behavioral goals. Our first Aim is therefore to comprehensively describe the statistics of retinal motion patterns in a variety of terrains and task contexts. We will measure binocular eye and body movements while walking in outdoor terrains of varying roughness, crossing a busy intersection, and making coffee. These contexts will induce different gaze patterns. We will provide a comprehensive description of the motion stimulus in natural locomotion and help separate out self-motion signals from externally generated motion. These data will allow a more precise specification of the response patterns in cortical motion sensitive areas. Because of the complexity of natural motion patterns, we will re-examine the influence of optic flow on walking direction in a virtual reality environment and test alternative explanations for the role of flow.  A central task in walking is foot placement, and we will focus on identifying the image properties that make a good foothold. Stereo, structure from motion, and spatial image structure are all likely contenders. We directly investigate the role of stereo in foothold selection by examining gait patterns in stereo-deficient subjects in terrains with varying degrees of roughness. Using a different strategy, we will attempt to predict gaze locations and footholds in rough terrain using convolution neural nets (CNN’s) to identify potential search templates for footholds in rough terrain. We will describe fixation patterns from crosswalk and sidewalk navigation and attempt to make inferences about their purpose, and use Modular Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MIRL) to predict direction decisions and decompose the behavior into sub-tasks.  The collection of integrated gaze, body kinematics, and scene images in a range of natural environments is innovative, as little comparable data exists The work will be strengthened by the investigation of stereo- deficient subjects for whom there is almost no integrated eye and body data. Since much of the work in robotics has no visual input at all this should help in development of visual guidance for robots and also help better define the necessary information for individuals with impaired vision. The data set will be made publicly available. Project Narrative  The central goal of this work is to understand vision in its natural context.

"Auditory brain-computer interface for communication Project Summary  A fundamental end-goal of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) is to enable communication in individuals with severe motor paralysis. BCIs decode the neural signals and accomplish the intended goal via an effector, such as a computer cursor or a robotic limb. The BCI user relies on the realtime feedback of the effector's performance to modulate their neural strategy to control the external device. To date, this feedback is predominantly visual. However patients with the most severe paralysis resulting from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), some forms of stroke and traumatic brain injuries can have severe visual impairments including oculomotor fatigue, nystagmus and ophthalmoparesis - that make the reliable use of a visual-based BCI impossible. This puts a premium on developing novel solutions that can leverage sensory modalities that are intact. In this research, I will develop and test the feasibility of an auditory-based interface to establish BCI control in motor-impaired patients with severe neurological insults  In Aim 1, I propose to implement a novel paradigm using auditory cues in lieu of visual signals, and test its feasibility in controlling an effector (ie, computer cursor) to perform a cued target-acquisition task in healthy participants. This will validate the range of parameter values of the four tested auditory input signals: 1) frequency, 2) amplitude, 3) spatial azimuth and 4) spatial elevation. This approach is distinct from most binary class auditory BCI solutions, since it relies on both the natural ability of humans to localize sounds, and the ability to associate new tones to a virtual space, thus allowing a truly multi-class auditory approach. In Aim 2, I propose to implement the auditory interface into the realtime xPC used for visual presentation in clinical trial participants with intracortical BCIs, and test their performance on the cued target-acquisition task. Although much success has been demonstrated in this task using visual feedback, this auditory approach will permit BCI use by people with visual impairments further compounding their paralysis. Finally in Aim 3, I will test the feasibility of BrainGate BCI users to utilize an auditory BCI speller to perform a copy-typing task and free- typing task.  The accomplishment of the goals of this research will be a critical step towards enabling severely paralyzed individuals with visual impairments to re-establish communication independently, continuously and reliably. Project Narrative Brain-computer interfaces enable motor-impaired individuals to communicate using an effector such as a neural cursor or a robotic arm. The successful completion of the proposed project will develop a unique technology that enables a real-time auditory-reliant BCI for communication in severely paralyzed individuals resulting from stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and severe brain injuries.

"Investigating how mechanical connectivity yields developmental robustness ABSTRACT  It is essential for the fate of an organism that key morphogenetic processes occur reproducibly even under tissue damage or environmental perturbations. While much is known about how genetic redundancy and regulation achieves robust development, less is understood about how a tissue mechanically ensures reproducible shape change when perturbed. This project uncovers how populations of physically interacting cells mechanically respond to challenging conditions and modify their collective behavior to still sculpt the correct final shape.  One way for cells to coordinate tissue-scale forces and movements is through direct mechanical connections. In fact, many developing tissues exhibit supracellular networks of actomyosin connections that link hundreds of cells. A large roadblock has been with the challenges of imaging and quantifying subcellular protein at the tissue scale. I adapted a topological smoothing algorithm originally used to trace high-noise filamentous structure of galaxies in the Universe to data to trace high-noise filamentous myosin structure in confocal images. This allowed for the first quantification of a supracellular myosin network across an entire tissue over developmental time. Subsequent analysis adopting techniques from network theory allowed me to identify that the robust folding of the Drosophila fruit fly embryo during ventral furrow formation is mechanically ensured by patterns in the supracellular network spanning its ventral cells.  This newly discovered importance of supracellular networks in coordinating robust shape change highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of how supracellular networks form, and how their patterns impact the function and robustness of a population of cells. Deciphering robustness at the tissue-level, where the displacement and fate of hundreds of cells must be considered, requires techniques at the interface of cell and developmental biology, biophysics and computer science. The proposed project will take a highly interdisciplinary approach to identify how supracellular network patterns are controlled molecularly, at the cell level, and via tissue constraints. As well, how heterogeneity in tissue-level patterns impacts morphogenetic robustness will be addressed. Together this comprehensive study of the structure and function of supracellular networks will represent a new way to interpret mechanical robustness across diverse developing tissues. As well, a generalized description of mechanical robustness has the potential to uncover new paths to predict and control tissue malformation, which would represent a significant advance for both developmental biology and fetal medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE The robust establishment of correct shape is essential for proper tissue function. Tissue shape change is a mechanical process that necessitates the coordinated force generation and motion of thousands of cells. Identifying how physically interacting cells mechanically respond to challenging conditions and modify their behavior to still sculpt the correct final shape will shed light onto many congenital disorders that result from morphogenetic dysregulation.",Investigating how mechanical connectivity yields developmental robustness,9950519,K99GM136915,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' Actomyosin ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Biophysics ', ' biophysical foundation ', ' biophysical principles ', ' biophysical sciences ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Developmental Biology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drosophila genus ', ' Drosophila ', ' fruit fly ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Engineering ', ' Exhibits ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Motion ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Myosin ATPase ', ' Actin-Activated ATPase ', ' Myosin Adenosine Triphosphatase ', ' Myosin Adenosinetriphosphatase ', ' Myosins ', ' Neural Tube Defects ', ' Neural Tube Developmental Defects ', ' Noise ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Proteins ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' congenital cardiac abnormality ', ' congenital cardiac disease ', ' congenital cardiac disorder ', ' congenital cardiac malformation ', ' congenital heart abnormality ', ' congenital heart anomaly ', ' congenital heart disease ', ' congenital heart malformation ', ' congenital heart disorder ', ' Cell Size ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Stimulus ', ' Congenital Disorders ', ' Galaxy ', ' Genetic ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' Adopted ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' fetal ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' cohesion ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Flies ', ' fly ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Population ', ' malformation ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' fetal medicine ', ' optogenetics ', ' mechanical properties ', ' mechanical force ', ' Maternal-fetal medicine ', ' confocal imaging ', ' tissue-level behavior ', ' ']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2020,98836,0.05711788656208812
"Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma This project will use a combination of structural and functional measurements to test the hypothesis that early- stage damage in human glaucoma occurs first in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina – especially its OFF sub-lamina – as suggested by murine glaucoma models. In the first Aim, we will use a novel visible-light optical coherence tomograph (VIS OCT) to study structural changes in the retina of glaucoma patients. The newly developed VIS OCT has sufficient image contrast and resolution to segment the IPL boundaries and to define sub-lamination in volumetric OCT data, something not currently possible with existing near-infrared OCT instruments. We will make comparative measurements within the IPL and between the IPL, the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Because data from mouse models of glaucoma suggests that early damage occurs preferentially within the OFF sub-lamina of the IPL, we will make separate VIS OCT measurements biased for the OFF- and ON-sublaminae of the IPL and use machine learning approaches to determine whether a similar damage process can be demonstrated in human. To test whether OFF-pathway function is preferentially lost in glaucoma, we will use a novel Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) paradigm that employs sawtooth increments and decrements to bias the measurement to ON vs OFF pathways, respectively, a paradigm our data suggests discriminates glaucoma from control patients. The second Aim will optimize this SSVEP measurement for testing localized areas of the visual field. The third Aim will make comparative measurements of visual-field, VIS OCT and SSVEP loss patterns in a large sample of glaucoma patients and in age- and sex-matched controls. Thickness and interface reflectivity amplitude maps derived from VIS OCT imaging of the RNFL, GCL and IPL including sublaminae will be correlated topographically with visual field defects to assess the relative sensitivity of our structural biomarkers at and near visual field locations with demonstrable losses on conventional (Humphrey) perimetry. Similarly, SSVEP responses from different locations in the visual field will be correlated topographically with visual field loss patterns and to VIS OCT losses, with special emphasis on correlating structural damage in OFF vs ON sub-laminae of the IPL with the functional correlates derived from regional decremental and incremental SSVEPs. Separately and in combination, our structural and functional measurements are designed to provide strong tests of the biological hypothesis that the OFF pathway is preferentially damaged in human glaucoma, and to reveal new biomarkers for the disease. Improving visual outcomes in glaucoma will require a better understanding of the earliest sites and processes of damage and methods to measure them quickly and accurately in patients. This project will address both needs through a combination of novel Optical Coherence Tomography and electrophysiological measurements. The new imaging and electrophysiological tests that will be developed here, either separately or together, could eventually replace conventional visual field testing which is time-consuming and unreliable.",Structural and functional tests of ganglion cell damage in glaucoma,9913546,R01EY030361,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Elements ', ' Visual evoked cortical potential ', ' Visual Evoked Potentials ', ' Visual Evoked Response ', ' Glaucoma ', ' glaucomatous ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Noise ', ' optic nerve disorder ', ' Cranial Nerve II Diseases ', ' Cranial Nerve II Disorder ', ' Neural-Optical Lesion ', ' Optic Nerve Diseases ', ' Optic Neuropathy ', ' Second Cranial Nerve Diseases ', ' second cranial nerve disorder ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Patients ', ' Perimetry ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Scotoma ', ' Visual Field Disorder ', ' Visual field scotoma ', ' visual field defect ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' gangliocyte ', ' ganglion cell ', ' Visual ', ' Visible Light ', ' Visible Light Radiation ', ' Visible Radiation ', ' Measurement ', ' Atrophy ', ' Atrophic ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Cellular injury ', ' cell damage ', ' cellular damage ', ' damage to cells ', ' injury to cells ', ' cell injury ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Doppler OCT ', ' OCT Tomography ', ' optical Doppler tomography ', ' optical coherence Doppler tomography ', ' Optical Coherence Tomography ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Inner Plexiform Layer ', ' Resolution ', ' Ganglion Cell Layer ', ' Rodent Model ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Modification ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Consumption ', ' extrastriate area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' visual area ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' comparative ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' RNFL ', ' retinal nerve fiber layer ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Structural malformation ', ' structural abnormalities ', ' structural anomalies ', ' Structural defect ', ' contrast imaging ', ' retina imaging ', ' retinal imaging ', ' ']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,521102,0.20327960834286568
"Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches Project Summary The form (or shape) and function relationship of anatomical structures is a central theme in biology where abnor- mal shape changes are closely tied to pathological functions. Morphometrics has been an indispensable quan- titative tool in medical and biological sciences to study anatomical forms for more than 100 years. Recently, the increased availability of high-resolution in-vivo images of anatomy has led to the development of a new generation of morphometric approaches, called statistical shape modeling (SSM), that take advantage of modern computa- tional techniques to model anatomical shapes and their variability within populations with unprecedented detail. SSM stands to revolutionize morphometric analysis, but its widespread adoption is hindered by a number of sig- niﬁcant challenges, including the complexity of the approaches and their increased computational requirements, relative to traditional morphometrics. Arguably, however, the most important roadblock to more widespread adop- tion is the lack of user-friendly and scalable software tools for a variety of anatomical surfaces that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research labs. The goal of this proposal is thus to address these challenges in the context of a ﬂexible and general SSM approach termed particle-based shape modeling (PSM), which automat- ically constructs optimal statistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes without relying on any speciﬁc surface parameterization. The proposed research will provide an automated, general- purpose, and scalable computational solution for constructing shape models of general anatomy. In Aim 1, we will build computational and machine learning algorithms to model anatomies with complex surface topologies (e.g., surface openings and shared boundaries) and highly variable anatomical populations. In Aim 2, we will introduce an end-to-end machine learning approach to extract statistical shape representation directly from im- ages, requiring no parameter tuning, image pre-processing, or user assistance. In Aim 3, we will provide intuitive graphical user interfaces and visualization tools to incorporate user-deﬁned modeling preferences and promote the visual interpretation of shape models. We will also make use of recent advances in cloud computing to enable researchers with limited computational resources and/or large cohorts to build and execute custom SSM work- ﬂows using remote scalable computational resources. Algorithmic developments will be thoroughly evaluated and validated using existing, fully funded, large-scale, and constantly growing databases of CT and MRI images lo- cated on-site. Furthermore, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc use cases for complex anatomies to promote reproducibility. Efforts to develop the proposed technology are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), and its third strategic goal: to bridge biology and quantitative science for better global health through supporting the development of and access to computational research tools for biomedical research. Our long-term goal is to increase the clinical utility and widespread adoption of SSM, and the proposed research will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative This project will develop general-purpose, scalable, and open-source statistical shape modeling (SSM) tools, which will present unique capabilities for automated anatomy modeling with less user input. The proposed tech- nology will introduce a number of signiﬁcant improvements to current SSM approaches and tools, including the support for challenging modeling problems, inferring shapes directly from images (and hence bypassing the seg- mentation step), parallel optimizations for speed, and new user interfaces that will be much easier and scalable than the current tools. The proposed technology will constitute an indispensable resource for the biomedical and clinical communities that will enable new avenues for biomedical research and clinical investigations, provide new ways to answer biologically related questions, allow new types of questions to be asked, and open the door for the integration of SSM with clinical care.","Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches",9969467,R01AR076120,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cardiology ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Feline Species ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Ice ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Learning ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Mathematical Computing ', ' Math Computing ', ' Mathematic Computing ', ' Medicine ', ' Mission ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Morphogenesis ', ' morphogenetic process ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Science ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Specialist ', ' Custom ', ' Imagery ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' biomedical resource ', ' image processing ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Visual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' Structure ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' model development ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' NIGMS ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Anatomic Surface ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Pathologic ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Image data archive ', ' image archive ', ' image library ', ' picture archive ', ' image archival system ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' software user interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' usability ', ' clinical care ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Geometry ', ' Complex Analysis ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' clinical investigation ', ' deep learning ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' algorithm development ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,614363,0.10088512645234934
"Human Face Representation in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks The human visual system can recognize a familiar face across wide variations of viewpoint, illumination, expression, and appearance. This remarkable computational feat is accomplished by large-­scale networks of neurons. We will test a face space theory of the representations that emerge at the top layer of deep learning convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as a model of human visual representations of faces. Computer-based face recognition has improved in recent years due to DCNNs and the easy availability of labeled training data (faces and identities) from the web. Inspired by the primate visual system, DCNNs are feed­forward artificial neural networks that can map images of faces into representations that support recognition over widely variable images. Although the calculations executed by the simulated neurons are simple, enormous numbers of computations are used to convert an image into a representation. The end result of this processing is a highly compact representation of a face that retains image detail in an invariant, identity­-specific face code. This code is fundamentally different than any representation of faces considered in vision science. This theory we test combines key components of previous face space models (similarity, learning history) with new features (imaging conditions, personal face history) in a unitary space that represents both identity and facial appearance across variable images. We will test whether this model can account for human recognition of familiar faces, which is highly robust to image variability (pose, illumination, expression). The model will also be applied to understanding long standing difficulties humans (and machines) have with faces of other races. We aim to bridge critical gaps in our knowledge of how DCNNs work, linking psychological, neural, and computational perspectives. A fundamentally new theory of face representation will alter the questions we ask about face representations in all three fields. A new focus on understanding how we (or neural networks) “perceive” a single familiar identity in widely variable images will give rise to a search for representations that gracefully merge the properties of faces with the real-­world image conditions in which they are experienced. This project presents a unique opportunity to study, manipulate, and learn from these representations, and to apply the findings to broader questions about high-­level vision from neural and perceptual perspectives. Human recognition of familiar faces is highly robust to image variability (pose, illumination, expression)—a skill that is likely due to the quality and quantity of experience we have with the faces of people we know well. Deep convolutional neural networks are modeled after the primate visual system and have made impressive gains recently on the problem of robust face recognition. Understanding the visual nature of the face “feature” codes that emerge in these networks can give insight into long-standing questions about how the human visual system can, but does not always, represent a face in a way that generalizes across images that vary widely.",Human Face Representation in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,9873959,R01EY029692,"['Affect ', ' Computers ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Learning ', ' Lighting ', ' Illumination ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Primates ', ' Primates Mammals ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Published Comment ', ' Space Models ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Familiarity ', ' skills ', ' Categories ', ' Appearance ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Data ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' facial processing ', ' Face Processing ', ' visual science ', ' vision science ', ' representation theory ', ' model of human ', ' human model ', ' feedforward neural network ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' artificial neural network ', ' deep learning ', ' neural network ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS DALLAS,R01,2020,385203,0.10148355828042986
"Virtual prototyping for retinal prosthesis patients Project Summary/Abstract Retinal dystrophies such as retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration induce progressive loss of photoreceptors, resulting in profound visual impairment in more than ten million people worldwide. Visual neuroprostheses (‘bionic eyes’) aim to restore functional vision by electrically stimulating remaining cells in the retina, analogous to cochlear implants. A wide variety of neuroprostheses are either in development (e.g. optogenetics, cortical) or are being implanted in patients (e.g. subretinal or epiretinal electrical). A limiting factor that affects all device types are perceptual distortions and subsequent loss of information, caused by interactions between the implant technology and the underlying neurophysiology. Understanding the causes of these distortions and finding ways to alleviate them is critically important to the success of current and future sight restoration technologies. In this proposal, human visual psychophysics, computational modeling, data-driven approaches, and virtual reality (VR) will be combined to develop and experimentally validate optimized stimulation protocols for epiretinal prostheses. This approach is analogous to virtual prototyping for airplanes and other complex systems: to use a high-quality model of both the implant electronics and the visual system in order to generate a ‘virtual patient’. Retinal electrophysiological and visual behavioral data will be used to develop and validate a computational model of the expected visual experience of patients when electrically stimulated. One way of using this model will be to generate simulations of the expected perceptual outcome of electrical stimulation across a wide variety of electrical stimulation patterns. These will be used as a training set for machine learning algorithms that will invert the input-output function of the model to find the electrical stimulation protocol that best replicates any desired perceptual experience. The model can also be used to simulate the expected perceptual experience of real patients by using sighted subjects in a VR environment – ‘VR virtual patients’. These virtual patients will be used to discover preprocessing methods (e.g., edge enhancement, retargeting, decluttering) that improve behavioral performance in VR. Although current retinal prostheses have been implanted in over 250 patients worldwide, experimentation with improved stimulation protocols remains challenging and expensive. Implementing ‘virtual patients’ in VR offers an affordable and practical alternative for high-throughput experiments to test new stimulation protocols. Stimulation protocols that result in good VR performance will be experimentally validated in real prosthesis patients in collaboration with Second Sight Medical Products Inc. and Pixium Vision, two leading device manufacturers in the field. This work has the potential to significantly improve the effectiveness of visual neuroprostheses as a treatment option for individuals suffering from blinding retinal diseases. Project Narrative Inadequate stimulation paradigms are currently one of the main factors limiting the effectiveness of visual prostheses as a treatment option for individuals suffering from blinding retinal diseases. My goal is to develop and validate novel stimulation protocols for visual prosthesis patients that minimize perceptual distortions and thereby improve behavioral performance.

"Access to parietal action representations after stroke lesions in visual cortex PROJECT SUMMARY  The ability to recognize and use objects according to their function (e.g., fork, hammer, pencil) requires integration of visual, semantic and action knowledge across occipital, temporal and parietal areas. Left parietal regions support critical aspects of object-directed action, such as grasping and object manipulation. This research activity uses a combination of fMRI and behavioral measures in patients with ischemic strokes to early and extrastriate visual areas to test the following hypotheses: Aim 1: There is a visual pathway to the parietal grasp region (aIPS) that bypasses processing in primary visual cortex. Aim 2: Left ventral extrastriate cortex is necessary to access manipulation information for visually presented objects. Aim 3A: Ballistic grasping actions to objects in the hemianopic field are influenced by volumetric properties (size, orientation) of targets. Aim 3B: Left ventral extrastriate lesions impair object function (e.g., `scissors used to cut') and disrupt access to manipulation knowledge from visual input. The research leverages strengths of fMRI (whole brain correlational measure) and neuropsychology (causal inference) to test new hypotheses about vision and action.  `Tools' (i.e., small manipulable objects) are an excellent domain in which to address broader questions about the integration of sensory, motor and cognitive processing. This is because tool recognition and tool use require the integration of distinct sensory, motor and cognitive representations, and the neural substrates of tool processing are well described. The research program emphasizes fresh perspectives on longstanding ideas about the dorsal and ventral visual pathways, by a) undertaking the first systematic investigation of the types of information about objects that are extracted by visual pathways that bypass primary visual cortex, and by b) studying how some parietal areas depend on inputs from the ventral stream in order to access the correct action for a given object. The research activity innovates by testing hypotheses about how lesions at different stages in the cortical visual hierarchy affect downstream processing in parietal cortex, combining neural and behavioral measures to study brain damaged patients (generating causal evidence), and by combining univariate and multivariate measures to `read out' the information content of brain regions (parietal cortex) that are anatomically remote from a lesion. The research advances understanding of how lesions in one brain region disrupt computations in other parts of the brain that depend on the damaged region for their inputs, a phenomenon (`dynamic diaschisis') that applies to brain injury generally. Advancing understanding of these basic issues using causal data has broad implications for understanding how the brain selects the correct action for the correct object, and more generally for theories of conceptual organization and causal reasoning. Understanding how the brain accesses actions from visual input has implications for related fields, such as robotics, neuroprosthetics, and evidenced based approaches for rehabilitating function after brain injury. Project Narrative Functional MRI and behavioral testing are used to test hypotheses about how strokes affecting occipital and temporal cortex disrupt access to action representations in parietal cortex. This research will advance understanding of how the brain processes visual information in support of everyday actions.",Access to parietal action representations after stroke lesions in visual cortex,9868307,R01EY028535,"['Affect ', ' Alexia ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' fovea centralis ', ' Fovea ', ' Goals ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Occipital lobe ', ' occipital cortex ', ' Parietal Lobe ', ' parietal cortex ', ' Patients ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Robotics ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Visual Fields ', ' eye field ', ' Visual Pathways ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Dorsal ', ' Area ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' Lesion ', ' Supramarginal Gyrus ', ' Structure of supramarginal gyrus ', ' Gyrus Hippocampi ', ' Gyrus Parahippocampalis ', ' Hippocampal Gyrus ', ' Parahippocampal Gyrus ', ' Stimulus ', ' Agnosia for Faces ', ' Facial Recognition Agnosia ', ' Prosopagnosia ', ' Visual ', ' Research Activity ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Parietal ', ' Stream ', ' Sensory ', ' Location ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' visual processing ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neuro-prosthetic ', ' neuroprosthetic ', ' neuroprosthesis ', ' sensory integration ', ' Participant ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Bypass ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Ballistics ', ' Brain region ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' after stroke ', ' poststroke ', ' post stroke ', ' Behavioral Assay ', ' blind ', ' visuomotor ', ' visual motor ', ' Population ', ' extrastriate ', ' extrastriate area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' visual area ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' visual object processing ', ' visual information ', ' visual process ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' information processing ', ' evidence base ', ' multisensory ', ' cognitive development ', ' Grain ', ' ']",NEI,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,423007,0.12412356095760185
"Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex The mammalian visual cortex is critical for vision and has been used as a model for the rest of the cerebral cortex. In spite of this, little is known about the detailed operations of its microcircuits. In fact, the cortex is composed of many different cell types, and, it is likely that each cell type has a particular circuit function.  In the past cycle we focused on four major subtypes of cortical GABAergic interneurons (PV, SOM, VIP and chandeliers) in mouse visual cortex, using two- photon photoactivation and transgenic mice to map connections to and from interneurons in a systematic fashion. We found that interneurons often make synaptic connections with every single neighboring cell, and this promiscuity could be an important feature of the cortical inhibitory “circuit blueprint”.  In the course of these experiments we unexpectedly discovered that groups of coactive neurons, which we termed “neuronal ensembles”, account for the majority of the cortical response to visual stimuli. Moreover, ensembles also dominate spontaneous activity and have distinct spatiotemporal characteristics. Further, using two-photon optogenetics we found by chance that ensembles can be artificially imprinted into the cortex and they can be recalled by stimulating individual neurons, showing pattern completion, even days after imprinting. These intriguing results suggest that ensembles could be multicellular building blocks of cortical function, implementing a population neural code.  To pursue this discovery and test these ideas we now propose an experimental “deep dive” into the properties of these ensembles, in order to characterize their basic phenomenology, understand their synaptic circuit mechanisms and test their role in the behavior of the animal in sensory discrimination. The project will be carried out in primary visual cortex of awake behaving mice and make use of a novel two-photon holographic microscopy method that enables us to image and optically manipulate neurons in different cortical layers simultaneously.  Our work will provide a systematic anatomical and functional description of neuronal ensembles, how they regulate the activity of the cortex and how they can be manipulated and reconfigured. This could help in novel therapeutic strategies by reconfiguring pathological circuits and correct visual deficits. Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex The role of coordinated neuronal activity by groups of neurons in the visual cortex is still poorly understood. In the last cycle of the grant we discovered that one can reconfigure cortical activity in mouse visual cortex using optogenetics, by imprinting and recalling artificial activity patterns, and we now propose to understand how these patterns are build and whether their manipulation can lead to changes in behavior. This work could help to understand how neural circuits in the visual cortex operate and can be altered and also help to design novel strategies to ameliorate amblyopia and cortical cerebral visual impairment by reconfiguring abnormal circuits.  ",Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex,9912748,R01EY011787,"['Amblyopia ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Animal Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cerebral cortex ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' In Vitro ', ' Premature Infant ', ' infants born premature ', ' infants born prematurely ', ' premature baby ', ' premature infant human ', ' preterm baby ', ' preterm infant ', ' preterm infant human ', ' nerve supply ', ' innervation ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Microscopy ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' homotypical cortex ', ' isocortex ', ' neopallium ', ' Neocortex ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Morphology ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' photoactivation ', ' sensory discrimination ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' 3-D Imaging ', ' 3D imaging ', ' Three-Dimensional Imaging ', ' in vivo ', ' Optical Methods ', ' Slice ', ' Pathologic ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' 2-photon ', ' two-photon ', ' excitatory neuron ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Perceptual learning ', ' Population ', ' Synaptic plasticity ', ' imprint ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' developmental plasticity ', ' operation ', ' optogenetics ', ' phenomenology ', ' phenomenological models ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' neural network ', ' mouse genetics ', ' cerebral visual impairment ', ' cortical visual impairment ', ' ']",NEI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2020,395525,0.08348849515455868
"Shared and specific mechanisms of auditory and visual category learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ability to learn new perceptual categories enables some of the most complex human behaviors, from speech perception to visual object recognition. Current understanding of the mechanisms involved in perceptual category learning relies on the fundamental assumption that the processes underlying such learning are shared across the senses. However, the vast majority of this work has focused on the visual modality. As a consequence, the research regarding how humans learn to group complex auditory information into categories has relied greatly on conclusions from the research in the visual domain without testing this critical assumption. However, recent evidence from the attention literature suggests that even seemingly domain-general cognitive processes, such as working memory, are accomplished via sensory-biased regions in frontal cortex. The current investigation will directly compare the computational and neural mechanisms supporting auditory and visual category learning by training the same individuals on categories in both modalities while in an fMRI scanner. Aim #1 of this investigation will identify the shared and sensory-biased circuits supporting feedback processing during auditory and visual category learning. If the neural circuits supporting perceptual category learning are shared across the modalities, it is expected that similar regions will be recruited to a similar extent during feedback processing. If instead, the neural circuits are distinct for particular modalities, it is expected that sensory-biased regions will emerge as supporting category learning for auditory and visual modalities. Aim #2 will utilize advanced machine learning techniques (multivariate pattern classification and representational similarity analyses) to characterize the emergence of category-level neural representations over the course of learning. Aim #3 will identify the functional and structural connectivity of the circuits as they contribute to perceptual category learning. The proposed research will directly test the fundamental assumption about the nature of this complex problem that affects everyday behaviors. This research has the potential to impact understanding of cases where modality- specific learning abilities might be impaired, such as phonetic learning and language-related impairments in dyslexia, autism, and specific language impairment. The proposed research will provide the training foundation to support the PI’s long-term objective of developing theories of perceptual category learning that are constrained by neurobiology and behavior and will specify the behavioral, computational, and neural mechanisms of such learning. This project presents the opportunity to directly test a critical assumption underlying understanding of perceptual category learning. The proposed research will take place in an exceptional training environment and the PI will be mentored by a team of knowledgeable and accomplished scientists. The research will provide the PI with training in functional magnetic resonance experiment design and analysis which will prepare her well for a career as an independent scientist in computational cognitive neuroscience. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will contribute to fundamental knowledge about how seemingly general-purpose cognitive systems may demonstrate modality specificity. The goal of this investigation is to characterize the differences in cognitive processing during category learning when the information comes from the auditory or visual modalities.

"CRCNS: Probabilistic models of perceptual grouping/segmentation in natural vision   To understand and navigate the environment, sensory systems must solve simultaneously two competing and challenging tasks: the segmentation of a sensory scene into individual objects and the grouping of elementary sensory features to build these objects. Understanding perceptual grouping and segmentation is therefore a major goal of sensory neuroscience, and it is central to advancing artificial perceptual systems that can help restore impaired vision. To make progress in understanding image segmentation and improving algorithms, this project combines two key components. First, a new experimental paradigm that allows for well-controlled measurements of perceptual segmentation of natural images. This addresses a major limitation of existing data that are either restricted to artificial stimuli, or, for natural images, rely on manual labeling and conflate perceptual, motor, and cognitive factors. Second, this project involves developing and testing a computational framework that accommodates bottom-up information about image statistics and top-down information about objects and behavioral goals. This is in contrast with the paradigmatic view of visual processing as a feedforward cascade of feature detectors, that has long dominated computer vision algorithms and our understanding of visual processing. The proposed approach builds instead on the influential theory that perception requires probabilistic inference to extract meaning from ambiguous sensory inputs. Segmentation is a prime example of inference on ambiguous inputs: the pixels of an image often cannot be labeled with certainty as grouped or segmented. This project will test the hypothesis that human visual segmentation is a process of hierarchical probabilistic inference. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether the measured variability of human segmentations reflects the uncertainty predicted by the model, as required for well-calibrated probabilistic inference. Specific Aim 2 addresses how feedforward and feedback processing in human segmentation contribute to efficient integration of visual features across different levels of complexity, from small contours to object parts. Specific Aim 3 will determine reciprocal interactions between perceptual segmentation and top-down influences including: semantic scene content; visual texture discrimination; and expectations reflecting environmental statistics. The proposed approach models these influences as Bayesian priors, and thus, if supported by the proposed experiments, will offer a unified framework to understand the integration of bottom-up and top- down influences in human segmentation of natural inputs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project aims to provide a unified understanding of perceptual segmentation and grouping of visual inputs encountered in the natural environment, through correct integration of the information contained in the visual inputs with top-down information about objects and behavioral goals. This understanding is central to advancing artificial perceptual systems that can help restore impaired vision in patient populations.

"ShapeWorks in the Cloud Project Summary This application is submitted in response to NOT-OD-20-073 as an administrative supplement to the parent award R01AR076120 titled: ""Anatomy Directly from Imagery: General-purpose, Scalable, and Open-source Machine Learning Approaches."" The form (or shape) of anatomies is the clinical language that describes abnormal mor- phologies tied to pathologic functions. Quantifying such subtle morphological shape changes requires parsing the anatomy into a quantitative description that is consistent across the population in question. For more than 100 years, morphometrics has been an indispensable quantitative tool in medical and biological sciences to study anatomical forms. But its representation capacity is limited to linear distances, angles, and areas. Sta- tistical shape modeling (SSM) is the computational extension of classical morphometric techniques to analyze more detailed representations of complex anatomy and their variability within populations The parent award ad- dresses existing roadblocks for the widespread adoption of SSM computational tools in the context of a ﬂexible and general SSM approach termed particle-based shape modeling (PSM) and its associated suite of open-source software tools, ShapeWorks. ShapeWorks enables learning population-level shape representation via automatic dense placement of homologous landmarks on image segmentations of general anatomy with arbitrary topology. The utility of ShapeWorks has been demonstrated in a range of biomedical applications. ShapeWorks has the potential to transform the way researchers approach studies of anatomical forms, but its widespread applicability and impact to medicine and biology are hindered by computational barriers that most existing shape modeling packages face. The goal of this supplement award is to provide supplemental support for Aim 3 of the parent award to leverage best practices in software development and advances in cloud computing to enable researchers with limited computational resources and/or large-scale cohorts to build and execute custom SSM workﬂows us- ing remote scalable computational resources. To achieve this goal, we have developed a plan to enhance the design, implementation, and cloud-readiness of ShapeWorks and augmented our scientiﬁc team to add senior, experienced software engineers/developers who have extensive experience in professional programming, code refactoring, and scientiﬁc computing. This award will provide our team with the support necessary to (Aim 1) de- sign ShapeWorks as a collection of modular and reusable services, (Aim 2) decouple ShapeWorks services from explicitly encoded data sources, and (Aim 3) refactor ShapeWorks to scale efﬁciently on the cloud. All software development will be performed in adherence to software engineering practices and design principles, including coding style, documentation, and version control. The proposed efforts will be released as open-source software in a manner consistent with the principles of reproducible research and the practices of open science. Our long- term goal is to make ShapeWorks a standard tool for shape analyses in medicine, and the work proposed herein in addition to the parent award will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative ShapeWorks is a free, open-source software tool that uses a ﬂexible method for automated construction of sta- tistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes. The impact and scientiﬁc value of ShapeWorks have been recognized in a range of applications, including psychology, biological phenotyping, car- diology, and orthopedics. If funded, this supplement will provide support to revise, refactor, and redeploy Shape- Works to take advantage of new cloud computing paradigms, to be robust, sustainable, scalable, and accessible to a broader community, and to address the growing need for shape modeling tools to handle large collections of clinical data and to obtain sufﬁcient statistical power for large shape studies.",ShapeWorks in the Cloud,10166337,R01AR076120,"['Adoption ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Award ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Cardiology ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Parents ', ' Phenotype ', ' Privatization ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Running ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Design ', ' Designing computer software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Custom ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Documentation ', ' model development ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Pathologic ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Source Code ', ' shape description ', ' shape analysis ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' scientific computing ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Cloud Infrastructure ', ' cloud computer ', ' Cloud Computing ', ' Complex Analysis ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' open data ', ' Cloud Service ', ' computing platform ', ' computational platform ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' large data sets ', ' large datasets ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,210000,0.07265299482322274
"Guiding Attention in Real-World Scenes Project Summary Real-world scenes contain far more information than we can perceive at any given moment. Scene perception therefore requires attentional selection of relevant scene regions for prioritized processing. How are those aspects of the world that should receive priority selected? Although much past research has focused on how attention is guided by the visual properties of a scene, new evidence from meaning maps, developed in the previous funding period, established that the distribution of meaning across a scene plays a central and often dominant role in guiding attention. This surprising finding raises many important new questions about the nature of scene meaning and its specific role in attentional guidance. The overarching goal of this project is to understand in detail how the semantic features of a scene’s objects and functional spaces influence the guidance of visual attention in complex real-world scenes. The specific aims are: (1) To determine the role of object semantics in attentional guidance in scenes; (2) To determine the role of functional spaces in attentional guidance in scenes; (3) To determine how viewing task interacts with scene semantics in guiding attention. The project is innovative in expanding the traditional study of attention to explicitly consider the role of meaning. To this end, new semantic maps capitalizing on the meaning map concept will be used capture local region meaning continuously over a scene, allowing for direct investigation of the relationships of different types of meaning with attention. The project is innovative in (1) expanding the traditional study of visual attention to explicitly consider the role of semantics; (2) focusing on the semantics of both scene content (objects) and scene structure (space); (3) considering the role of meaning in attentional guidance in the context of viewing task; (4) integrating the use of a wide variety of cognitive science methods marshalled in the service of understanding the influence of meaning on visual attention in real-world scenes, including eyetracking, large-scale crowd-sourcing, computational image processing, computational semantic modeling, and deep convolutional neural networks. The project is significant in challenging current models of visual attention to account for the role of scene meaning. Because the proposed studies test competing models, the results will lead to the development of integrative theoretical frameworks that advance the field regardless of the outcome. While focused on basic science, the studies have potentially important translational implications by providing a more complete characterization of the processes associated with visual attention. The proposed studies may ultimately lead to the development of rehabilitation strategies for visual attention as it operates in the real world, better capitalizing on the use of a viewer’s knowledge to offset disrupted functions in those with attention and vision deficits. Project Narrative The visual world presents us with far more information than we can process at any given moment. How does the brain select those aspects of the world that should receive priority for visual analysis? This project investigates how we select and attend to meaningful information the natural environment given what we are currently trying to accomplish. The studies combine high-resolution eyetracking with models of meaning based on crowd-sourced human ratings, computer vision models of image processing, deep learning models of scene recognition and attention, and hybrid artificial intelligence models of complex concepts. The role of meaning in guiding attention is contrasted with the role of pre-semantic image features. The knowledge gained will increase our theoretical understanding of how visual attention and perception operate in complex meaningful scenes, assist in the identification of individuals with deficits in visual attention, and may ultimately lead to the development of targeted rehabilitation strategies for the real world.",Guiding Attention in Real-World Scenes,10049970,R01EY027792,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attention ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Computer Vision Systems ', ' computer vision ', ' Environment ', ' Esthetics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Judgment ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Semantics ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Testing ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Perception ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Nature ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Marshal ', ' Services ', ' Visual attention ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' Structure ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' visual search ', ' model development ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' rehab strategy ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' visual information ', ' concept maps ', ' concept mapping ', ' crowd source ', ' crowd-sourcing ', ' crowdsource ', ' crowdsourcing ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' imaging properties ', ' deep learning ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,381403,0.14915795475915072
"Predicting Human Olfactory Perception from Molecular Structure PROJECT SUMMARY Modern technology makes it possible to capture a visual scene as a photograph, alter it, send it to another country nearly instantaneously, and store it without concern for degradation. None of this is currently possible in olfaction. Although perfumers and flavorists are adept at mixing odorous molecules to produce a desired perceptual effect, the rules underlying this process are poorly understood at a quantitative level. Current methods for displaying odors to a subject are akin to requiring a Polaroid of every visual stimulus of interest. A more efficient method for probing the olfactory system would be to use a set of 'primary odors'—some limited number of odors from which all other complex odors could be reproduced by appropriate mixtures. Both auditory and visual stimuli have been digitized, and this will eventually be possible in olfaction as well. Predicting odor from chemical structure has been a problem in the field since its inception, but recent advances in machine learning algorithms have made great progress in analogous problems, such as facial recognition. The research proposed here will combine these machine learning techniques with high quality human psychophysics to understand how to predict the smell of a molecule or mixture of odorants, which will ultimately help improve our understanding of disease diagnosis using odors as well as eating-related health and illness.

"ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis Project Summary The morphology (or shape) of anatomical structures forms the common language among clinicians, where ab- normalities in anatomical shapes are often tied to deleterious function. While these observations are often quali- tative, ﬁnding subtle, quantitative shape effects requires the application of mathematics, statistics, and computing to parse the anatomy into a numerical representation that will facilitate testing of biologically relevant hypotheses. Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) and its associated suite of software tools, ShapeWorks, enable learning population-level shape representation via automatic dense placement of homologous landmarks on image seg- mentations of general anatomy with arbitrary topology. The utility of ShapeWorks has been demonstrated in a range of biomedical applications. Despite its obvious utility for the research enterprise and highly permissive open-source license, ShapeWorks does not have a viable commercialization path due to the inherent trade-off between development and maintenance costs, and a specialized scientiﬁc and clinical market. ShapeWorks has the potential to transform the way researchers approach studies of anatomical forms, but its widespread ap- plicability to medicine and biology is hindered by several barriers that most existing shape modeling packages face. The most important roadblocks are (1) the complexity and steep learning curve of existing shape modeling pipelines and their increased computational and computer memory requirements; (2) the considerable expertise, time, and effort required to segment anatomies of interest for statistical analyses; and (3) the lack of interoperable implementations that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research laboratories. In this project, we pro- pose ShapeWorksStudio, a software suite that leverages ShapeWorks for the automated population-/patient-level modeling of anatomical shapes, and Seg3D – a widely used open-source tool to visualize and process volumet- ric images – for ﬂexible manual/semiautomatic segmentation and interactive manual correction of segmented anatomy. In Aim 1, we will integrate ShapeWorks and Seg3D in a framework that supports big data cohorts to enable users to transparently proceed from image data to shape models in a straightforward manner. In Aim 2, we will endow Seg3D with a machine learning approach that provides automated segmentations within a statisti- cal framework that combines image data with population-speciﬁc shape priors provided by ShapeWorks. In Aim 3, we will support interoperability with existing open-source software packages and toolkits, and provide bindings to commonly used programming languages in the biomedical research community. To promote reproducibility, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc test cases. This project combines an interdisciplinary research and development team with decades of experience in statistical analysis and image understanding, and application scientists to conﬁrm that the proposed developments have a real impact on the biomedical and clinical research communities. Our long-term goal is to make ShapeWorks a standard tool for shape analyses in medicine, and the work proposed herein will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative ShapeWorks is a free, open-source software tool that uses a ﬂexible method for automated construction of sta- tistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes. ShapeWorks has been effective in a range of applications, including psychology, biological phenotyping, cardiology, and orthopedics. If funded, this application will ensure the viability of ShapeWorks in the face of the ever-increasing complexity of shape datasets and support its availability to biomedical researchers in the future, as well as provide opportunities for use in a wide spectrum of new biological and clinical applications, including anatomy reconstruction from sparse/low- dimensional imaging data, large-scale clinical trials, surgical planning, optimal designs of medical implants, and reconstructive surgery.","ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis",10023935,U24EB029011,"['Adoption ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cardiology ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Exhibits ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Manuals ', ' Mathematics ', ' Math ', ' Medicine ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Anatomic Models ', ' Anatomical Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Orthopedics ', ' Orthopedic ', ' Orthopedic Surgical Profession ', ' Phenotype ', ' Programming Languages ', ' Psychology ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' statistics ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Licensing ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Morphology ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Consensus ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' reconstructive surgery ', ' Reconstructive Surgical Procedures ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' particle ', ' cohort ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Normalities ', ' Normalcy ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' medical implant ', ' reconstruction ', ' shape description ', ' shape analysis ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' imaging Segmentation ', ' interoperability ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' usability ', ' commercialization ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Complex Analysis ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' clinical investigation ', ' auto-segmentation ', ' automatic segmentation ', ' autosegmentation ', ' automated segmentation ', ' ']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2020,415556,0.07666769452952026
"Natural image processing in the visual cortex Project Summary Signals from the natural environment are processed by neuronal populations in the cortex. Understanding the relationship between those signals and cortical activity is central to understanding normal cortical function and how it is impaired in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Substantial progress has been made in elucidating cortical processing of simple, parametric stimuli, and computational technology is improving descriptions of neural responses to naturalistic stimuli. However, how cortical populations encode the complex, natural inputs received during every day perceptual experience is largely unknown. This project aims to elucidate how natural visual inputs are represented by neuronal populations in primary visual cortex (V1). Progress to date has been limited primarily by two factors. First, during natural vision, the inputs to V1 neurons are always embedded in a spatial and temporal context, but how V1 integrates this contextual information in natural visual inputs is poorly understood. Second, prior work focused almost exclusively on single-neuron firing rate, but to understand cortical representations one must consider the structure of population activity— the substantial trial-to-trial variability that is shared among neurons and evolves dynamically—as this structure influences population information and perception. The central hypothesis of this project is that cortical response structure is modulated by visual context to approximate an optimal representation of natural visual inputs. To test the hypothesis, this project combines machine learning to quantify the statistical properties of natural visual inputs, with a theory of how cortical populations should encode those images to achieve an optimal representation, to arrive at concrete, falsifiable predictions for V1 response structure. The predictions will be tested with measurements of population activity in V1 of awake monkeys viewing natural images and movies. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether modulation of V1 response structure by spatial context in static images is consistent with optimal encoding of those images, and will compare the predictive power of the proposed model to alternative models. Specific Aim 2 addresses V1 encoding of dynamic natural inputs, and will test whether modulation of V1 activity by temporal context is tuned to the temporal structure of natural sensory signals, as required for optimality. As both spatial and temporal are present simultaneously during natural vision, Specific Aim 3 will determine visual input statistics in free-viewing animals, and test space-time interactions in V1 activity evoked by those inputs. This project will provide the first test of a unified functional theory of contextual modulation in V1 encoding of natural visual inputs, and shed light on key aspects of natural vision that have been neglected to date. Project Narrative This project aims to determine how neurons in the visual cortex represent the inputs encountered during perceptual experience in the natural environment, through correct integration of visual information across space and time. In individuals with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, integration is often miscalibrated leading to perceptual impairments. Our study will advance knowledge of the relationship between natural sensory inputs and cortical activity, which is central to understanding normal cortical function and how it is impaired in patient populations.",Natural image processing in the visual cortex,10018026,R01EY030578,"['Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Macaca ', ' Macaque ', ' Monkeys ', ' Motion ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Perception ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' statistics ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' image processing ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Sensory ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' movie ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' model development ', ' Address ', ' Animal Testing ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' neglect ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' V1 neuron ', ' visual science ', ' vision science ', ' visual information ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' patient population ', ' sensory input ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NEI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,417500,0.10649947201436986
"Millisecond resolution statistics of cortical populations Project Summary/Abstract The mammalian brain builds and transforms representations of the outside world through the concerted activity of populations of neurons, but the extent to which spike times or spike counts are coordinated within these ensembles beyond pairs is not clear. Models of neural encoding predict variable frequencies of spike pattern occurrence, and models of decoding delineate requirements for spike time precision within the population response. While considerable effort has been made toward the development and refinement of the theoretical basis of such neural coding schemes, and predictions have been tested against single cell and pairwise data, there has been relatively little experimental data beyond pairs able to differentiate between competing hypotheses of population coding. The proposed career development plan aims to marry large-scale electrophysiology in primary visual cortex with analysis of specific predictions derived from computational and theoretical neuroscience work for spike time coordination beyond pairwise interactions. The candidate has a deep background in in vivo experimental techniques and proposes to receive training in the high-dimensional computational techniques and to use experimental data collected to validate specific theoretical predictions. This training will establish the skills necessary for a successful independent research career studying the mechanisms of information representation and transfer in visual cortex, bridging the gap between experimental and computational neuroscience. The candidate will carry out the mentored phase under the guidance of Dr. Clay Reid, a world expert in multiple aspects of mammalian central visual processing including anatomy, physiology, and computation. Additional advising from Dr. Eric Shea- Brown and Dr. Christof Koch will provide guidance in the theoretical and applied mathematical approaches required to implement and assess advanced models of neural encoding and decoding. The training will utilize the strengths of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in collecting large-scale data and the didactic opportunities at the University of Washington. In the independent phase the candidate will use the newly acquired analytical and modeling skills in combination with his previous training in optogenetic techniques to better constrain population measurements. This work will help establish a unique independent research program to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cortical representation. Project Narrative Understanding how the brain uses population activity to build representations of the outside world is an important step towards understanding not only sensory but also psychiatric and other cognitive disorders. This work on the fundamental nature of the neural code will contribute to the body of knowledge required to create effective brain interfaces for motor and sensory prostheses with the potential to reduce sensory disabilities, provide treatments for cognitive disorders, and aid in recovery from central nervous system trauma.",Millisecond resolution statistics of cortical populations,10006552,R00EY028612,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Animals ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive disease ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Institutes ', ' Mentors ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Perception ', ' Physiology ', ' Population Statistics ', ' Psychophysics ', ' psychophysical ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' area striata ', ' Primary visual cortex ', ' Striate Cortex ', ' Striate area ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' clay ', ' Measures ', ' Sensory Disorders ', ' career ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' Left ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Stimulus ', ' awake ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Development Plans ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Msec ', ' millisecond ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' sensory prosthesis ', ' visual processing ', ' Performance ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Population-Level Process ', ' Population Process ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Computational Technique ', ' Scheme ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' CNS trauma ', ' central nervous system trauma ', ' traumatic central nervous system injury ', ' Traumatic CNS injury ', ' Population ', ' extrastriate area ', ' extrastriate cortex ', ' visual area ', ' extrastriate visual cortex ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' neural model ', ' optogenetics ', ' math methodology ', ' math methods ', ' mathematical approach ', ' mathematical methodology ', ' mathematics approach ', ' mathematics methodology ', ' mathematics methods ', ' mathematical methods ', ' data resource ', ' high dimensionality ', ' deep learning ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large scale data ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R00,2020,249000,0.08027876788166426
"Neurocognitive basis of attention and eye movement guidance in the real world scenes Summary/Abstract Real world scenes contain a wealth of information that guide where we look and help us search for things in our visual environment more efficiently. For example, if you were looking for a person in a city, you would look mostly on the sidewalk, whereas if you were looking for a car, you would concentrate your attention on the street. Despite the fact that behavioral experiments have increasingly quantified the role of object and scene knowledge in the guidance of attention and eye movements, models of these processes, particularly neural models, neglect the role of visual knowledge. The goal of this project is to determine whether regions of the brain shown to be important for object and scene recognition are involved in visual guidance in natural scenes. Prior results, including our preliminary data, show that the neural activity from object processing regions can be used to predict what object a person is going to look at next. However, critical questions that remain are: is this predictive activity influenced by scene and object knowledge and is it causally related to visual guidance? Answering these two questions are the specific goals of this proposal. Individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy provide the rare opportunity of recording directly from the human brain (intracranial electroencephalography, iEEG), which provides a superior spatial and temporal resolution measure of brain activity compared to other technique. These direct recordings also allow for electrical brain stimulation (EBS), which can provide causal evidence tying the activity in particular regions to cognitive function. Finally, these data will be supplemented by magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to examine whole brain effects in healthy individuals. iEEG and MEG data arising from regions involved in object and scene recognition will be analyzed by multivariate machine learning techniques to continually classify what subjects are viewing on a moment-to- moment basis. Furthermore, we will try to predict what object subjects will view next during free viewing and visual search in natural scenes based on their neural data. We will assess how these neural signals are modified by the presence or absence of information about typical locations of objects or people in the scene that have been shown to guide behavior. Finally, using EBS we will determine if there is a causal link between the activity in regions involved in coding for object and scene knowledge and visual guidance in natural scene vision. If successful, these studies would necessitate a substantial reshaping of models of visual attention in the human brain. The results could form the foundation of a program of research into the neural basis of attention and eye movement guidance in the real world. Attention, perception, and eye movement abnormalities are seen in a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Thus, these studies, and the models that arise from them, have the translational potential to advance our understanding of the neurological basis of these disorders and suggest potential neurally inspired rehabilitation strategies. Narrative Abnormalities in visual attention and eye movement guidance are seen in a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including visual agnosia, neglect, schizophrenia, autism, etc. The neural basis of visual attention and eye movement guidance in the real world is unknown; therefore it remains unknown how neural abnormalities in these disorders relate to real world visual deficits, which is a critical barrier to designing hypothesis-driven remediation strategies. The proposed research will take critical early steps towards understanding the neural basis of real world attention and eye movement control, which has the potential to transform our understanding of these critical visual processes. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of eye movement and attentional guidance, a circuit relevant to a number of disorders, and take a critical step towards developing hypotheses for remediation strategies.",Neurocognitive basis of attention and eye movement guidance in the real world scenes,10004653,R21EY030297,"['Agnosia ', ' Monomodal visual amnesia ', ' Primary visual agnosia ', ' Visual amnesia ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cities ', ' Computers ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dyskinetic syndrome ', ' Abnormal Movements ', ' Dyskinesias ', ' Electrodes ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye Movements ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetoencephalography ', ' MEG imaging ', ' magnetoencephalographic imaging ', ' Study models ', ' Motivation ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Persons ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Object Attachment ', ' Object Relationship ', ' Psychological Bonding ', ' Pathology ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Saccades ', ' Saccadic Eye Movements ', ' Saccadic Pursuit ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Semantics ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Visual Cortex ', ' visual cortical ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Dorsal ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual Agnosias ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Electrical Stimulation of the Brain ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Parietal ', ' Stream ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Inferior ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' visual processing ', ' Visual attention ', ' eye tracking ', ' visual tracking ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Nerve Impulse Transmission ', ' Nerve Transmission ', ' Neuronal Transmission ', ' axon signaling ', ' axon-glial signaling ', ' axonal signaling ', ' glia signaling ', ' glial signaling ', ' nerve signaling ', ' neural signaling ', ' neuronal signaling ', ' neurotransmission ', ' Categories ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' visual search ', ' theories ', ' Brain region ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Fixation ', ' sample fixation ', ' Behavioral ', ' neglect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' remediation ', ' neural model ', ' computer monitor ', ' rehab strategy ', ' rehabilitation strategy ', ' spatial relationship ', ' visual process ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' attentional control ', ' temporal resolution ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal measurement ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2020,195625,0.11960993158866828
"High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging The cornea is the primary focusing structure of our visual system. Infections and diseases in the tissue can impair vision and lead to blindness, even in eyes with intact neurosensory function. Corneal disease is one of the leading causes of visual deficiency and blindness in the world. Tissue evaluation is an important step for assessing the health of the donor cornea and its appropriateness for different types of placement, yet this process suffers from high subjectivity. High-definition corneal imaging is needed to assist in selection of the most appropriate tissue for transplant. Progress on this front would greatly serve public need, as the cornea is the most commonly transplanted tissue worldwide, with nearly 185,000 transplants annually. Thus, a more sensitive and quantitative method for objective evaluation of tissue at eye banks is needed. We have developed a 3D high-definition imaging instrument based on Gabor-Domain Optical Coherence Microscopy (GDOCM). Our SBIR Phase I research successfully accomplished all Aims and demonstrated the feasibility of quantitative assessment of corneal tissue over a large field of view with GDOCM. Our Phase I results demonstrated that GDOCM has the following key advantages over existing corneal imaging techniques, which include specular and confocal microscopy: 1) improved accuracy of tissue qualification with 4-10x increase in field of view that reduces sampling error – this will provides a truer assessment of the overall tissue characteristics; 2) ability to simultaneously measure corneal thickness, quantify endothelial cell density, and identify morphological variations due to corneal disease – this will lead to complete corneal evaluation in a single instrument; 3) leveraging machine learning innovations to minimize variability induced by users – this will result in a more objective evaluation; 4) enhanced 3D cellular-level imaging of thin translucent endothelial cells – this will enable a detailed understanding of cell viability. The results of the proposed Phase studies II will demonstrate that GDOCM can provide high-definition, 3D visualization of corneal structures with immediate commercial application for qualification of donor tissue in eye banks, and with a path to in vivo clinical imaging of patients with corneal disease. Current corneal evaluation methods employed at eye banks have limited field of view and/or insufficient resolution, and their results suffer from high subjectivity. We propose to commercialize a Gabor-domain optical coherence microscope to enable non-invasive, high-definition, wide field of view imaging in 3D for eye banks.","High-definition, wide field of view corneal imaging",10239347,R44EY028827,"['Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Survival ', ' Cell Viability ', ' Cornea ', ' corneal ', ' Corneal Diseases ', ' Corneal Disorder ', ' cornea disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye Banks ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industry ', ' Infection ', ' instrumentation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Microscopy ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Optics ', ' optical ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' organ allograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ xenograft ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Research ', ' Rights ', ' Sampling Errors ', ' Standardization ', ' Technology ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' Tissue Donors ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Universities ', ' Visual impairment ', ' Diminished Vision ', ' Low Vision ', ' Partial Sight ', ' Reduced Vision ', ' Subnormal Vision ', ' vision impairment ', ' visually impaired ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Measures ', ' Tissue Transplantation ', ' Cell Density ', ' base ', ' density ', ' image processing ', ' Microscope ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Visual ', ' Measurement ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Morphology ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' vision loss ', ' visual loss ', ' Blindness ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Imaging Instrument ', ' Imaging Tool ', ' Imaging Device ', ' International ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Cell Viability Process ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' cell morphology ', ' Cellular Morphology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' in vivo regeneration ', ' visualization tool ', ' Visualization software ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' commercial application ', ' prototype ', ' phase II study ', ' phase 2 study ', ' screening ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' I-Corps ', ' Innovation Corps ', ' microscope imaging ', ' microscopy imaging ', ' microscopic imaging ', ' neuro-sensory ', ' neurosensory ', ' clinical imaging ', ' clinical development ', ' Patient imaging ', ' 3-D visualization ', ' 3-dimensional visualization ', ' 3D visualization ', ' three-dimensional visualization ', ' ']",NEI,LIGHTOPTECH CORPORATION,R44,2020,178785,0.08114428883261389
"Function and circuitry of adaptive inhibition in the retina Studies of the visual system face a number of challenges, two of which are the intricacy of the cell types and synaptic connections that comprise the nervous system, and the complexity of the computational processes that underlie vision. Although the retina is one of the most characterized and well understood neural circuits of the visual system, it nonetheless has a great diversity of cell types, connections and computations. The normal function of the retina is to convey information about natural visual scenes, which have complex spatial and temporal structure. The processing of natural scenes has the greatest relevance towards a fundamental understanding retinal function, and the greatest clinical relevance. Yet most studies of retinal visual processing and circuitry focus on responses to simple artificial stimuli rarely encountered normally, such as flashing spots, drifting stripes and flickering checkerboards. With respect to retinal cell types greatest diversity lies in a class of inhibitory interneurons known as amacrine cells. These cells make extensive lateral and feedback connections, and although they form stereotyped connections between each other, excitatory bipolar cells, and ganglion cells that transit signals in the optic nerve, the functional effects of nearly all of these cell types are poorly understood. This proposal aims towards a direct characterization of the functional effects of amacrine cells under ethologically relevant stimuli, including natural scenes. We combine approaches of perturbation and recording using electrical and optical methods as well as computational modeling to characterize the specific contributions of amacrine cells to stimuli that include the representation of moving objects. We take advantage of recently developed computational approaches that can simultaneously capture the retinal response to a broad range of stimuli including natural scenes, capture a wide range of phenomena previously characterized only with artificial stimuli, and that have internal units highly correlated with retinal interneurons. Our goals are to 1) Create a quantitative understanding of the functional contributions of a class of sustained amacrine cells in the salamander retina for specific stimuli including those that represent moving objects and natural scenes, and test hypotheses related to dynamic effects on visual sensitivity and sensory features generated by those amacrine cells 2) Use molecularly defined amacrine cells in the mouse to quantitatively characterize the functional contribution of specific amacrine cell types to specific stimuli including artificial moving objects and natural scenes. These studies create a new way to generate and test hypotheses related to the quantitative effect of any interneuron on retinal output under any visual stimulus. Understanding how retinal circuitry creates visual processing under natural scenes is critical to our understanding of retinal mechanisms and diseases involving the degeneration of the retinal circuitry. In addition, the computational descriptions of retinal responses will be directly useful in the design of electronic retinal prosthesis systems. The retina is a complex network of many cell types, including the most diverse but poorlyunderstood class of cells, amacrine cells. By understanding how inhibitory neurons change neural processing in the retina under natural visual scenes, we can begin to address how these cells and their connections degenerate during retinal diseases, an essential step in designing treatments for these diseases. Furthermore, by creating accurate computational models of the retinal response to natural scenes, this research will be immediately applicable to electronic retinal prosthesis systems that aim to restore vision in cases of photoreceptor degeneration.",Function and circuitry of adaptive inhibition in the retina,9892016,R01EY022933,"['Archives ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Methods ', ' Motion ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Nervous system structure ', ' Nervous System ', ' Neurologic Body System ', ' Neurologic Organ System ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Optic Nerve ', ' Cranial Nerve II ', ' Second Cranial Nerve ', ' Periodicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Research ', ' Retina ', ' Retinal Degeneration ', ' degenerative retina diseases ', ' retina degeneration ', ' retinal degenerative ', ' retinal degenerative diseases ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Retinal Ganglion Cells ', ' retinal ganglion ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Synapses ', ' Synaptic ', ' synapse ', ' Testing ', ' Theoretical Studies ', ' Time ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Measures ', ' Salamander ', ' Lateral ', ' gangliocyte ', ' ganglion cell ', ' Amacrine Cells ', ' Stimulus ', ' Visual ', ' receptive field ', ' Spottings ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' extracellular ', ' interest ', ' Visual System ', ' Visual system structure ', ' visual processing ', ' visual stimulus ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Structure ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neurocircuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Modeling ', ' Connectionist Models ', ' Neural Network Models ', ' Perceptrons ', ' Neural Network Simulation ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Optical Methods ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' photoreceptor degeneration ', ' inhibitory neuron ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' computational resources ', ' computing resources ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' artificial retina ', ' prosthetic retina ', ' retinal prosthetic ', ' retinal prosthesis ', ' biological systems ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' predicting response ', ' connectome ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Injections ', ' ConvNet ', ' convolutional network ', ' convolutional neural nets ', ' convolutional neural network ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,392194,0.12263403409827733
