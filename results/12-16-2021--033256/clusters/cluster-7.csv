"STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY AND TARGETED DRUG DESIGN FOR AIDS This proposal will focus on the use of structural biology to aid in the development of drugs that can interfere in a specific manner with protein products of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genome.  Since HIV is the etiological agent implicated in Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), it is hoped that these drugs will cure or at least arrest the symptoms of AIDS.

However, it can be anticipated that the methodologies developed in this AIDS-targeted project could lay the foundations for the development of other anti-viral agents that inevitably will evolve in the future to plaque mankind.

Recombinant methods for viral protein production will be developed.  These proteins, as well as viral proteins obtained from external sources, as appropriate, will be highly purified, crystallized and subjected to X-ray diffraction (or NMR) analysis.

"OBJECT-ORIENTED SIMULATION OF HIV- AND CNS/HIV INFECTION OBJECT-ORIENTED SIMULATION OF HIV-AND CNS/HIV-INFECTION.  Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is the ultimate consequence of a multi-faceted disease process caused by infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).  Due to a selective tropism of HIV for the cluster designation 4 (CD4) receptor population, infection involves both the immune system and the nervous system.  Progressively evolving degenerate conditions in both systems render the host increasingly susceptible to ""opportunistic"" infections, with a high mortality rate.  Previous clinical studies have indicated that at least three critical events are involved in the pathogenesis of AIDS.  The first is viral infection of helper T lymphocytes and monocytes early in the course of the disease, the second is the contribution of inductive signals from both cell types to disease progression, and the third is the transport of HIV into the brain by infected monocytes.  These observations lead us to pose two questions: (1) how does the dynamics of HIV-infection depend on the dynamics of communication between these central cell-types and, (2) how can selective, i.e. local, changes in this dynamics cause a global alteration of immune function?  We will approach these question by studying helper T cell-macrophage interaction and the resulting cytokine production as well as stress-related immunomodulation in the context of a novel computer- experimental system that we developed previously.  This system allows the prediction of long-term behavior in the normal and diseased immune system.  We will specifically evaluate the production of cytokines Interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-5, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), Neuroleukin (NLK) and Interferon gamma (y-IFN) associated with a single infection (HIV), multiple infections (HIV + other antigens) and neurological stressors.  These experiments are designed to distinguish between reversible and irreversible effects of a progressive regulatory disease leading to a degenerative disease in distributed cellular systems.

"KNOWLEDGE-BASED RECORDS FOR PATIENTS WITH HIV INFECTIONS Primary care physicians are burdened by the complexity of the care that must be delivered to patients with HIV infection, the time required for care and the difficulty of keeping abreast of a rapidly changing knowledge base that is the foundation for that care.

"MICROCOMPUTER SOFTWARE FOR CHLAMYDIA RISK ASSESSMENT DESCRIPTION:  (From investigator's abstract) The application organization has completed design and programming for a microcomputer software system providing personal self-administered risk assessment for HIV infection. The risk assessment is based upon an anonymous interactive interview and analysis performed by a rule-based expert system incorporated in the software.  The purpose of this proposal is to support revision and expansion of the software to accommodate simultaneous risk assessment for chlamydia trachomatis, the most prevalent sexually transmissible disease in the nation.  The system will not require respondents to possess specialized training or computer experience.  Following analysis of an individual's personal history taken by the interactive interview, the completed software will respond with advice as to whether the respondent is at risk for HIV and/or chlamydia trachomatis and will also write anonymous case data to DOS files for interface with statistical software.

"NEW ORLEANS COOP AGREEMENT FOR AIDS CMTY OUTREACH/INTERV This application proposes to conduct a five-year study to monitor HIV risk behavior and evaluate the effectiveness of an enhanced intervention to combat the spread of HIV infection among targeted populations in New Orleans.  The targeted populations include intravenous drug users (IVDUs), prostitutes who trade sex for drugs or money, crack cocaine users, and the sexual partners of IVDUs, prostitutes, and crack users. All participants in the proposed study will be drawn from ten large public housing projects in New Orleans.  The study will employ a quasi-experimental design in which the ten housing projects will be matched on important characteristics into pairs.  One of each pair of matched projects will be randomly assigned to an experimental (i.e., ""enhanced"") or control (i.e., ""standard"") intervention condition.  The experimental intervention, which builds upon our recent research experience in community outreach to IVDUs, will consist of (a) a CDC approved ""knowledge-based"" intervention protocol provided at our outreach office by trained personnel, (b) additional information on HIV prevention provided at our office, and (c) risk reduction skills-building training provided in six ""onsite"" sessions that will be conducted with participants on their own turf in the housing projects over a 12-week period.  Participants who reside in the five housing projects randomly assigned to the control condition will receive the standard CDC intervention only at our outreach office. After 30 months, the enhanced intervention will be extended to persons drawn from the housing projects in the control condition.  Outcome measures will consist primarily of indicators of HIV risk behavior as measured by NIDA's AIA and AFA.  In addition, we will assess other potentially important outcomes, such as psychological adjustment, readiness for drug treatment, number and length of drug treatment episodes, etc.  Process measures will include assessment of level of treatment implementation and across-condition contamination.  Multi- variate and tabular analyses will be used to assess the initial comparability of participants from the pairs of housing projects, measure the reactivity of the AIA and AFA with the intervention, and evaluate the effectiveness of the enhanced intervention.

"COMPUTER EDUCATION AND RISK ASSESSMENT FOR HIV INFECTION This project is to support the continued testing, validation, and refinement of computer software for personal anonymous risk assessment for HIV infection.  The software, originally developed as a stand-alone microcomputer system, performs a detailed interview in privacy.  Personal sexual history data provided by the respondent is analyzed by the software's expert system which incorporates probability computation supported by databases consisting of local estimates of HIV infection and per-event infectivity specific to vaginal and anal intercourse.  The software also interviews respondents and assesses risk on the basis of personal intravenous drug abuse and blood transfusion history.  The software advises respondents as to whether their past experience places them at risk for HIV infection.  If so, they are advised to follow up with antibody tests. Users not at risk are cautioned to avoid risk of exposure to HIV.  The interactive interview is preceded by a sequence of educational screens.  Additionally, the software writes anonymous interview data to disk file for statistical analysis in support of health behavior research.  The software was tested in a preliminary study which yielded publication. Continued research was supported by a Phase I SBIR grant.

"HIV-1 Adaptation in the Central Nervous System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) occurs early after infection. Viral adaptation to replication in the CNS and its immunologic sequelae results in clinical neuropathological sequelae in up to 50% of untreated patients. Both host and viral determinants may mediate the neuropathology that results in the clinical syndromes of HIV associated dementia (HIV-D) and minor motor cognitive disorder (MMCD). In this study, we will examine the rate and possible determinants of evolution of HIV-1 in the CNS through 3 specific aims. SA 1: HIV-1 gp160 and nef sequence evolution will be assessed by comparing plasma and CSF virus in untreated patients identified in primary infection that are followed over 3 to 5 years employing rapid and sensitive screening of length polymorphism in V1-2 A/4-5 of env and clonal sequence analysis of env and nef. Concurrently, blood and CSF virus comparisons will be performed on longitudinal samples from a cohort of patients with chronic infection over a 3 to 5 year period to provide. Where differences are found, machine learning algorithms and multiple regression analysis will be performed to identify individual positions that contribute to sequence evolution with attention to glycosylation sites that alter neutralization by antibody, V3 positions that affect tropism or putative neurotoxicity, and CTL epitopes described in both env and nef. SA 2: In well characterized autopsy samples, CSF, plasma, parenchymal brain regions, spleen, lymph node and colon will be examined for proviral DNA sequences and RNA sequences, in order to characterize the composition of the HIV population in CNS and to determine the subset of viral variants that are productively replicating. SA 3: Prototypical env sequences identified in SA 1 and 2 will be cloned into expression vectors and co- receptor density dependence and usage and antibody neutralization susceptibility will be assessed.

"NeuroAIDS in India    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NeuroAIDS in India Viral and host factors, as well as comorbidities, play key roles in determining susceptibility to the neurologic complications associated with HIV infection. Most studies of HIV-related neurocognitive impairment have been conducted in Western countries, where HIV clade B predominates. Worldwide, however, clade C is much more common and recent virologic studies suggest that its neurovirulence may differ from clade B. Approximately 5 million individuals are infected with HIV in India, the vast majority with clade C virus. In the present study we will address the following aims within an Indian cohort: 1) to determine the prevalence and nature of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (HNCI) in HIV-infected individuals who are not on antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, 2) to determine the impact of newly-initiated ARV treatment on cognitive functioning, 3) to assess the viral (env, tat) genetics associated with HNCI, and 4) to determine the relationship between HNCI and host immunogenetic factors (i.e., genotype MCP-1, CCL3L1 copy number, RANTES and polymorphisms in CCR5/CCR2 to define CCR5 haplotypes). Building upon collaboration between the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Center (HNRC) in the U.S. and the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) in Pune, India, we propose to examine 300 HIV+ individuals prior to initiation of ARVs in linked studies (HPTN 052, India National AIDS Control Organization program) and follow them annually thereafter. We will also enroll an HIV seronegative comparison group in order to establish neuropsychological norms for determining impairment in individual HIV+ persons. The feasibility of this study has been demonstrated by a pilot study in which we created Marathi-translated instruments, trained India personnel, and examined 60 participants using methods originally developed at the HNRC but adapted to India. This project will potentially a) lead to improved understanding of the characteristics and correlates of neurologic complications of clade C HIV infection in India and b) enhance existing clinical and scientific expertise in India via technology transfer in the areas of cognitive assessments, genomics, and biomarker assays.           ",NeuroAIDS in India,7229320,R01MH078748,"['Cysteine ', '

"Targeted Empirical Super Learning in HIV Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this project is to study and extend a general statistical methodology, called Targeted Empirical Learning, which includes a recently developed Targeted Maximum Likelihood methodology. The fundamental theoretical underpinnings of this new and unified approach to statistical learning have been developed and we propose to expand Targeted Empirical Learning into a practical product that can be applied to pressing scientific questions. Building on long-standing collaborations with leading scientists in the areas of clinical AIDS research, we will use this novel methodology to address research questions concerning HIV. Given observed data consisting of a realization of n independently and identically distributed random variables, Targeted Empirical Learning employs the following elements: i) defining the parameter of interest; 2) modeling the parameter of interest, leaving the nuisance parameters unspecified or only including truly known modeling assumptions; 3) developing targeted robust and highly efficient (maximum likelihood) estimators of the parameter of interest. The methodology relies on unified cross- validation to choose between competitive estimators indexed by, for example, choices of sieves parameterizations, algorithms, and/or dimension reductions (in particular for the nuisance parameters). Importantly, the cross-validation criterion employed evaluates the performance of these candidate estimators with respect to the parameter of interest. Specific applications to be addressed include the following: i) develop models and corresponding targeted empirical learners of optimal individualized treatment rules for treating HIV-infected patients, 2) estimate measures of variable importance/causal effects for mutations in the HIV virus for predicting clinical response to drug combinations; 3) estimate causal effects of adherence profiles on virologic suppression for HIV-infected patients. We will further develop and apply a novel resampling-based multiple testing methodology to properly address our simultaneous testing and estimation of many scientific parameters of interest.           ",Targeted Empirical Super Learning in HIV Research,7338072,R01AI074345,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug resistance ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Observational Study ', ' Validation ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Genotype ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Hand ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Algorithms ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' In Vitro ', ' indexing ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Numbers ', ' Disease Progression ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nucleosides ', ' Patients ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Daily ', ' Protease Inhibitor ', ' Proteinase Inhibitors ', ' Protease Antagonists ', ' Peptide Peptidohydrolase Inhibitors ', ' Peptide Hydrolase Inhibitors ', ' Peptidase Inhibitors ', ' Endopeptidase Inhibitors ', ' Antiproteases ', ' tool ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Writing ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' user friendly software ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Documentation ', ' Communities ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' Outcome ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' treatment effect ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2007,373503,0.10874860009606249
"Public HIV Drug Resistance Database    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV drug resistance data are critical for HIV drug resistance surveillance, antiretroviral drug design, and the management of persons infected with drug-resistant HIV. Three fundamental types of correlations form the basis of drug resistance knowledge: (1) Correlations between genotypic data with the treatments of persons from whom sequenced HIV-1 isolates have been obtained (genotype-treatment); (2) Correlations between genotype and in vitro drug susceptibility (genotype-phenotype); and (3) Correlations between genotype and the clinical response to a new treatment regimen (genotype-outcome). Accordingly our three plans are as follows: (1) To use phylogenetically-based statistical analysis of correlations between mutations in the targets of HIV therapy (genotype) and antiretroviral treatment to distinguish between drug- and non-drug- related HIV-1 evolution, to identify temporal and geographic patterns in the prevalence of drug resistance, and to identify the spread of viruses with particular patterns of drug-resistance mutations. (2) To use patterns of mutations in the targets of antiretroviral therapy, antiretroviral treatment data, and in vitro drug susceptibility results to help prioritize the clinical development of experimental antiretroviral compounds. (3) To us correlations between genotype-phenotype and genotype-clinical outcome to identify the treatment regimens most likely to be effective in persons with acquired or transmitted drug resistance. In order to accomplish these aims, we will expand the online publicly available Stanford HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database to represent, store, and analyze the diverse forms of data underlying drug resistance knowledge. Standardized protocols for exchanging data with the broad community of researchers studying HIV-1 drug resistance will be refined and validated. Improved methods for representing published drug resistance data, performing temporal queries and knowledge discovery, and for analyzing genotypic resistance data in a phylogenetic context will be implemented. This proposal is also the start of a three-way collaboration between Stanford University, the University College of London (UCL), and Oxford University. UCL is on the forefront of research into the problem of transmitted drug resistance and Oxford University is on the forefront of research on virus evolution and population genetics.           ",Public HIV Drug Resistance Database,7228273,R01AI068581,"['Drug Design ', ' Drug resistance ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Recombinants ', ' in vivo ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' trend ', ' Evolution ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV-1 ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' London ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Multi-Drug Resistance ', ' multidrug resistant ', ' multi-drug resistant ', ' Resistant to multidrug ', ' Resistant to multi-drug ', ' Resistant to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistance to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistance to Multidrug ', ' Resistance to Multi-drug ', ' Multiple Drug Resistant ', ' Multiple Drug Resistance ', ' Multidrug Resistance ', ' Pliability ', ' pliable ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Persons ', ' Collaborations ', ' Peptide Hydrolases ', ' Proteolytic Enzymes ', ' Proteinases ', ' Proteases ', ' Peptidases ', ' Esteroproteases ', ' Endopeptidases ', ' Peptide Peptidohydrolases ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Universities ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Work ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Viral ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Disease regression ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' HIV therapy ', ' Communities ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' HIV drug resistance ', ' resistant to HIV drug ', ' resistance to antiHIV ', ' resistance to anti-HIV ', ' resistance to HIV drug ', ' HIV drug resistant ', ' AntiHIV resistant ', ' AntiHIV resistance ', ' Anti-HIV resistant ', ' Anti-HIV resistance ', ' HIV-1 drug resistance ', ' resistant to HIV1 drug ', ' resistant to HIV-1 drug ', ' resistance to HIV1 drug ', ' resistance to HIV-1 drug ', ' HIV1 drug resistant ', ' HIV1 drug resistance ', ' HIV-1 drug resistant ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' ']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,597997,0.14092727955692938
"Multiscale studies of HIV infection and treatment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term objective of this application is to develop physical models and mathematical tools for optimizing treatments of HIV with fusion-inhibiting therapies. Kinetic data of virion-receptor interactions will be used to quantitatively categorize HIV strains based on fusogenicity (in the presence of varying CD4 and CCR5 receptor surface concentrations). Assays for mixtures of HIV strains will be proposed. Specific aims include:    (1) Developing chemical kinetic models for HIV virus envelope protein-cell receptor interactions and fusion rates. These models will be used to analyze kinetic measurements and estimate parameters used in within-host virus population models. (2) Developing statistical measures for categorizing strains based on kinetic binding and fusion data. Two approaches will be used: principal components analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis. PCA will be applied directly to the data to find the viral strains whose fusogenicities span a sufficient range in receptor/coreceptor (e.g., CD4/CCR5) concentrations. Kinetic models derived in Aim (1) will be used to represent the kinetic data in a cluster analysis.    (3) Using the theory of branching processes and the information garnered from Aims (1) and (2) to develop and improve upon models of HIV evolution. Both deterministic and stochastic models will be studied. (4) Developing deterministic models for gene therapy (via modification of, e.g., CD4/CCR5 expression) to determine the efficacy of proposed stem cell gene therapies in the face of mutations. Deterministic viral population models will be coupled to the stochastic theories developed in Aim (3) to compute probabilities of emergence and extinction of low-concentration, gene therapy-resistant strains. The proposed research represents a systematic, quantitative approach to the basic study of HIV-receptor/coreceptor interactions, and will potentially aid in optimizing drug treatments and gene therapies.

"HIV-1 Adaptation in the Central Nervous System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) occurs early after infection. Viral adaptation to replication in the CNS and its immunologic sequelae results in clinical neuropathological sequelae in up to 50% of untreated patients. Both host and viral determinants may mediate the neuropathology that results in the clinical syndromes of HIV associated dementia (HIV-D) and minor motor cognitive disorder (MMCD). In this study, we will examine the rate and possible determinants of evolution of HIV-1 in the CNS through 3 specific aims. SA 1: HIV-1 gp160 and nef sequence evolution will be assessed by comparing plasma and CSF virus in untreated patients identified in primary infection that are followed over 3 to 5 years employing rapid and sensitive screening of length polymorphism in V1-2 A/4-5 of env and clonal sequence analysis of env and nef. Concurrently, blood and CSF virus comparisons will be performed on longitudinal samples from a cohort of patients with chronic infection over a 3 to 5 year period to provide. Where differences are found, machine learning algorithms and multiple regression analysis will be performed to identify individual positions that contribute to sequence evolution with attention to glycosylation sites that alter neutralization by antibody, V3 positions that affect tropism or putative neurotoxicity, and CTL epitopes described in both env and nef. SA 2: In well characterized autopsy samples, CSF, plasma, parenchymal brain regions, spleen, lymph node and colon will be examined for proviral DNA sequences and RNA sequences, in order to characterize the composition of the HIV population in CNS and to determine the subset of viral variants that are productively replicating. SA 3: Prototypical env sequences identified in SA 1 and 2 will be cloned into expression vectors and co- receptor density dependence and usage and antibody neutralization susceptibility will be assessed.

"Targeted Empirical Super Learning in HIV Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this project is to study and extend a general statistical methodology, called Targeted Empirical Learning, which includes a recently developed Targeted Maximum Likelihood methodology. The fundamental theoretical underpinnings of this new and unified approach to statistical learning have been developed and we propose to expand Targeted Empirical Learning into a practical product that can be applied to pressing scientific questions. Building on long-standing collaborations with leading scientists in the areas of clinical AIDS research, we will use this novel methodology to address research questions concerning HIV. Given observed data consisting of a realization of n independently and identically distributed random variables, Targeted Empirical Learning employs the following elements: i) defining the parameter of interest; 2) modeling the parameter of interest, leaving the nuisance parameters unspecified or only including truly known modeling assumptions; 3) developing targeted robust and highly efficient (maximum likelihood) estimators of the parameter of interest. The methodology relies on unified cross- validation to choose between competitive estimators indexed by, for example, choices of sieves parameterizations, algorithms, and/or dimension reductions (in particular for the nuisance parameters). Importantly, the cross-validation criterion employed evaluates the performance of these candidate estimators with respect to the parameter of interest. Specific applications to be addressed include the following: i) develop models and corresponding targeted empirical learners of optimal individualized treatment rules for treating HIV-infected patients, 2) estimate measures of variable importance/causal effects for mutations in the HIV virus for predicting clinical response to drug combinations; 3) estimate causal effects of adherence profiles on virologic suppression for HIV-infected patients. We will further develop and apply a novel resampling-based multiple testing methodology to properly address our simultaneous testing and estimation of many scientific parameters of interest.           ",Targeted Empirical Super Learning in HIV Research,7447417,R01AI074345,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug resistance ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Observational Study ', ' Validation ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Genotype ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Hand ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Algorithms ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' In Vitro ', ' indexing ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Numbers ', ' Disease Progression ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nucleosides ', ' Patients ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Daily ', ' Protease Inhibitor ', ' Proteinase Inhibitors ', ' Protease Antagonists ', ' Peptide Peptidohydrolase Inhibitors ', ' Peptide Hydrolase Inhibitors ', ' Peptidase Inhibitors ', ' Endopeptidase Inhibitors ', ' Antiproteases ', ' tool ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Writing ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' user friendly software ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Documentation ', ' Communities ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' Outcome ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' treatment effect ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2008,458533,0.10874860009606249
"HIV-1 Adaptation in the Central Nervous System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) occurs early after infection. Viral adaptation to replication in the CNS and its immunologic sequelae results in clinical neuropathological sequelae in up to 50% of untreated patients. Both host and viral determinants may mediate the neuropathology that results in the clinical syndromes of HIV associated dementia (HIV-D) and minor motor cognitive disorder (MMCD). In this study, we will examine the rate and possible determinants of evolution of HIV-1 in the CNS through 3 specific aims. SA 1: HIV-1 gp160 and nef sequence evolution will be assessed by comparing plasma and CSF virus in untreated patients identified in primary infection that are followed over 3 to 5 years employing rapid and sensitive screening of length polymorphism in V1-2 A/4-5 of env and clonal sequence analysis of env and nef. Concurrently, blood and CSF virus comparisons will be performed on longitudinal samples from a cohort of patients with chronic infection over a 3 to 5 year period to provide. Where differences are found, machine learning algorithms and multiple regression analysis will be performed to identify individual positions that contribute to sequence evolution with attention to glycosylation sites that alter neutralization by antibody, V3 positions that affect tropism or putative neurotoxicity, and CTL epitopes described in both env and nef. SA 2: In well characterized autopsy samples, CSF, plasma, parenchymal brain regions, spleen, lymph node and colon will be examined for proviral DNA sequences and RNA sequences, in order to characterize the composition of the HIV population in CNS and to determine the subset of viral variants that are productively replicating. SA 3: Prototypical env sequences identified in SA 1 and 2 will be cloned into expression vectors and co- receptor density dependence and usage and antibody neutralization susceptibility will be assessed. Sequence change in putative HLA restricted CTL epitopes in nef and env will be correlated with patient HLA type. Together, these studies will begin to identify and characterize immunologic determinants of HIV evolution in the CNS.

"Public HIV Drug Resistance Database    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV drug resistance data are critical for HIV drug resistance surveillance, antiretroviral drug design, and the management of persons infected with drug-resistant HIV. Three fundamental types of correlations form the basis of drug resistance knowledge: (1) Correlations between genotypic data with the treatments of persons from whom sequenced HIV-1 isolates have been obtained (genotype-treatment); (2) Correlations between genotype and in vitro drug susceptibility (genotype-phenotype); and (3) Correlations between genotype and the clinical response to a new treatment regimen (genotype-outcome). Accordingly our three plans are as follows: (1) To use phylogenetically-based statistical analysis of correlations between mutations in the targets of HIV therapy (genotype) and antiretroviral treatment to distinguish between drug- and non-drug- related HIV-1 evolution, to identify temporal and geographic patterns in the prevalence of drug resistance, and to identify the spread of viruses with particular patterns of drug-resistance mutations. (2) To use patterns of mutations in the targets of antiretroviral therapy, antiretroviral treatment data, and in vitro drug susceptibility results to help prioritize the clinical development of experimental antiretroviral compounds. (3) To us correlations between genotype-phenotype and genotype-clinical outcome to identify the treatment regimens most likely to be effective in persons with acquired or transmitted drug resistance. In order to accomplish these aims, we will expand the online publicly available Stanford HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database to represent, store, and analyze the diverse forms of data underlying drug resistance knowledge. Standardized protocols for exchanging data with the broad community of researchers studying HIV-1 drug resistance will be refined and validated. Improved methods for representing published drug resistance data, performing temporal queries and knowledge discovery, and for analyzing genotypic resistance data in a phylogenetic context will be implemented. This proposal is also the start of a three-way collaboration between Stanford University, the University College of London (UCL), and Oxford University. UCL is on the forefront of research into the problem of transmitted drug resistance and Oxford University is on the forefront of research on virus evolution and population genetics.           ",Public HIV Drug Resistance Database,7416601,R01AI068581,"['Drug Design ', ' Drug resistance ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Recombinants ', ' in vivo ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' trend ', ' Evolution ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV-1 ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' London ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Multi-Drug Resistance ', ' multidrug resistant ', ' multi-drug resistant ', ' Resistant to multidrug ', ' Resistant to multi-drug ', ' Resistant to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistance to Multiple Drug ', ' Resistance to Multidrug ', ' Resistance to Multi-drug ', ' Multiple Drug Resistant ', ' Multiple Drug Resistance ', ' Multidrug Resistance ', ' Pliability ', ' pliable ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Persons ', ' Collaborations ', ' Peptide Hydrolases ', ' Proteolytic Enzymes ', ' Proteinases ', ' Proteases ', ' Peptidases ', ' Esteroproteases ', ' Endopeptidases ', ' Peptide Peptidohydrolases ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Universities ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Work ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Viral ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Disease regression ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' HIV therapy ', ' Communities ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' HIV drug resistance ', ' resistant to HIV drug ', ' resistance to antiHIV ', ' resistance to anti-HIV ', ' resistance to HIV drug ', ' HIV drug resistant ', ' AntiHIV resistant ', ' AntiHIV resistance ', ' Anti-HIV resistant ', ' Anti-HIV resistance ', ' HIV-1 drug resistance ', ' resistant to HIV1 drug ', ' resistant to HIV-1 drug ', ' resistance to HIV1 drug ', ' resistance to HIV-1 drug ', ' HIV1 drug resistant ', ' HIV1 drug resistance ', ' HIV-1 drug resistant ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' ']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,603954,0.14092727955692938
"NeuroAIDS in India    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NeuroAIDS in India Viral and host factors, as well as comorbidities, play key roles in determining susceptibility to the neurologic complications associated with HIV infection. Most studies of HIV-related neurocognitive impairment have been conducted in Western countries, where HIV clade B predominates. Worldwide, however, clade C is much more common and recent virologic studies suggest that its neurovirulence may differ from clade B. Approximately 5 million individuals are infected with HIV in India, the vast majority with clade C virus. In the present study we will address the following aims within an Indian cohort: 1) to determine the prevalence and nature of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (HNCI) in HIV-infected individuals who are not on antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, 2) to determine the impact of newly-initiated ARV treatment on cognitive functioning, 3) to assess the viral (env, tat) genetics associated with HNCI, and 4) to determine the relationship between HNCI and host immunogenetic factors (i.e., genotype MCP-1, CCL3L1 copy number, RANTES and polymorphisms in CCR5/CCR2 to define CCR5 haplotypes). Building upon collaboration between the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Center (HNRC) in the U.S. and the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) in Pune, India, we propose to examine 300 HIV+ individuals prior to initiation of ARVs in linked studies (HPTN 052, India National AIDS Control Organization program) and follow them annually thereafter. We will also enroll an HIV seronegative comparison group in order to establish neuropsychological norms for determining impairment in individual HIV+ persons. The feasibility of this study has been demonstrated by a pilot study in which we created Marathi-translated instruments, trained India personnel, and examined 60 participants using methods originally developed at the HNRC but adapted to India. This project will potentially a) lead to improved understanding of the characteristics and correlates of neurologic complications of clade C HIV infection in India and b) enhance existing clinical and scientific expertise in India via technology transfer in the areas of cognitive assessments, genomics, and biomarker assays.           ",NeuroAIDS in India,7434423,R01MH078748,"['Cysteine ', '

"A Multi-Site Investigation into the Effect of HIV Clade on Neurocognitive Impairm    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 is one of the most genetically diverse pathogens on earth. In fact, some coding regions, such as envelope, can have more than 30% genetic difference between clades. The neurocognitive effects of clade B HIV-1 infection have been well characterized in the developed world; however, there continues to be controversy surronding the effect of non-clade B infection on the neurocognitive functioning. The overarching aims of the proposed study is to 1) characterize and compare the burden of HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) occurring among individuals living in Brazil, China, India, Romania and the United States and infected with CRF01_AE and clades B, C and F, and 2) evaluate the neurovirulent and neurotropic genotypic determinants between subtypes.

"Multiscale studies of HIV infection and treatment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term objective of this application is to develop physical models and mathematical tools for optimizing treatments of HIV with fusion-inhibiting therapies. Kinetic data of virion-receptor interactions will be used to quantitatively categorize HIV strains based on fusogenicity (in the presence of varying CD4 and CCR5 receptor surface concentrations). Assays for mixtures of HIV strains will be proposed. Specific aims include:    (1) Developing chemical kinetic models for HIV virus envelope protein-cell receptor interactions and fusion rates. These models will be used to analyze kinetic measurements and estimate parameters used in within-host virus population models. (2) Developing statistical measures for categorizing strains based on kinetic binding and fusion data. Two approaches will be used: principal components analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis. PCA will be applied directly to the data to find the viral strains whose fusogenicities span a sufficient range in receptor/coreceptor (e.g., CD4/CCR5) concentrations. Kinetic models derived in Aim (1) will be used to represent the kinetic data in a cluster analysis.    (3) Using the theory of branching processes and the information garnered from Aims (1) and (2) to develop and improve upon models of HIV evolution. Both deterministic and stochastic models will be studied. (4) Developing deterministic models for gene therapy (via modification of, e.g., CD4/CCR5 expression) to determine the efficacy of proposed stem cell gene therapies in the face of mutations. Deterministic viral population models will be coupled to the stochastic theories developed in Aim (3) to compute probabilities of emergence and extinction of low-concentration, gene therapy-resistant strains. The proposed research represents a systematic, quantitative approach to the basic study of HIV-receptor/coreceptor interactions, and will potentially aid in optimizing drug treatments and gene therapies.

"HIV-1 Adaptation in the Central Nervous System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) occurs early after infection. Viral adaptation to replication in the CNS and its immunologic sequelae results in clinical neuropathological sequelae in up to 50% of untreated patients. Both host and viral determinants may mediate the neuropathology that results in the clinical syndromes of HIV associated dementia (HIV-D) and minor motor cognitive disorder (MMCD). In this study, we will examine the rate and possible determinants of evolution of HIV-1 in the CNS through 3 specific aims. SA 1: HIV-1 gp160 and nef sequence evolution will be assessed by comparing plasma and CSF virus in untreated patients identified in primary infection that are followed over 3 to 5 years employing rapid and sensitive screening of length polymorphism in V1-2 A/4-5 of env and clonal sequence analysis of env and nef. Concurrently, blood and CSF virus comparisons will be performed on longitudinal samples from a cohort of patients with chronic infection over a 3 to 5 year period to provide. Where differences are found, machine learning algorithms and multiple regression analysis will be performed to identify individual positions that contribute to sequence evolution with attention to glycosylation sites that alter neutralization by antibody, V3 positions that affect tropism or putative neurotoxicity, and CTL epitopes described in both env and nef. SA 2: In well characterized autopsy samples, CSF, plasma, parenchymal brain regions, spleen, lymph node and colon will be examined for proviral DNA sequences and RNA sequences, in order to characterize the composition of the HIV population in CNS and to determine the subset of viral variants that are productively replicating. SA 3: Prototypical env sequences identified in SA 1 and 2 will be cloned into expression vectors and co- receptor density dependence and usage and antibody neutralization susceptibility will be assessed. Sequence change in putative HLA restricted CTL epitopes in nef and env will be correlated with patient HLA type. Together, these studies will begin to identify and characterize immunologic determinants of HIV evolution in the CNS.

"Targeted Empirical Super Learning in HIV Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this project is to study and extend a general statistical methodology, called Targeted Empirical Learning, which includes a recently developed Targeted Maximum Likelihood methodology. The fundamental theoretical underpinnings of this new and unified approach to statistical learning have been developed and we propose to expand Targeted Empirical Learning into a practical product that can be applied to pressing scientific questions. Building on long-standing collaborations with leading scientists in the areas of clinical AIDS research, we will use this novel methodology to address research questions concerning HIV. Given observed data consisting of a realization of n independently and identically distributed random variables, Targeted Empirical Learning employs the following elements: i) defining the parameter of interest; 2) modeling the parameter of interest, leaving the nuisance parameters unspecified or only including truly known modeling assumptions; 3) developing targeted robust and highly efficient (maximum likelihood) estimators of the parameter of interest. The methodology relies on unified cross- validation to choose between competitive estimators indexed by, for example, choices of sieves parameterizations, algorithms, and/or dimension reductions (in particular for the nuisance parameters). Importantly, the cross-validation criterion employed evaluates the performance of these candidate estimators with respect to the parameter of interest. Specific applications to be addressed include the following: i) develop models and corresponding targeted empirical learners of optimal individualized treatment rules for treating HIV-infected patients, 2) estimate measures of variable importance/causal effects for mutations in the HIV virus for predicting clinical response to drug combinations; 3) estimate causal effects of adherence profiles on virologic suppression for HIV-infected patients. We will further develop and apply a novel resampling-based multiple testing methodology to properly address our simultaneous testing and estimation of many scientific parameters of interest.           ",Targeted Empirical Super Learning in HIV Research,7649489,R01AI074345,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug resistance ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Observational Study ', ' Validation ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Genotype ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Hand ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Algorithms ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' In Vitro ', ' indexing ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Disease Progression ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nucleosides ', ' Patients ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Protease Inhibitor ', ' Proteinase Inhibitors ', ' Protease Antagonists ', ' Peptide Peptidohydrolase Inhibitors ', ' Peptide Hydrolase Inhibitors ', ' Peptidase Inhibitors ', ' Endopeptidase Inhibitors ', ' Antiproteases ', ' tool ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Writing ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' user friendly software ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Documentation ', ' Communities ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' Outcome ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' treatment effect ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2009,468118,0.10874860009606249
"A Multi-Site Investigation into the Effect of HIV Clade on Neurocognitive Impairm    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 is one of the most genetically diverse pathogens on earth. In fact, some coding regions, such as envelope, can have more than 30% genetic difference between clades. The neurocognitive effects of clade B HIV-1 infection have been well characterized in the developed world; however, there continues to be controversy surronding the effect of non-clade B infection on the neurocognitive functioning. The overarching aims of the proposed study is to 1) characterize and compare the burden of HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) occurring among individuals living in Brazil, China, India, Romania and the United States and infected with CRF01_AE and clades B, C and F, and 2) evaluate the neurovirulent and neurotropic genotypic determinants between subtypes. Important research questions that remain unanswered include: How do the prevalence, nature and course of HAND in various parts of the world compare when analyzed by population and subtype? What specific viral genetic characteristics are associated with neurovirulence and seeding of the central nervous system (CNS)?    The current proposal is designed to systematically address these issues by: 1) determining the differential effect of HIV subtype on neurocognitive performance by measuring HAND using standardized measures in previously established cohorts in Brazil (clades B and C), China (CRF01_AE and clades B and C), India (clade C), Romania (clade F) and the United States (clade B), 2) determining viral genetic motifs from HIV RNA that are conserved during HAND by subtype and by study population by performing clade-typing of study participants by generating population based sequences of the env and tat coding regions from HIV RNA and DNA extracted from blood, and 3) determining viral genetic motifs from HIV RNA that are conserved during CNS compartmentalization between clades B and C by performing clonal sequencing of the env and tat coding regions from HIV RNA extracted from paired blood and CSF samples collected from participants with clade B or C infection in Brazil, India and the United States.

"Public HIV Drug Resistance Database    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV drug resistance data are critical for HIV drug resistance surveillance, antiretroviral drug design, and the management of persons infected with drug-resistant HIV. Three fundamental types of correlations form the basis of drug resistance knowledge: (1) Correlations between genotypic data with the treatments of persons from whom sequenced HIV-1 isolates have been obtained (genotype-treatment); (2) Correlations between genotype and in vitro drug susceptibility (genotype-phenotype); and (3) Correlations between genotype and the clinical response to a new treatment regimen (genotype-outcome). Accordingly our three plans are as follows: (1) To use phylogenetically-based statistical analysis of correlations between mutations in the targets of HIV therapy (genotype) and antiretroviral treatment to distinguish between drug- and non-drug- related HIV-1 evolution, to identify temporal and geographic patterns in the prevalence of drug resistance, and to identify the spread of viruses with particular patterns of drug-resistance mutations. (2) To use patterns of mutations in the targets of antiretroviral therapy, antiretroviral treatment data, and in vitro drug susceptibility results to help prioritize the clinical development of experimental antiretroviral compounds. (3) To us correlations between genotype-phenotype and genotype-clinical outcome to identify the treatment regimens most likely to be effective in persons with acquired or transmitted drug resistance. In order to accomplish these aims, we will expand the online publicly available Stanford HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database to represent, store, and analyze the diverse forms of data underlying drug resistance knowledge. Standardized protocols for exchanging data with the broad community of researchers studying HIV-1 drug resistance will be refined and validated.

"An Interactive Video Game for HIV Prevention in At-Risk Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Video games are ubiquitous, can improve health behavior, but have not been evaluated as a tool to promote protection from HIV transmission in minority early adolescents. A major challenge in HIV prevention for minority adolescents is capturing individuals in     their environment - meeting individuals ""where they live"". The current application combines proven HIV prevention strategies and an interactive video game platform that incorporates virtual environments and intelligent conversant virtual characters to address this challenge. Research demonstrates that adolescents who acquire new knowledge, skills and attitudes in a video game, and practice these skills in the game, are more likely to behave similarly in real life. Therefore, the goal of this application is to adapt existing software to develop and refine an interactive video game designed to decrease HIV risk by teaching minority adolescents sex, drug and alcohol negotiation and refusal skills. The game will be adapted with input from minority adolescents, and collaborators with expertise in positive youth development, social cognitive theory and self-efficacy, prospect theory and message framing, software and artificial intelligence development, and commercial game design. We will evaluate the efficacy of the game by conducting a randomized clinical trial in 330 minority youths, ages 9-14 years, attending an after-school and/or weekend youth program, who will be randomly assigned to play the interactive HIV prevention video game, ""Retro-Warriors"", or to play a commercial ""off-the-shelf"" video game. Subjects will play two sessions/week of their assigned game for four weeks. The primary outcome will be initiation of sexual activity, defined as the initiation of either vaginal or anal intercourse. Secondary outcomes include HIV risk behavior knowledge, social competency, self-efficacy, drug/alcohol use behaviors and overall risk-taking behaviors. We hypothesize that the experimental group will have lower rates of initiation of sexual activity and have higher knowledge scores at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months compared with the control group. We will also explore if selected baseline characteristics are associated with an improved response to the negotiation skills training intervention embedded in the interactive video game. Unique features of this intervention will include the use of virtual characters or avatars who can verbally respond to and interact with the player, a realistic virtual urban setting, the use of sex, drug/alcohol ""risk challenges"" that the subjects can practice repeatedly, the use of message framing according to prospect theory, a fun and engaging intervention that encourages repeated involvement, and the ability to track the players' choices and behaviors in the game. The successful implementation of this application will represent a paradigm shift, providing evidence for the role of interactive games as HIV/AIDS prevention in minority adolescents. Video game technology has the potential to expand the available vehicles for HIV prevention to the increasing number of electronic gaming platforms including the internet, personal digital assistants, and cell phones, thereby creating a new avenue for public health interventions.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research is designed to develop and test a video game that will teach minority adolescents how to avoid sex, drug and alcohol risk behaviors that can lead to HIV infection. The research goes beyond the use of a game for education and proposes to create an interactive world in which the game players can engage in ""role-playing"" to learn to avoid risky behaviors. This application has far-reaching implications including the potential for this technology to ""travel"" with the player, i.e., the player ultimately can do sessions from home, on a console, a cell phone, or a personal digital assistant. There are international implications given that access to the internet is growing in developing countries and these technologies could be transferred to adolescents in countries experiencing a growing HIV epidemic but who have limited access to targeted risk reduction strategies. If successful, the results of this research will be video game technology that can improve individual and public health and decrease HIV transmission.           Project Narrative This research is designed to develop and test a video game that will teach minority adolescents how to avoid sex, drug and alcohol risk behaviors that can lead to HIV infection.

"NeuroAIDS in India    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NeuroAIDS in India Viral and host factors, as well as comorbidities, play key roles in determining susceptibility to the neurologic complications associated with HIV infection. Most studies of HIV-related neurocognitive impairment have been conducted in Western countries, where HIV clade B predominates. Worldwide, however, clade C is much more common and recent virologic studies suggest that its neurovirulence may differ from clade B. Approximately 5 million individuals are infected with HIV in India, the vast majority with clade C virus. In the present study we will address the following aims within an Indian cohort: 1) to determine the prevalence and nature of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (HNCI) in HIV-infected individuals who are not on antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, 2) to determine the impact of newly-initiated ARV treatment on cognitive functioning, 3) to assess the viral (env, tat) genetics associated with HNCI, and 4) to determine the relationship between HNCI and host immunogenetic factors (i.e., genotype MCP-1, CCL3L1 copy number, RANTES and polymorphisms in CCR5/CCR2 to define CCR5 haplotypes). Building upon collaboration between the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Center (HNRC) in the U.S. and the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) in Pune, India, we propose to examine 300 HIV+ individuals prior to initiation of ARVs in linked studies (HPTN 052, India National AIDS Control Organization program) and follow them annually thereafter. We will also enroll an HIV seronegative comparison group in order to establish neuropsychological norms for determining impairment in individual HIV+ persons. The feasibility of this study has been demonstrated by a pilot study in which we created Marathi-translated instruments, trained India personnel, and examined 60 participants using methods originally developed at the HNRC but adapted to India. This project will potentially a) lead to improved understanding of the characteristics and correlates of neurologic complications of clade C HIV infection in India and b) enhance existing clinical and scientific expertise in India via technology transfer in the areas of cognitive assessments, genomics, and biomarker assays.           ",NeuroAIDS in India,7637386,R01MH078748,"['base ', ' improved

"Targeted Empirical Super Learning in HIV Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this project is to study and extend a general statistical methodology, called Targeted Empirical Learning, which includes a recently developed Targeted Maximum Likelihood methodology. The fundamental theoretical underpinnings of this new and unified approach to statistical learning have been developed and we propose to expand Targeted Empirical Learning into a practical product that can be applied to pressing scientific questions. Building on long-standing collaborations with leading scientists in the areas of clinical AIDS research, we will use this novel methodology to address research questions concerning HIV. Given observed data consisting of a realization of n independently and identically distributed random variables, Targeted Empirical Learning employs the following elements: i) defining the parameter of interest; 2) modeling the parameter of interest, leaving the nuisance parameters unspecified or only including truly known modeling assumptions; 3) developing targeted robust and highly efficient (maximum likelihood) estimators of the parameter of interest. The methodology relies on unified cross- validation to choose between competitive estimators indexed by, for example, choices of sieves parameterizations, algorithms, and/or dimension reductions (in particular for the nuisance parameters). Importantly, the cross-validation criterion employed evaluates the performance of these candidate estimators with respect to the parameter of interest. Specific applications to be addressed include the following: i) develop models and corresponding targeted empirical learners of optimal individualized treatment rules for treating HIV-infected patients, 2) estimate measures of variable importance/causal effects for mutations in the HIV virus for predicting clinical response to drug combinations; 3) estimate causal effects of adherence profiles on virologic suppression for HIV-infected patients. We will further develop and apply a novel resampling-based multiple testing methodology to properly address our simultaneous testing and estimation of many scientific parameters of interest.           ",Targeted Empirical Super Learning in HIV Research,7883449,R01AI074345,"['Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Observational Study ', ' Validation ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Genotype ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Hand ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Algorithms ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' In Vitro ', ' indexing ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Disease Progression ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nucleosides ', ' Patients ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Protease Inhibitor ', ' Proteinase Inhibitors ', ' Protease Antagonists ', ' Peptide Peptidohydrolase Inhibitors ', ' Peptide Hydrolase Inhibitors ', ' Peptidase Inhibitors ', ' Endopeptidase Inhibitors ', ' Antiproteases ', ' tool ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Writing ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' user friendly software ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Documentation ', ' Communities ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' Outcome ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' treatment effect ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' Regimen ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Drug resistance ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2010,473194,0.10874860009606249
"Public HIV Drug Resistance Database    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV drug resistance data are critical for HIV drug resistance surveillance, antiretroviral drug design, and the management of persons infected with drug-resistant HIV. Three fundamental types of correlations form the basis of drug resistance knowledge: (1) Correlations between genotypic data with the treatments of persons from whom sequenced HIV-1 isolates have been obtained (genotype-treatment); (2) Correlations between genotype and in vitro drug susceptibility (genotype-phenotype); and (3) Correlations between genotype and the clinical response to a new treatment regimen (genotype-outcome). Accordingly our three plans are as follows: (1) To use phylogenetically-based statistical analysis of correlations between mutations in the targets of HIV therapy (genotype) and antiretroviral treatment to distinguish between drug- and non-drug- related HIV-1 evolution, to identify temporal and geographic patterns in the prevalence of drug resistance, and to identify the spread of viruses with particular patterns of drug-resistance mutations. (2) To use patterns of mutations in the targets of antiretroviral therapy, antiretroviral treatment data, and in vitro drug susceptibility results to help prioritize the clinical development of experimental antiretroviral compounds. (3) To us correlations between genotype-phenotype and genotype-clinical outcome to identify the treatment regimens most likely to be effective in persons with acquired or transmitted drug resistance. In order to accomplish these aims, we will expand the online publicly available Stanford HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database to represent, store, and analyze the diverse forms of data underlying drug resistance knowledge. Standardized protocols for exchanging data with the broad community of researchers studying HIV-1 drug resistance will be refined and validated. Improved methods for representing published drug resistance data, performing temporal queries and knowledge discovery, and for analyzing genotypic resistance data in a phylogenetic context will be implemented. This proposal is also the start of a three-way collaboration between Stanford University, the University College of London (UCL), and Oxford University.

"A Multi-Site Investigation into the Effect of HIV Clade on Neurocognitive Impairm    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 is one of the most genetically diverse pathogens on earth. In fact, some coding regions, such as envelope, can have more than 30% genetic difference between clades. The neurocognitive effects of clade B HIV-1 infection have been well characterized in the developed world; however, there continues to be controversy surronding the effect of non-clade B infection on the neurocognitive functioning. The overarching aims of the proposed study is to 1) characterize and compare the burden of HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) occurring among individuals living in Brazil, China, India, Romania and the United States and infected with CRF01_AE and clades B, C and F, and 2) evaluate the neurovirulent and neurotropic genotypic determinants between subtypes. Important research questions that remain unanswered include: How do the prevalence, nature and course of HAND in various parts of the world compare when analyzed by population and subtype? What specific viral genetic characteristics are associated with neurovirulence and seeding of the central nervous system (CNS)?    The current proposal is designed to systematically address these issues by: 1) determining the differential effect of HIV subtype on neurocognitive performance by measuring HAND using standardized measures in previously established cohorts in Brazil (clades B and C), China (CRF01_AE and clades B and C), India (clade C), Romania (clade F) and the United States (clade B), 2) determining viral genetic motifs from HIV RNA that are conserved during HAND by subtype and by study population by performing clade-typing of study participants by generating population based sequences of the env and tat coding regions from HIV RNA and DNA extracted from blood, and 3) determining viral genetic motifs from HIV RNA that are conserved during CNS compartmentalization between clades B and C by performing clonal sequencing of the env and tat coding regions from HIV RNA extracted from paired blood and CSF samples collected from participants with clade B or C infection in Brazil, India and the United States. The comparison of the burden of HAND between groups infected with different HIV clades requires standardized procedures for the measurement of HAND within and across populations. Investigations into clade-specific genotypic determinants of HIV neuropathogenesis and neurotropism requires: 1) well-characterized study populations and biologic samples from study participants, 2) standardization of measurements of neurocognitive functioning, 3) high quality HIV RNA sequencing capability in all research study settings, 4) secure and reliable data management and communication capabilities for sequence and study data between participating sites, and 5) expertise in state-of- the-art genotypic analysis. Our group has demonstrated experience in each of these areas.          ",A Multi-Site Investigation into the Effect of HIV Clade on Neurocognitive Impairm,7917337,R01MH083552,"['Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Genetic ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Romania ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Standardization ', ' Arts ', ' United States ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Investigation ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Base Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Viral ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' virus genetics ', ' Viral Genetics ', ' cohort ', ' genetic element ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Brazil ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Population Study ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Measures ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' China ', ' Mainland China ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' disorder subtype ', ' disease subtype ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Communication ', ' Genetic Determinism ', ' genetic determinant ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' neurovirulence ', ' neurotropic ', ' population based ', ' standardize measure ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Secure ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Virology ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' computational analysis ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Neuropathogenesis ', ' Neurotropism ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' RNA Sequences ', ' Viral Genes ', ' Genome ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' AIDS Dementia Complex ', ' HIV-related dementia ', ' HIV-Associated Cognitive Motor Complex ', ' HIV-1 dementia ', ' HIV-1 associated dementia ', ' HIV associated dementia ', ' HIV Dementia ', ' Dementia in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease ', ' Dementia associated with AIDS ', ' Dementia Due to HIV Disease ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome related dementia ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Dementia Complex ', ' AIDS-related dementia ', ' AIDS-Related Dementia Complex ', ' AIDS with dementia ', ' AIDS Dementia ', ' Cercopithecine Herpesvirus 1 ', ' Simian Herpesvirus ', ' Monkey B Virus ', ' Herpesvirus simiae ', ' Herpesvirus B ', ' Herpesvirus 1 (alpha), Cercopithecine ', ' Herpes simiae ', ' Herpes Virus B ', ' Cercopithecid herpesvirus 1 ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV-1 ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Incidence ', ' India ', ' Infection ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2010,668298,0.2740642038762924
"NeuroAIDS in India    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NeuroAIDS in India Viral and host factors, as well as comorbidities, play key roles in determining susceptibility to the neurologic complications associated with HIV infection. Most studies of HIV-related neurocognitive impairment have been conducted in Western countries, where HIV clade B predominates. Worldwide, however, clade C is much more common and recent virologic studies suggest that its neurovirulence may differ from clade B. Approximately 5 million individuals are infected with HIV in India, the vast majority with clade C virus. In the present study we will address the following aims within an Indian cohort: 1) to determine the prevalence and nature of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (HNCI) in HIV-infected individuals who are not on antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, 2) to determine the impact of newly-initiated ARV treatment on cognitive functioning, 3) to assess the viral (env, tat) genetics associated with HNCI, and 4) to determine the relationship between HNCI and host immunogenetic factors (i.e., genotype MCP-1, CCL3L1 copy number, RANTES and polymorphisms in CCR5/CCR2 to define CCR5 haplotypes). Building upon collaboration between the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Center (HNRC) in the U.S. and the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) in Pune, India, we propose to examine 300 HIV+ individuals prior to initiation of ARVs in linked studies (HPTN 052, India National AIDS Control Organization program) and follow them annually thereafter. We will also enroll an HIV seronegative comparison group in order to establish neuropsychological norms for determining impairment in individual HIV+ persons. The feasibility of this study has been demonstrated by a pilot study in which we created Marathi-translated instruments, trained India personnel, and examined 60 participants using methods originally developed at the HNRC but adapted to India. This project will potentially a) lead to improved understanding of the characteristics and correlates of neurologic complications of clade C HIV infection in India and b) enhance existing clinical and scientific expertise in India via technology transfer in the areas of cognitive assessments, genomics, and biomarker assays.           ",NeuroAIDS in India,7848282,R01MH078748,"['Cysteine ', '

"An Interactive Video Game for HIV Prevention in At-Risk Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Video games are ubiquitous, can improve health behavior, but have not been evaluated as a tool to promote protection from HIV transmission in minority early adolescents. A major challenge in HIV prevention for minority adolescents is capturing individuals in     their environment - meeting individuals ""where they live"". The current application combines proven HIV prevention strategies and an interactive video game platform that incorporates virtual environments and intelligent conversant virtual characters to address this challenge. Research demonstrates that adolescents who acquire new knowledge, skills and attitudes in a video game, and practice these skills in the game, are more likely to behave similarly in real life. Therefore, the goal of this application is to adapt existing software to develop and refine an interactive video game designed to decrease HIV risk by teaching minority adolescents sex, drug and alcohol negotiation and refusal skills. The game will be adapted with input from minority adolescents, and collaborators with expertise in positive youth development, social cognitive theory and self-efficacy, prospect theory and message framing, software and artificial intelligence development, and commercial game design. We will evaluate the efficacy of the game by conducting a randomized clinical trial in 330 minority youths, ages 9-14 years, attending an after-school and/or weekend youth program, who will be randomly assigned to play the interactive HIV prevention video game, ""Retro-Warriors"", or to play a commercial ""off-the-shelf"" video game. Subjects will play two sessions/week of their assigned game for four weeks. The primary outcome will be initiation of sexual activity, defined as the initiation of either vaginal or anal intercourse. Secondary outcomes include HIV risk behavior knowledge, social competency, self-efficacy, drug/alcohol use behaviors and overall risk-taking behaviors. We hypothesize that the experimental group will have lower rates of initiation of sexual activity and have higher knowledge scores at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months compared with the control group. We will also explore if selected baseline characteristics are associated with an improved response to the negotiation skills training intervention embedded in the interactive video game. Unique features of this intervention will include the use of virtual characters or avatars who can verbally respond to and interact with the player, a realistic virtual urban setting, the use of sex, drug/alcohol ""risk challenges"" that the subjects can practice repeatedly, the use of message framing according to prospect theory, a fun and engaging intervention that encourages repeated involvement, and the ability to track the players' choices and behaviors in the game. The successful implementation of this application will represent a paradigm shift, providing evidence for the role of interactive games as HIV/AIDS prevention in minority adolescents. Video game technology has the potential to expand the available vehicles for HIV prevention to the increasing number of electronic gaming platforms including the internet, personal digital assistants, and cell phones, thereby creating a new avenue for public health interventions.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research is designed to develop and test a video game that will teach minority adolescents how to avoid sex, drug and alcohol risk behaviors that can lead to HIV infection. The research goes beyond the use of a game for education and proposes to create an interactive world in which the game players can engage in ""role-playing"" to learn to avoid risky behaviors. This application has far-reaching implications including the potential for this technology to ""travel"" with the player, i.e., the player ultimately can do sessions from home, on a console, a cell phone, or a personal digital assistant. There are international implications given that access to the internet is growing in developing countries and these technologies could be transferred to adolescents in countries experiencing a growing HIV epidemic but who have limited access to targeted risk reduction strategies. If successful, the results of this research will be video game technology that can improve individual and public health and decrease HIV transmission.           Project Narrative This research is designed to develop and test a video game that will teach minority adolescents how to avoid sex, drug and alcohol risk behaviors that can lead to HIV infection.

"Targeted Empirical Super Learning in HIV Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this project is to study and extend a general statistical methodology, called Targeted Empirical Learning, which includes a recently developed Targeted Maximum Likelihood methodology. The fundamental theoretical underpinnings of this new and unified approach to statistical learning have been developed and we propose to expand Targeted Empirical Learning into a practical product that can be applied to pressing scientific questions. Building on long-standing collaborations with leading scientists in the areas of clinical AIDS research, we will use this novel methodology to address research questions concerning HIV. Given observed data consisting of a realization of n independently and identically distributed random variables, Targeted Empirical Learning employs the following elements: i) defining the parameter of interest; 2) modeling the parameter of interest, leaving the nuisance parameters unspecified or only including truly known modeling assumptions; 3) developing targeted robust and highly efficient (maximum likelihood) estimators of the parameter of interest. The methodology relies on unified cross- validation to choose between competitive estimators indexed by, for example, choices of sieves parameterizations, algorithms, and/or dimension reductions (in particular for the nuisance parameters). Importantly, the cross-validation criterion employed evaluates the performance of these candidate estimators with respect to the parameter of interest. Specific applications to be addressed include the following: i) develop models and corresponding targeted empirical learners of optimal individualized treatment rules for treating HIV-infected patients, 2) estimate measures of variable importance/causal effects for mutations in the HIV virus for predicting clinical response to drug combinations; 3) estimate causal effects of adherence profiles on virologic suppression for HIV-infected patients. We will further develop and apply a novel resampling-based multiple testing methodology to properly address our simultaneous testing and estimation of many scientific parameters of interest.           ",Targeted Empirical Super Learning in HIV Research,8103011,R01AI074345,"['Public Health Schools ', ' user-friendly ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' treatment effect ', ' Protease Inhibitor ', ' Proteinase Inhibitors ', ' Protease Antagonists ', ' Peptide Peptidohydrolase Inhibitors ', ' Peptide Hydrolase Inhibitors ', ' Peptidase Inhibitors ', ' Endopeptidase Inhibitors ', ' Antiproteases ', ' Documentation ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' open source ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' Communities ', ' Left ', ' Drug resistance ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Observational Study ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Writing ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Learning ', ' Algorithms ', ' Intention ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Viral ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Health Insurance ', ' density ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Genotype ', ' Clinical ', ' Time ', ' interest ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Categories ', ' Scientist ', ' Elements ', ' Regimen ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' indexing ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Mediating ', ' Validation ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Testing ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Dimensions ', ' Future ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Modeling ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Patients ', ' Collaborations ', ' base ', ' novel ', ' Area ', ' Research ', ' Techniques ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Outcome ', ' Data ', ' Pattern ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' programs ', ' Address ', ' Measures ', ' response ', ' Affect ', ' Performance ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' In Vitro ', ' tool ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' user friendly software ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2011,468981,0.10874860009606249
"Long Term Effects of Chronic HIV Infection on the Developing Brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R01 application builds upon a successful R21 grant that examined a cohort of Romanian adolescents and young adults who are long-term HIV survivors and who, despite over a decade of effective treatment, still demonstrate neuropsychological impairments (approx. 50% of subjects). The key feature of the next stage of this study is that these late teens and early 20s HIV+ cases, who were parenterally infected a long time ago, and for whom we have extensive longitudinal biological and treatment information, may experience altered maturation of the brain, with possible neurocognitive and social cognition sequelae. Prior to 1989, only 13 AIDS cases from Romania had been reported to the WHO, while by the end of 1990, 1168 cases were reported, of which 1094 were in children less than 13 years of age. Genetic characterization of the HIV circulating in these institutions revealed that all the children were infected with HIV clade F1  SA#1: Study the neuromedical (NM) characteristics of a long-term surviving cohort of HIV+ patients on HAART and compare them to the HAND features. We will examine the relationship between past and present NM data, including CD4 counts, VL, HAART and HAND-associated elements like: NP impairment, daily functioning, risk behavior, treatment adherence and psychiatric comorbidities.  SA#2: Study the viral genetic factors associated with HAND in long-term survivors infected with clade F since early childhood. We will sequence and test in vitro the neurotropic potential of patient viral isolates and identify conserved viral genetic elements ('brain signature sequences') in the env (C2-V3) coding region, from HIV DNA extracted from the CSF and PBMC of subjects with or without HAND. Our study in the well-characterized Romanian cohort offers a unique opportunity to make prognostic correlations between host immune, viral, treatment, comorbid factors, and HAND in young adults who are living with HIV since childhood, most often being infected during the earliest stages of brain development. As these individuals mature, it will be important to understand the implications of neurocognitive impairment on their future behaviors.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Millions of patients are at risk of developing HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). We have identified a unique patient cohort that could help in deciphering the risk factors associated with HAND.

"A Multi-Site Investigation into the Effect of HIV Clade on Neurocognitive Impairm    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 is one of the most genetically diverse pathogens on earth. In fact, some coding regions, such as envelope, can have more than 30% genetic difference between clades. The neurocognitive effects of clade B HIV-1 infection have been well characterized in the developed world; however, there continues to be controversy surronding the effect of non-clade B infection on the neurocognitive functioning. The overarching aims of the proposed study is to 1) characterize and compare the burden of HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) occurring among individuals living in Brazil, China, India, Romania and the United States and infected with CRF01_AE and clades B, C and F, and 2) evaluate the neurovirulent and neurotropic genotypic determinants between subtypes. Important research questions that remain unanswered include: How do the prevalence, nature and course of HAND in various parts of the world compare when analyzed by population and subtype? What specific viral genetic characteristics are associated with neurovirulence and seeding of the central nervous system (CNS)?    The current proposal is designed to systematically address these issues by: 1) determining the differential effect of HIV subtype on neurocognitive performance by measuring HAND using standardized measures in previously established cohorts in Brazil (clades B and C), China (CRF01_AE and clades B and C), India (clade C), Romania (clade F) and the United States (clade B), 2) determining viral genetic motifs from HIV RNA that are conserved during HAND by subtype and by study population by performing clade-typing of study participants by generating population based sequences of the env and tat coding regions from HIV RNA and DNA extracted from blood, and 3) determining viral genetic motifs from HIV RNA that are conserved during CNS compartmentalization between clades B and C by performing clonal sequencing of the env and tat coding regions from HIV RNA extracted from paired blood and CSF samples collected from participants with clade B or C infection in Brazil, India and the United States. The comparison of the burden of HAND between groups infected with different HIV clades requires standardized procedures for the measurement of HAND within and across populations. Investigations into clade-specific genotypic determinants of HIV neuropathogenesis and neurotropism requires: 1) well-characterized study populations and biologic samples from study participants, 2) standardization of measurements of neurocognitive functioning, 3) high quality HIV RNA sequencing capability in all research study settings, 4) secure and reliable data management and communication capabilities for sequence and study data between participating sites, and 5) expertise in state-of- the-art genotypic analysis.

"An Interactive Video Game for HIV Prevention in At-Risk Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Video games are ubiquitous, can improve health behavior, but have not been evaluated as a tool to promote protection from HIV transmission in minority early adolescents. A major challenge in HIV prevention for minority adolescents is capturing individuals in     their environment - meeting individuals ""where they live"". The current application combines proven HIV prevention strategies and an interactive video game platform that incorporates virtual environments and intelligent conversant virtual characters to address this challenge. Research demonstrates that adolescents who acquire new knowledge, skills and attitudes in a video game, and practice these skills in the game, are more likely to behave similarly in real life. Therefore, the goal of this application is to adapt existing software to develop and refine an interactive video game designed to decrease HIV risk by teaching minority adolescents sex, drug and alcohol negotiation and refusal skills. The game will be adapted with input from minority adolescents, and collaborators with expertise in positive youth development, social cognitive theory and self-efficacy, prospect theory and message framing, software and artificial intelligence development, and commercial game design. We will evaluate the efficacy of the game by conducting a randomized clinical trial in 330 minority youths, ages 9-14 years, attending an after-school and/or weekend youth program, who will be randomly assigned to play the interactive HIV prevention video game, ""Retro-Warriors"", or to play a commercial ""off-the-shelf"" video game. Subjects will play two sessions/week of their assigned game for four weeks. The primary outcome will be initiation of sexual activity, defined as the initiation of either vaginal or anal intercourse. Secondary outcomes include HIV risk behavior knowledge, social competency, self-efficacy, drug/alcohol use behaviors and overall risk-taking behaviors. We hypothesize that the experimental group will have lower rates of initiation of sexual activity and have higher knowledge scores at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months compared with the control group. We will also explore if selected baseline characteristics are associated with an improved response to the negotiation skills training intervention embedded in the interactive video game. Unique features of this intervention will include the use of virtual characters or avatars who can verbally respond to and interact with the player, a realistic virtual urban setting, the use of sex, drug/alcohol ""risk challenges"" that the subjects can practice repeatedly, the use of message framing according to prospect theory, a fun and engaging intervention that encourages repeated involvement, and the ability to track the players' choices and behaviors in the game. The successful implementation of this application will represent a paradigm shift, providing evidence for the role of interactive games as HIV/AIDS prevention in minority adolescents.

"NeuroAIDS in India    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NeuroAIDS in India Viral and host factors, as well as comorbidities, play key roles in determining susceptibility to the neurologic complications associated with HIV infection. Most studies of HIV-related neurocognitive impairment have been conducted in Western countries, where HIV clade B predominates. Worldwide, however, clade C is much more common and recent virologic studies suggest that its neurovirulence may differ from clade B. Approximately 5 million individuals are infected with HIV in India, the vast majority with clade C virus. In the present study we will address the following aims within an Indian cohort: 1) to determine the prevalence and nature of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (HNCI) in HIV-infected individuals who are not on antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, 2) to determine the impact of newly-initiated ARV treatment on cognitive functioning, 3) to assess the viral (env, tat) genetics associated with HNCI, and 4) to determine the relationship between HNCI and host immunogenetic factors (i.e., genotype MCP-1, CCL3L1 copy number, RANTES and polymorphisms in CCR5/CCR2 to define CCR5 haplotypes). Building upon collaboration between the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Center (HNRC) in the U.S. and the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) in Pune, India, we propose to examine 300 HIV+ individuals prior to initiation of ARVs in linked studies (HPTN 052, India National AIDS Control Organization program) and follow them annually thereafter. We will also enroll an HIV seronegative comparison group in order to establish neuropsychological norms for determining impairment in individual HIV+ persons. The feasibility of this study has been demonstrated by a pilot study in which we created Marathi-translated instruments, trained India personnel, and examined 60 participants using methods originally developed at the HNRC but adapted to India. This project will potentially a) lead to improved understanding of the characteristics and correlates of neurologic complications of clade C HIV infection in India and b) enhance existing clinical and scientific expertise in India via technology transfer in the areas of cognitive assessments, genomics, and biomarker assays.           ",NeuroAIDS in India,8071115,R01MH078748,"['cognitive function

"High throughput high resolution profiling of antibody specificities of polyclonal     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV elicits the production of antibodies in the infected individual. Whereas for most, this response is highly specific for the particular viral isolate of infection, there are some individuals that mount broadly cross neutralizing antibodies that appear to keep the virus in check. It is assumed that such cross neutralizing activity is central i combating AIDS and would be a necessary attribute of a prophylactic AIDS vaccine. Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to critically analyze the antibody response towards HIV and profile the specificities correlated with virus neutralization. Current serological methods, however, are tedious, laborious and of unsatisfactory resolution, classifying antibody specificities to gross chunks of the HIV envelope. Here we propose a novel and much improved technological platform that generates exceptionally high resolution profiles of the antibody specificities of polyclonal serum with relative ease, low cost and at high throughput. The essence of the technology is the combination of two new methods; a phage display library of a comprehensive array of HIV envelope peptides/domains ranging in length from 50 to 300 amino acids, and a unique vector system that converts phage display compatible with second generation DNA cyclic sequencing. Together, this methodology, coined Deep Panning of Domain Scan libraries, enables one to analyze the complete antibody repertoire of selected polyclonal sera. The data output generated consists of hundreds of thousands of affinity isolated peptides corresponding to HIV envelope segments. In this study feasibility of the methods and evaluation of their utility and productivity will be tested using a panel of >400 well characterize serum samples of HIV infected individuals that range in their neutralizing capacity from non-existent/weak to extraordinarily potent (top 2% of the collection). Selected sera will be subjected to Deep Panning and the data sets to be generated will be classified implementing machine learning computational methods. These will produce a profile of those epitopes that best correlate with HIV neutralization. It is proposed that this information will be extremely useful fo our understanding of mechanisms of HIV neutralization and as guides to rational vaccine design. Moreover, the proof of feasibility in this pilot study will serve as the basis for more elaborate and comprehensive studies targeted to better understand HIV correlates of immunity, disease progression and prevention of AIDS.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A comprehensive panel of polyclonal sera of HIV infected individuals will be analyzed by Deep Panning of Domain Scan libraries, a novel methodology that generates high resolution profiles of antibody specificities. Specific focus will be on elucidation of the correlates of HIV neutralization and association of this activity to specific epitopes of the viral envelope. The discovery of these correlates of virus neutralization will be useful for rational design of AIDS vaccines and better understanding of disease progression and prevention.              A comprehensive panel of polyclonal sera of HIV infected individuals will be analyzed by Deep Panning of Domain Scan libraries, a novel methodology that generates high resolution profiles of antibody specificities.

"A Multi-Site Investigation into the Effect of HIV Clade on Neurocognition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 is one of the most genetically diverse pathogens on earth. In fact, some coding regions, such as envelope, can have more than 30% genetic difference between clades. The neurocognitive effects of clade B HIV-1 infection have been well characterized in the developed world; however, there continues to be controversy surronding the effect of non-clade B infection on the neurocognitive functioning. The overarching aims of the proposed study is to 1) characterize and compare the burden of HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) occurring among individuals living in Brazil, China, India, Romania and the United States and infected with CRF01_AE and clades B, C and F, and 2) evaluate the neurovirulent and neurotropic genotypic determinants between subtypes. Important research questions that remain unanswered include: How do the prevalence, nature and course of HAND in various parts of the world compare when analyzed by population and subtype? What specific viral genetic characteristics are associated with neurovirulence and seeding of the central nervous system (CNS)?    The current proposal is designed to systematically address these issues by: 1) determining the differential effect of HIV subtype on neurocognitive performance by measuring HAND using standardized measures in previously established cohorts in Brazil (clades B and C), China (CRF01_AE and clades B and C), India (clade C), Romania (clade F) and the United States (clade B), 2) determining viral genetic motifs from HIV RNA that are conserved during HAND by subtype and by study population by performing clade-typing of study participants by generating population based sequences of the env and tat coding regions from HIV RNA and DNA extracted from blood, and 3) determining viral genetic motifs from HIV RNA that are conserved during CNS compartmentalization between clades B and C by performing clonal sequencing of the env and tat coding regions from HIV RNA extracted from paired blood and CSF samples collected from participants with clade B or C infection in Brazil, India and the United States. The comparison of the burden of HAND between groups infected with different HIV clades requires standardized procedures for the measurement of HAND within and across populations. Investigations into clade-specific genotypic determinants of HIV neuropathogenesis and neurotropism requires: 1) well-characterized study populations and biologic samples from study participants, 2) standardization of measurements of neurocognitive functioning, 3) high quality HIV RNA sequencing capability in all research study settings, 4) secure and reliable data management and communication capabilities for sequence and study data between participating sites, and 5) expertise in state-of- the-art genotypic analysis. Our group has demonstrated experience in each of these areas.

"Predicting Brain Changes in HIV/AIDS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In affluent countries where combination anti-retroviral therapy (CART) is widely used, life expectancy with HIV has increased well beyond 10 years, but this has greatly increased the number of people living with HIV/AIDS. 40 million people are now at risk for progressive HIV-related damage to the brain (Navia 2011), and 40% show some neurological or cognitive impairment. Building on our recent discoveries and innovations in MRI and diffusion tensor imaging, our project charts the dynamics of HIV disease in the brain, revealing factors that predict clinical decline and brain decline. By analyzing data from the HIVNC (HIV Neuroimaging Consortium) cohort (218 HIV+ subjects scanned longitudinally with MRI every 26-32 weeks for 3 years; 900 scans), we will use our sensitive image analysis method, tensor-based morphometry to (1) map rates of brain tissue loss over time, determining which brain systems lose tissue fastest; (2) relate these loss patterns to neurocognitive impairment (NCI); and (3) determine which host and disease-related factors, at baseline, predict higher atrophic rates over the 3-year follow-up interval. To deeply probe the causes of dysfunction, we will use whole-brain tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging in 267 subjects to determine where HIV+ patients have reduced fiber integrity. We will use each patient's DTI scan to compute a whole-brain connection matrix, based on a state-of-the-art whole-brain tractography method we developed. We will combine the best neuroimaging measures from Aims 1 and 2 into our support vector machine method to predict (1) future rates of atrophy, and (2) cognitive decline over the 3-year follow-up. With our best predictors of decline from Aims 1 and 2, we will predict which HIV+ patients will show imminent decline. We will estimate the sample sizes needed for a neuroimaging-based drug trial to detect a 5%, 10%, or 25% slowing in the rate of atrophy, and the same percents of slowing in the rate of cognitive decline. We will test whether our predictors generalize to the large, independent Charter and Miriam datasets beyond HIVNC (see Support Letters from Drs. Igor Grant and Ron Cohen), and when used by our many HIV research collaborators now using our methods; see Pilot Data). As shown in new pilot data, we assess how imaging protocol differences affect the measures; our innovations to reduce scan protocol confounds (e.g., adjusted FA) will guide selection of the most robust predictors. We will evaluate how useful these new measures are for predicting cognitive decline, and boosting power in an antiretroviral drug trial. In other words, to what extent can a DTI scan, and an MRI-based map of atrophy, help to make clinical predictions of imminent cognitive impairment? Can they help select a sample for a drug trial? Our activities will make clinical trial design more efficient by selecting subjects with greater potential to respond t future therapies. As always, we will disseminate our methods to both experts and trainees in medicine, neuroscience, engineering, and to our network of over 100 collaborating labs (including two national HIV consortia: HIVNC, CHARTER, and the Miriam HIV cohort), to accelerate their work.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Building on our recent discoveries, this project greatly advances our ability to map, and predict, brain changes in people living with HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS is perhaps the greatest threat to public health worldwide in the 21st century. 40 million people are HIV-infected - a shocking 1 out of every 100 people aged 18-45 - and 40% have some neurological or cognitive impairment. Our work offers 3 immediate public health consequences: (1) new methods to predict whether a person with HIV/AIDS will show imminent brain decline; (2) enhancing basic neuroscience, identifying brain circuits disrupted by the virus, and (3) a clear method to boost power for clinical trials of drugs to treat the brain in the millios of people now living with HIV/AIDS.              Building on our recent discoveries, this project greatly advances our ability to map, and predict, brain changes in people living with HIV/AIDS.

"Long Term Effects of Chronic HIV Infection on the Developing Brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R01 application builds upon a successful R21 grant that examined a cohort of Romanian adolescents and young adults who are long-term HIV survivors and who, despite over a decade of effective treatment, still demonstrate neuropsychological impairments (approx. 50% of subjects). The key feature of the next stage of this study is that these late teens and early 20s HIV+ cases, who were parenterally infected a long time ago, and for whom we have extensive longitudinal biological and treatment information, may experience altered maturation of the brain, with possible neurocognitive and social cognition sequelae. Prior to 1989, only 13 AIDS cases from Romania had been reported to the WHO, while by the end of 1990, 1168 cases were reported, of which 1094 were in children less than 13 years of age. Genetic characterization of the HIV circulating in these institutions revealed that all the children were infected with HIV clade F1  SA#1: Study the neuromedical (NM) characteristics of a long-term surviving cohort of HIV+ patients on HAART and compare them to the HAND features. We will examine the relationship between past and present NM data, including CD4 counts, VL, HAART and HAND-associated elements like: NP impairment, daily functioning, risk behavior, treatment adherence and psychiatric comorbidities.  SA#2: Study the viral genetic factors associated with HAND in long-term survivors infected with clade F since early childhood. We will sequence and test in vitro the neurotropic potential of patient viral isolates and identify conserved viral genetic elements ('brain signature sequences') in the env (C2-V3) coding region, from HIV DNA extracted from the CSF and PBMC of subjects with or without HAND. Our study in the well-characterized Romanian cohort offers a unique opportunity to make prognostic correlations between host immune, viral, treatment, comorbid factors, and HAND in young adults who are living with HIV since childhood, most often being infected during the earliest stages of brain development. As these individuals mature, it will be important to understand the implications of neurocognitive impairment on their future behaviors.        Millions of patients are at risk of developing HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). We have identified a unique patient cohort that could help in deciphering the risk factors associated with HAND. The overarching hypothesis is that HAND will continue to be prevalent in the long term surviving young adults on HAART and it will have a significant impact on their lives.

"High throughput high resolution profiling of antibody specificities of polyclonal     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV elicits the production of antibodies in the infected individual. Whereas for most, this response is highly specific for the particular viral isolate of infection, there are some individuals that mount broadly cross neutralizing antibodies that appear to keep the virus in check. It is assumed that such cross neutralizing activity is central i combating AIDS and would be a necessary attribute of a prophylactic AIDS vaccine. Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to critically analyze the antibody response towards HIV and profile the specificities correlated with virus neutralization. Current serological methods, however, are tedious, laborious and of unsatisfactory resolution, classifying antibody specificities to gross chunks of the HIV envelope. Here we propose a novel and much improved technological platform that generates exceptionally high resolution profiles of the antibody specificities of polyclonal serum with relative ease, low cost and at high throughput. The essence of the technology is the combination of two new methods; a phage display library of a comprehensive array of HIV envelope peptides/domains ranging in length from 50 to 300 amino acids, and a unique vector system that converts phage display compatible with second generation DNA cyclic sequencing. Together, this methodology, coined Deep Panning of Domain Scan libraries, enables one to analyze the complete antibody repertoire of selected polyclonal sera. The data output generated consists of hundreds of thousands of affinity isolated peptides corresponding to HIV envelope segments. In this study feasibility of the methods and evaluation of their utility and productivity will be tested using a panel of >400 well characterize serum samples of HIV infected individuals that range in their neutralizing capacity from non-existent/weak to extraordinarily potent (top 2% of the collection). Selected sera will be subjected to Deep Panning and the data sets to be generated will be classified implementing machine learning computational methods. These will produce a profile of those epitopes that best correlate with HIV neutralization. It is proposed that this information will be extremely useful fo our understanding of mechanisms of HIV neutralization and as guides to rational vaccine design. Moreover, the proof of feasibility in this pilot study will serve as the basis for more elaborate and comprehensive studies targeted to better understand HIV correlates of immunity, disease progression and prevention of AIDS.          A comprehensive panel of polyclonal sera of HIV infected individuals will be analyzed by Deep Panning of Domain Scan libraries, a novel methodology that generates high resolution profiles of antibody specificities. Specific focus will be on elucidation of the correlates of HIV neutralization and association of this activity to specific epitopes of the viral envelope. The discovery of these correlates of virus neutralization will be useful for rational design of AIDS vaccines and better understanding of disease progression and prevention.

"Synthetic Molecular Sensors to Target Latently Infected Cells for HIV Eradication  PROJECT SUMMARY  There are no methods currently available for the eradication of the latent reservoir in HIV-infected patients. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop a new method based on synthetic molecular sensors that is capable of targeting latently infected cells in HIV-infected patients for destruction. The objective of this particular application is to design constructs known as ""Synthetic Molecular Sensors for HIV Eradication (SMaSHEd)"" and determine their ability to eradicate latently infected cells from HIV-infected patients or from in vitro latency models. The central hypothesis is that the promoter regions from host genes and the binding sites for miRNAs whose expression can discriminate latently infected from uninfected cells can be used as sensors in SMaSHEd constructs to specifically express a suicide gene in latently infected cells. The rationale for the proposed research is that new methods for eradicating the latent reservoir are required that specifically target latently infected cells, and do not directly target the variable HIV provirus, require activation of HIV replication, or rely on the host immune system to eradicate activated cells. Guided by strong preliminary data, our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1 & 2) Identify genes and miRNAs whose expression can discriminate latently infected primary CD4 T cells from uninfected cells, and (3) Determine the ability of SMaSHEd constructs to induce cell death in latently infected primary CD4 T cells. The analyses in Aim 1 & 2 will utilize RNA-Seq and smallRNA-Seq to identify the genes and miRNAs, respectively, that are differentially expressed between latently infected and uninfected primary memory CD4 T cells derived from the in vitro model of our collaborator Dr. Vincente Planelles. Our final aim will utilize procedures well established in the realm of synthetic biology to design SMaSHEd constructs containing the promoters and miRNA binding sites of genes (Aim 1) and miRNAs (Aim 2), respectively, that specifically sense the environment in latently infected cells. The ability of these constructs to induce the expression of a suicide gene specifically in latently infected primary CD4 T cells will be assessed following transfection or transduction of mixtures of latently infected and uninfected cells from the in vitro primary CD4 T cell latency model of Dr. Planelles and of Dr. O'Doherty, as well as from HIV-infected patients. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in our opinion, because it will utilize the latest advances in synthetic biology and information gained from next generation sequencing platforms (i.e., RNA-Seq and smallRNA-Seq) to develop a novel method for eradicating latently infected cells. This will be significant because it is the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to lead to the development of a new strategy for the eradication of the latent reservoir in HIV-infected patients. Ultimately, SMaSHEd constructs will be developed for use with appropriate vectors (i.e., adeno-associated virus) for the treatment of HIV-infected patients, where, in contrast to gene therapy, they will only require transient expression to induce the destruction of latently infected cells.  PROJECT NARRATIVE  This research is relevant to public health since it will develop the knowledge necessary for the design and testing of new therapeutic approaches for the eradication of latently infected cells from HIV-infected patients. Such an approach may eventually lead to a cure for HIV.

Proviral latency is the primay barrier to eradication of HIV-1 from infected individuals, owing to viral reactivation from reservoirs of latently infected cells upon interruption of antiretroviral treatment. It is known tht HIV-1 transcription significantly influences the regulation of HIV-1 latency. The proposed research will utilize high-throughput single-cell measurements to quantify modulated HIV-1 gene expression. A combination of drug perturbations and mutations of cis regulatory elements within the promoter will be used to modulate gene expression and stability of the latent state. Modulations using both approaches will be characterized by high-throughput flow cytometry to measure HIV-1 gene-expression from an array of HIV-1 constructs expressing GFP. Diverse modulations of gene expression will be tested for their ability to reactivate latent HIV as a function of their transcriptional modulation, with the aim of using the data to develop a detailed mechanistic model of transcriptionally driven latency and reactivation. With a deeper mechanistic understanding of latency and the potential discovery of novel reactivating compounds, this research has applications to the fields of HIV, systems biology, and pharmaceutical sciences.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The discovery of a cure for HIV is currently out of reach, hindered by the virus's ability to lay silent in a dormant state within the DNA of a human cell. This inactive or latent state reactivates at a later time, causing elevated levels of HIV, AIDS, an ultimately the death of an infected individual. By building on evidence that latency is heavily influenced by HIV-1 gene expression, this project aims to mechanistically understand how altering viral gene expression affects HIV latent stability using diverse biochemical approaches that modulate its expression and latent reactivation resulting in research of interests to the HIV and systems biology communities.            ",The Role of Transcriptional Noise in the Establishment of HIV-1 Latency,8467574,F32AI104380,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Preclinical ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Pre-Clinical ', ' Drug Screening ', ' Preclinical Drug Evaluation ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Viral Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Maintenance ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' hexamethylen bisacetamide ', ' diacetyldiaminohexane ', "" N,N'-hexamethylenebis-acetamide "", "" N,N'-diacetyl-1,6-hexanediamine "", "" N,N'-Hexamethylenebisacetamide "", "" N'-Diacetylhexamethylenediamine N "", ' Hexamethylenediacetamide ', ' Hexamethylenebisacetamide ', ' HMBA ', "" Acetamide, N,N'-1, 6-hexanediylbis- "", ' Hexamethylene Bisacetamide ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' suberanilohydroxamic acid ', ' Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid ', ' SAHA ', ' Vorinostat ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' purging ', ' purge ', ' Modeling ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' drug mechanism ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Mutate ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' reactivation from latency ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' high standard ', ' ']",NIAID,J.

"Synthetic Molecular Sensors to Target Latently Infected Cells for HIV Eradication     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are no methods currently available for the eradication of the latent reservoir in HIV-infected patients. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop a new method based on synthetic molecular sensors that is capable of targeting latently infected cells in HIV-infected patients for destruction. The objective of this particular application is to design constructs known as ""Synthetic Molecular Sensors for HIV Eradication (SMaSHEd)"" and determine their ability to eradicate latently infected cells from HIV-infected patients or from in vitro latency models. The central hypothesis is that the promoter regions from host genes and the binding sites for miRNAs whose expression can discriminate latently infected from uninfected cells can be used as sensors in SMaSHEd constructs to specifically express a suicide gene in latently infected cells. The rationale for the proposed research is that new methods for eradicating the latent reservoir are required that specifically target latently infected cells, and do not directly target the variable HIV provirus, require activation of HIV replication, or rely on the host immune system to eradicate activated cells. Guided by strong preliminary data, our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1 & 2) Identify genes and miRNAs whose expression can discriminate latently infected primary CD4 T cells from uninfected cells, and (3) Determine the ability of SMaSHEd constructs to induce cell death in latently infected primary CD4 T cells. The analyses in Aim 1 & 2 will utilize RNA-Seq and smallRNA-Seq to identify the genes and miRNAs, respectively that are differentially expressed between latently infected and uninfected primary memory CD4 T cells derived from the in vitro model of our collaborator Dr. Vincente Planelles. Our final aim wil utilize procedures well established in the realm of synthetic biology to design SMaSHEd constructs containing the promoters and miRNA binding sites of genes (Aim 1) and miRNAs (Aim 2), respectively, that specifically sense the environment in latently infected cells. The abilty of these constructs to induce the expression of a suicide gene specifically in latently infected primary CD4 T cells will be assessed following transfection or transduction of mixtures of latently infected and uninfected cells from the in vitro primary CD4 T cell latency model of Dr. Planelles and of Dr. O'Doherty, as well as from HIV-infected patients. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in our opinion, because it will utilize the latest advances in synthetic biology and information gained from next generation sequencing platforms (i.e., RNA-Seq and smallRNA-Seq) to develop a novel method for eradicating latently infected cells. This will be significant because it is the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to lea to the development of a new strategy for the eradication of the latent reservoir in HIV-infected patients. Ultimately, SMaSHEd constructs will be developed for use with appropriate vectors (i.e., adeno-associated virus) for the treatment of HIV-infected patients, where, in contrast to gene therapy, they will only require transient expression to induce the destruction of latently infected cells.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research is relevant to public health since it will develop the knowledge necessary for the design and testing of new therapeutic approaches for the eradication of latently infected cells from HIV-infected patients. Such an approach may eventually lead to a cure for HIV.

"An Interactive Video Game for HIV Prevention in At-Risk Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Video games are ubiquitous, can improve health behavior, but have not been evaluated as a tool to promote protection from HIV transmission in minority early adolescents. A major challenge in HIV prevention for minority adolescents is capturing individuals in     their environment - meeting individuals ""where they live"". The current application combines proven HIV prevention strategies and an interactive video game platform that incorporates virtual environments and intelligent conversant virtual characters to address this challenge. Research demonstrates that adolescents who acquire new knowledge, skills and attitudes in a video game, and practice these skills in the game, are more likely to behave similarly in real life. Therefore, the goal of this application is to adapt existing software to develop and refine an interactive video game designed to decrease HIV risk by teaching minority adolescents sex, drug and alcohol negotiation and refusal skills. The game will be adapted with input from minority adolescents, and collaborators with expertise in positive youth development, social cognitive theory and self-efficacy, prospect theory and message framing, software and artificial intelligence development, and commercial game design. We will evaluate the efficacy of the game by conducting a randomized clinical trial in 330 minority youths, ages 9-14 years, attending an after-school and/or weekend youth program, who will be randomly assigned to play the interactive HIV prevention video game, ""Retro-Warriors"", or to play a commercial ""off-the-shelf"" video game. Subjects will play two sessions/week of their assigned game for four weeks. The primary outcome will be initiation of sexual activity, defined as the initiation of either vaginal or anal intercourse. Secondary outcomes include HIV risk behavior knowledge, social competency, self-efficacy, drug/alcohol use behaviors and overall risk-taking behaviors. We hypothesize that the experimental group will have lower rates of initiation of sexual activity and have higher knowledge scores at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months compared with the control group. We will also explore if selected baseline characteristics are associated with an improved response to the negotiation skills training intervention embedded in the interactive video game. Unique features of this intervention will include the use of virtual characters or avatars who can verbally respond to and interact with the player, a realistic virtual urban setting, the use of sex, drug/alcohol ""risk challenges"" that the subjects can practice repeatedly, the use of message framing according to prospect theory, a fun and engaging intervention that encourages repeated involvement, and the ability to track the players' choices and behaviors in the game. The successful implementation of this application will represent a paradigm shift, providing evidence for the role of interactive games as HIV/AIDS prevention in minority adolescents. Video game technology has the potential to expand the available vehicles for HIV prevention to the increasing number of electronic gaming platforms including the internet, personal digital assistants, and cell phones, thereby creating a new avenue for public health interventions.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research is designed to develop and test a video game that will teach minority adolescents how to avoid sex, drug and alcohol risk behaviors that can lead to HIV infection. The research goes beyond the use of a game for education and proposes to create an interactive world in which the game players can engage in ""role-playing"" to learn to avoid risky behaviors. This application has far-reaching implications including the potential for this technology to ""travel"" with the player, i.e., the player ultimately can do sessions from home, on a console, a cell phone, or a personal digital assistant. There are international implications given that access to the internet is growing in developing countries and these technologies could be transferred to adolescents in countries experiencing a growing HIV epidemic but who have limited access to targeted risk reduction strategies. If successful, the results of this research will be video game technology that can improve individual and public health and decrease HIV transmission.

"Identifying Subgroups with Different Responses to HIV Risk Reduction Counseling     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aware, a large (n=5012) randomized comparative effectiveness trial, found that HIV risk reduction counseling for HIV negative individuals at the time of an HIV test did not have an impact on cumulative incidence of However, the question remains as to whether there are subgroups that would benefit from counseling. Further, understanding how counseling paradoxically increased STIs in MSM, the group most at risk for HIV in the US, and whether there are other subgroups who increased STIs is of public health importance. In recent innovations machine learning techniques have been used specifically to uncover subgroups with differential treatment responses in a fashion that is replicable and does not suffer model over-fitting associated with multiple testing. We will extend methods to explore treatment subgroups and differences across minority groups based on two of these approaches-Random Forests (RF), and Virtual Twins (VT). The VT approach uses random forests as a first step to create separate forest-based predictions of outcomes under both treatment and control conditions for each trial participant. Then a person-specific treatment effect is created for each individual and a tree-based prediction is made. Whereas this procedure has been shown to be very promising, there is a tendency for the procedure to have relatively low sensitivity, and low positive predictive value. These problems may be alleviated by replacing the single tree predictor of the individual-specific treatment effect by the random forest procedure and/or reweighting of the classification problem to equalize the number of treatment successes (STI incidence is far from affecting 50% of the sample). We will use simulations to uncover the optimal strategy and then use the optimal strategy to create a model that predicts likelihood of future STIs based on behaviors and likelihood of the individual having a positive or negative impact of counseling. We will also use an extension of this model to find the factors associated with the observed MSM by counseling interaction observed in Project Aware. The significance of this research lies in 1) determining if there are subgroups of STD clinic patients who would benefit from or be harmed by short HIV risk reduction counseling 2) providing a model to target these individuals or understanding why they may show increased STIs, and 3) providing the groundwork for use of these approaches to understanding the heterogeneous response to other HIV prevention interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A recent large (n=5012) national study, Project Aware1, showed that on average there was no impact of brief risk reduction counseling on the likelihood of getting a new sexually transmitted infection (STI). This project will determine if there are subgroups of individuals who actually did benefit from brief risk reduction counseling and decreased their likelihood of a future STI as a result or subgroups that showed increases in STIs when counseled. If there are any subgroups with benefit of counseling evident in the data, this project will create a predictive model which could be used to identify individuals prospectively who would benefit from brief sexual risk reduction counseling when visiting an STD clinic; if there are subgroups with negative impact the project will help to understand why.                ",Identifying Subgroups with Different Responses to HIV Risk Reduction Counseling,8798287,R21DA038641,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complication ', ' Counseling ', ' Future ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Twins ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' forest ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' group counseling ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' success ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' Behavioral ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' virtual ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment effect ', ' person centered ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment response ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2014,230250,0.2968017284652526

The rationale for the proposed research is that new methods for eradicating the latent reservoir are required that specifically target latently infected cells, and do not directly target the variable HIV provirus, require activation of HIV replication, or rely on the host immune system to eradicate activated cells. Guided by strong preliminary data, our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1 & 2) Identify genes and miRNAs whose expression can discriminate latently infected primary CD4 T cells from uninfected cells, and (3) Determine the ability of SMaSHEd constructs to induce cell death in latently infected primary CD4 T cells. The analyses in Aim 1 & 2 will utilize RNA-Seq and smallRNA-Seq to identify the genes and miRNAs, respectively that are differentially expressed between latently infected and uninfected primary memory CD4 T cells derived from the in vitro model of our collaborator Dr. Vincente Planelles. Our final aim wil utilize procedures well established in the realm of synthetic biology to design SMaSHEd constructs containing the promoters and miRNA binding sites of genes (Aim 1) and miRNAs (Aim 2), respectively, that specifically sense the environment in latently infected cells. The abilty of these constructs to induce the expression of a suicide gene specifically in latently infected primary CD4 T cells will be assessed following transfection or transduction of mixtures of latently infected and uninfected cells from the in vitro primary CD4 T cell latency model of Dr. Planelles and of Dr. O'Doherty, as well as from HIV-infected patients. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in our opinion, because it will utilize the latest advances in synthetic biology and information gained from next generation sequencing platforms (i.e., RNA-Seq and smallRNA-Seq) to develop a novel method for eradicating latently infected cells. This will be significant because it is the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to lea to the development of a new strategy for the eradication of the latent reservoir in HIV-infected patients. Ultimately, SMaSHEd constructs will be developed for use with appropriate vectors (i.e., adeno-associated virus) for the treatment of HIV-infected patients, where, in contrast to gene therapy, they will only require transient expression to induce the destruction of latently infected cells.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research is relevant to public health since it will develop the knowledge necessary for the design and testing of new therapeutic approaches for the eradication of latently infected cells from HIV-infected patients. Such an approach may eventually lead to a cure for HIV. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIAID's mission that pertains to the better understanding and treatment of infectious diseases.            ",Synthetic Molecular Sensors to Target Latently Infected Cells for HIV Eradication,8607892,R21AI104282,"['adeno associated virus group ', ' Adeno-Associated Viruses ', ' Dependovirus ', ' inhibitor ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cell Death ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cells ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' endonuclease ', ' Environment ', ' genetic therapy ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' Gene-Tx ', ' Gene Transfer Procedure ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' Gene Therapy Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' gene therapy ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' HeLa ', ' Hela Cells ', ' Histones ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' In Vitro ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' genetic promoter element ', ' Promotor Regions (Genetics) ', ' Promotor Regions ', ' Promoter Regions ', ' Promoter Regions (Genetics) ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Proviruses ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transfection ', ' Virus Induction ', ' Virus Activation ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Apoptosis ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Procedures ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Letters ', ' cysteine protease P32 ', ' Yama protein ', ' Yama ', ' SREBP Cleavage Activity 1 ', ' SCA-1 ', ' PARP Cleavage Protease ', ' Cysteine Protease CPP32 ', ' CPP32beta ', ' CPP32B ', ' CPP32 protein ', ' CPP32 ', ' CPP-32 ', ' CASP3 ', ' CASP-3 ', ' Apoptosis-Related Cysteine Protease Caspase 3 ', ' Apopain ', ' caspase-3 ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immune response ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Viral ', "" 3'UTR "", "" 3' Untranslated Regions "", ' novel ', ' design and construct ', ' design and construction ', ' Modeling ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Data ', ' in vitro Model ', ' General Infectious Diseases / Treatment ', ' infectious disease treatment ', ' Molecular ', ' Derivation ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' vector ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' suicide gene ', ' memory CD4 T cell ', ' memory CD4 T lymphocyte ', ' Homing ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' adeno-associated virus vector ', ' AAV vector ', ' adeno-associated viral vector ', ' synthetic biology ', ' public health relevance ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' RNA-seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON,R21,2014,148500,0.16953573031392224
"Predicting Brain Changes in HIV/AIDS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In affluent countries where combination anti-retroviral therapy (CART) is widely used, life expectancy with HIV has increased well beyond 10 years, but this has greatly increased the number of people living with HIV/AIDS. 40 million people are now at risk for progressive HIV-related damage to the brain (Navia 2011), and 40% show some neurological or cognitive impairment. Building on our recent discoveries and innovations in MRI and diffusion tensor imaging, our project charts the dynamics of HIV disease in the brain, revealing factors that predict clinical decline and brain decline. By analyzing data from the HIVNC (HIV Neuroimaging Consortium) cohort (218 HIV+ subjects scanned longitudinally with MRI every 26-32 weeks for 3 years; 900 scans), we will use our sensitive image analysis method, tensor-based morphometry to (1) map rates of brain tissue loss over time, determining which brain systems lose tissue fastest; (2) relate these loss patterns to neurocognitive impairment (NCI); and (3) determine which host and disease-related factors, at baseline, predict higher atrophic rates over the 3-year follow-up interval. To deeply probe the causes of dysfunction, we will use whole-brain tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging in 267 subjects to determine where HIV+ patients have reduced fiber integrity. We will use each patient's DTI scan to compute a whole-brain connection matrix, based on a state-of-the-art whole-brain tractography method we developed. We will combine the best neuroimaging measures from Aims 1 and 2 into our support vector machine method to predict (1) future rates of atrophy, and (2) cognitive decline over the 3-year follow-up. With our best predictors of decline from Aims 1 and 2, we will predict which HIV+ patients will show imminent decline. We will estimate the sample sizes needed for a neuroimaging-based drug trial to detect a 5%, 10%, or 25% slowing in the rate of atrophy, and the same percents of slowing in the rate of cognitive decline. We will test whether our predictors generalize to the large, independent Charter and Miriam datasets beyond HIVNC (see Support Letters from Drs. Igor Grant and Ron Cohen), and when used by our many HIV research collaborators now using our methods; see Pilot Data). As shown in new pilot data, we assess how imaging protocol differences affect the measures; our innovations to reduce scan protocol confounds (e.g., adjusted FA) will guide selection of the most robust predictors. We will evaluate how useful these new measures are for predicting cognitive decline, and boosting power in an antiretroviral drug trial. In other words, to what extent can a DTI scan, and an MRI-based map of atrophy, help to make clinical predictions of imminent cognitive impairment? Can they help select a sample for a drug trial? Our activities will make clinical trial design more efficient by selecting subjects with greater potential to respond t future therapies. As always, we will disseminate our methods to both experts and trainees in medicine, neuroscience, engineering, and to our network of over 100 collaborating labs (including two national HIV consortia: HIVNC, CHARTER, and the Miriam HIV cohort), to accelerate their work. Building on our recent discoveries, this project greatly advances our ability to map, and predict, brain changes in people living with HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS is perhaps the greatest threat to public health worldwide in the 21st century. 40 million people are HIV-infected - a shocking 1 out of every 100 people aged 18-45 - and 40% have some neurological or cognitive impairment. Our work offers 3 immediate public health consequences: (1) new methods to predict whether a person with HIV/AIDS will show imminent brain decline; (2) enhancing basic neuroscience, identifying brain circuits disrupted by the virus, and (3) a clear method to boost power for clinical trials of drugs to treat the brain in the millios of people now living with HIV/AIDS.",Predicting Brain Changes in

"Long Term Effects of Chronic HIV Infection on the Developing Brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R01 application builds upon a successful R21 grant that examined a cohort of Romanian adolescents and young adults who are long-term HIV survivors and who, despite over a decade of effective treatment, still demonstrate neuropsychological impairments (approx. 50% of subjects). The key feature of the next stage of this study is that these late teens and early 20s HIV+ cases, who were parenterally infected a long time ago, and for whom we have extensive longitudinal biological and treatment information, may experience altered maturation of the brain, with possible neurocognitive and social cognition sequelae. Prior to 1989, only 13 AIDS cases from Romania had been reported to the WHO, while by the end of 1990, 1168 cases were reported, of which 1094 were in children less than 13 years of age. Genetic characterization of the HIV circulating in these institutions revealed that all the children were infected with HIV clade F1  SA#1: Study the neuromedical (NM) characteristics of a long-term surviving cohort of HIV+ patients on HAART and compare them to the HAND features. We will examine the relationship between past and present NM data, including CD4 counts, VL, HAART and HAND-associated elements like: NP impairment, daily functioning, risk behavior, treatment adherence and psychiatric comorbidities.  SA#2: Study the viral genetic factors associated with HAND in long-term survivors infected with clade F since early childhood. We will sequence and test in vitro the neurotropic potential of patient viral isolates and identify conserved viral genetic elements ('brain signature sequences') in the env (C2-V3) coding region, from HIV DNA extracted from the CSF and PBMC of subjects with or without HAND. Our study in the well-characterized Romanian cohort offers a unique opportunity to make prognostic correlations between host immune, viral, treatment, comorbid factors, and HAND in young adults who are living with HIV since childhood, most often being infected during the earliest stages of brain development. As these individuals mature, it will be important to understand the implications of neurocognitive impairment on their future behaviors.        Millions of patients are at risk of developing HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). We have identified a unique patient cohort that could help in deciphering the risk factors associated with HAND. The overarching hypothesis is that HAND will continue to be prevalent in the long term surviving young adults on HAART and it will have a significant impact on their lives.

"The Role of Transcriptional Noise in the Establishment of HIV-1 Latency     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) has the ability to enter a long-lived dormant state, termed proviral latency. Proviral latency is the primay barrier to eradication of HIV-1 from infected individuals, owing to viral reactivation from reservoirs of latently infected cells upon interruption of antiretroviral treatment. It is known tht HIV-1 transcription significantly influences the regulation of HIV-1 latency. The proposed research will utilize high-throughput single-cell measurements to quantify modulated HIV-1 gene expression. A combination of drug perturbations and mutations of cis regulatory elements within the promoter will be used to modulate gene expression and stability of the latent state. Modulations using both approaches will be characterized by high-throughput flow cytometry to measure HIV-1 gene-expression from an array of HIV-1 constructs expressing GFP. Diverse modulations of gene expression will be tested for their ability to reactivate latent HIV as a function of their transcriptional modulation, with the aim of using the data to develop a detailed mechanistic model of transcriptionally driven latency and reactivation. With a deeper mechanistic understanding of latency and the potential discovery of novel reactivating compounds, this research has applications to the fields of HIV, systems biology, and pharmaceutical sciences.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The discovery of a cure for HIV is currently out of reach, hindered by the virus's ability to lay silent in a dormant state within the DNA of a human cell. This inactive or latent state reactivates at a later time, causing elevated levels of HIV, AIDS, an ultimately the death of an infected individual. By building on evidence that latency is heavily influenced by HIV-1 gene expression, this project aims to mechanistically understand how altering viral gene expression affects HIV latent stability using diverse biochemical approaches that modulate its expression and latent reactivation resulting in research of interests to the HIV and systems biology communities.            ",The Role of Transcriptional Noise in the Establishment of HIV-1 Latency,8588785,F32AI104380,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Preclinical ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Pre-Clinical ', ' Drug Screening ', ' Preclinical Drug Evaluation ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Viral Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Maintenance ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' hexamethylen bisacetamide ', ' diacetyldiaminohexane ', "" N,N'-hexamethylenebis-acetamide "", "" N,N'-diacetyl-1,6-hexanediamine "", "" N,N'-Hexamethylenebisacetamide "", "" N'-Diacetylhexamethylenediamine N "", ' Hexamethylenediacetamide ', ' Hexamethylenebisacetamide ', ' HMBA ', "" Acetamide, N,N'-1, 6-hexanediylbis- "", ' Hexamethylene Bisacetamide ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' suberanilohydroxamic acid ', ' Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid ', ' SAHA ', ' Vorinostat ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' purging ', ' purge ', ' Modeling ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' drug mechanism ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Mutate ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' reactivation from latency ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' high standard ', ' ']",NIAID,J.

"The Interdependency of Drug Resistance Evolution and Drug Design: HIV-1 Protease     DESCRIPTION: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies. The pressures of evolution will likely result in a variety of pathways for resistance to evolve. Drug resistance can be caused by a change in the balance of molecular recognition events that selectively weakens inhibitor binding but maintains the biological function of the therapeutic target. To reduce the likelihood of drug resistance, the interdependency of the target's function within the context of the biological system in which it exists must be elucidated. Disrupting the therapeutic target's activity is necessary but not sufficient for avoiding resistance. In this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that key pathways and coupled mechanisms confer drug resistance to therapeutic targets. We seek to define the sequence, structural and dynamic, and temporal evolutionary constraints of the interdependency of drug resistance: 1) to recognize the pathways by which resistance occurs and 2) to devise drug design strategies for developing a drug that is robust against resistance. HIV-1 Protease is the perfect case study! HIV evolves very quickly with on average a point mutation introduced in every third genome replicated. HIV protease inhibitors have the potential of being both very potent and robust to resistance. Protease inhibitors are the only HIV inhibitor class that are transition state analogs and can be evolutionarily constrained within the substrate envelope. Inhibitors that leverage both of these characteristics, such as Darunavir (DRV) and similar analogs, have the potential of being robust, nearly resistance proof inhibitors, to drug- na¿ve HIV infected patients. If HIV achieves resistance to these inhibitors it is only through complex pathways and combinations of mutations. Further elucidating these complex pathways will bring us closer to resistance-proof inhibitors. In this project our team will use and develop cutting-edge technology to follow the pathways of drug resistance selection, to elucidate the molecular basis for their interdependent patterns and incorporate these mechanisms into drug design strategies. Together we will make inroads into tackling drug resistance that would be impossible for any of us to individually achieve         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies.

The goal of this K24 proposal is to provide the applicant with sufficiet support to mentor trainees in state-of-the-art translational and patient oriented HIV research and to expand his involvement in UCSD's wide array of training programs. This application is built upon funded, active and ongoing research projects, where the mentee is the primary leader and is trained in every aspect of study design, execution, analyses, results interpretation and publication. The presented studies provide opportunities for in-depth mentoring as well as investigation into important and open scientific questions in HIV pathogenesis. These goals will be met in the following three aims, which incorporate multiple clinical studies and six current mentees. SPECIFIC AIM 1: To determine virologic and immunologic dynamics during primary HIV infection by investigating: the genital tract (1A), gut associated lymphoid tissue (1B), and the neutralizing antibody response in the blood (1C). SPECIFIC AIM 2: To validate pooling methods for diagnostic purposes in resource limited settings to detect: virologic failure of antiretroviral therapy (2A) and sub-acute malaria infection in the setting of HIV infection (2B). SPECIFIC AIM 3: To use molecular epidemiologic methods to characterize HIV-1 transmission networks between San Diego and Tijuana. Taken together, this proposal will allow the mid-career applicant to continue and expand his HIV research and mentoring activities.           The success of future HIV research will depend on the training of new researchers today. The goal of this K24 proposal is to allow the applicant to continue and expand his mentoring activities by reducing the amount of his time spent on administrative and clinical responsibilities. If this proposal is successful, he will be able to deote at least 90% of his time to HIV research and mentoring of junior faculty, Infectious Disease fellows, and graduate and post-doctoral students in translational HIV research.

"High-throughput Deep Sequencing Assay to Reliably Measure the HIV Reservoir during Antiretroviral Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study is designed to meet the goals of the RFA ""Innovative assays to quantify the latent HIV reservoir"" that can ""facilitate proof-of-concept studies for curing HIV infection."" To meet this challenge we propose to develop and validate a combined next generation sequencing (Pacific Biosciences single-molecule, real time (SMRT) sequencing) and bioinformatics platform to accurately measure replication-competent provirus (i.e. Proviral Phenotypic Predictor; P3). An over-arching objective would be for the assay to have a ""higher throughput, faster turnaround, lower cost, and greater reproducibility"" than the current standard quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA). We will develop and validate the proposed P3 platform based on international standard procedures for diagnostic molecular methods (i.e. CAP and OIE) using latently infected cells from HIV-infected individuals on optimized antiretroviral therapy for at least 2 years. These participants will be well-characterize to estimated duration of infection at the start of their therapy, and will represent high, medium and low levels of HIV DNA levels. Such characterizations will be necessary to adequately address the dynamic range of the proposed P3 platform. Once P3 methods have been optimized, we will rigorously compare P3 and QVOA methods in their ability to characterize the replication competent proviral reservoir and by costs and turnaround time for results.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal is specifically designed to develop and validate a high-throughput next generation sequencing and bioinformatics platform (P3=""Proviral Phenotypic Predictor"") to fully characterize the latent HIV reservoir through quantification and sequencing of Full-length HIV provirus. We will determine the accuracy and exact error rate for our proposed platform, and we will compare this new assay to the standard quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA) to delineate what amount of intact and replication competent HIV genomes is not inducible (and therefore not recognized) by QVOA. Being able to characterize each part of the HIV DNA population, and especially determine what proportion of intact and replication competent HIV DNA is not inducible by standard QVOA, will allow us to better evaluate the impact of any intervention aimed at reducing the HIV latent reservoir. 1            ",High-throughput Deep Sequencing Assay to Reliably Measure the HIV Reservoir during Antiretroviral Therapy,8965553,R01AI120009,"['nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cells ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Methods ', ' Phaseolus vulgaris Lectins ', ' Kidney Bean Lectins ', ' Phytohemagglutinins ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Proviruses ', ' Rest ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Peripheral ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Stop Codon ', ' Codon, Termination, Premature ', ' Nonsense Codon ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Viral ', ' meetings ', ' PBMC ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' Participant ', ' Appearance ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' single molecule ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Technics ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Methods ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Techniques ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' International ', ' Interruption ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' Allogenic ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' deep sequencing ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' open source ', ' public health relevance ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' HIV Genome ', ' ']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,390155,0.29035726448441807
"Semi-Automated Processing of Interconnected Dyads Using Entity Resolution (SPIDER) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching aim of this proposal is to develop and verify a new and innovative software system that will assist researchers in more rigorously constructing social networks. During the past two decades, studies have increasingly employed social network analysis (SNA) to understand HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI) transmission. The mapping of ""risk networks,"" in which individuals are connected by infection-spreading ties, has yielded especially valuable insight into the behavioral epidemiology of HIV and STI, and has informed promising interventions designed for people at risk for or living with HIV. However, despite these advances and the burgeoning popularity of SNA-based HIV/STI research, major methodological and technological challenges are hindering further progress in the field. SNA's ability to catalyze major epidemiologic advances relies on researchers' ability to construct valid representations of participants' networks from behavioral data. The standard protocol for constructing risk networks, or identifying direct and indirect relationships among participants and their partners, involves matching participants' names and demographics with data provided about named partners. This process of identifying and matching duplicate individuals in the network (i.e., ""entity resolution"" [ER]) is often conducted through laborious, manual cross-referencing procedures. These procedures are limited in their reproducibility and may lead to misspecification of network structure. Further complicating valid network construction is that ER criteria are: (1) not formalized; (2) specified differently across studies n various settings and populations; and (3) rarely, if ever, explained in the published literature. Semi-automated tools that combine powerful automated ER processes with capacities for customization and qualitative input have the potential to dramatically improve the speed and accuracy of risk network construction. Current tools for ER in health research tend to focus on a static subset of available ER techniques (e.g., similarity in demographics, phonetic-based matching techniques) without incorporating state- of-the-art approaches (e.g., machine learning). The proposed software, Semi-automated Processing of Interconnected Dyads using Entity Resolution (SPIDER), will provide users with a system that enables efficient, semi-automated network construction using a library of robust, statistically rigorous ER algorithms, rich desktop-based annotation tools, and secure web-based technologies. The customizability of SPIDER will allow for multi-disciplinary utility in studies using varying designs and will include innovative features that specifically respond to emerging methodological trends in HIV/STI research. The overarching goal of this project is to improve the efficiency and quality of network construction used in research, thereby improving the evidence base for network-based interventions that mitigate the spread of HIV.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching aim of this Phase I proposal is to develop and verify a software system that will assist researchers, interventionists, and practitioners in more rigorously constructing social networks.

"Identifying Subgroups with Different Responses to HIV Risk Reduction Counseling DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aware, a large (n=5012) randomized comparative effectiveness trial, found that HIV risk reduction counseling for HIV negative individuals at the time of an HIV test did not have an impact on cumulative incidence of However, the question remains as to whether there are subgroups that would benefit from counseling. Further, understanding how counseling paradoxically increased STIs in MSM, the group most at risk for HIV in the US, and whether there are other subgroups who increased STIs is of public health importance. In recent innovations machine learning techniques have been used specifically to uncover subgroups with differential treatment responses in a fashion that is replicable and does not suffer model over-fitting associated with multiple testing. We will extend methods to explore treatment subgroups and differences across minority groups based on two of these approaches-Random Forests (RF), and Virtual Twins (VT). The VT approach uses random forests as a first step to create separate forest-based predictions of outcomes under both treatment and control conditions for each trial participant. Then a person-specific treatment effect is created for each individual and a tree-based prediction is made. Whereas this procedure has been shown to be very promising, there is a tendency for the procedure to have relatively low sensitivity, and low positive predictive value. These problems may be alleviated by replacing the single tree predictor of the individual-specific treatment effect by the random forest procedure and/or reweighting of the classification problem to equalize the number of treatment successes (STI incidence is far from affecting 50% of the sample). We will use simulations to uncover the optimal strategy and then use the optimal strategy to create a model that predicts likelihood of future STIs based on behaviors and likelihood of the individual having a positive or negative impact of counseling. We will also use an extension of this model to find the factors associated with the observed MSM by counseling interaction observed in Project Aware. The significance of this research lies in 1) determining if there are subgroups of STD clinic patients who would benefit from or be harmed by short HIV risk reduction counseling 2) providing a model to target these individuals or understanding why they may show increased STIs, and 3) providing the groundwork for use of these approaches to understanding the heterogeneous response to other HIV prevention interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A recent large (n=5012) national study, Project Aware1, showed that on average there was no impact of brief risk reduction counseling on the likelihood of getting a new sexually transmitted infection (STI). This project will determine if there are subgroups of individuals who actually did benefit from brief risk reduction counseling and decreased their likelihood of a future STI as a result or subgroups that showed increases in STIs when counseled. If there are any subgroups with benefit of counseling evident in the data, this project will create a predictive model which could be used to identify individuals prospectively who would benefit from brief sexual risk reduction counseling when visiting an STD clinic; if there are subgroups with negative impact the project will help to understand why.",Identifying Subgroups with Different Responses to HIV Risk Reduction Counseling,8866385,R21DA038641,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complication ', ' Counseling ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Twins ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' forest ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' group counseling ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' Visit ', ' success ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Data ', ' Predictive Value ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' Behavioral ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' virtual ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment effect ', ' person centered ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' high risk ', ' treatment response ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2015,188996,0.2968017284652526
"The oral microbiome and enterosalivary circulation of nitric oxide in HIV. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic HIV is associated with increased risk of pulmonary and cardiovascular complications. Despite use of antiretroviral therapy, rates of even rare vascular complications such as pulmonary hypertension occur upwards of 25 times that in HIV- individuals. The cause for such a high rate of vascular complications in HIV is unknown. Nitric oxide (NO) is a critically important signaling molecule that is produced by the vascular endothelium and acts as a vasodilator and regulator of cardiovascular health. Reduction of nitrate to nitrite and nitric oxide by commensal oral bacteria has recently been implicated in the maintenance of vascular function. The enterosalivary NO pathway is an important component of nitric oxide generation as nitrate is converted to nitrite by a series of bacterial enzymes in the mouth, which is then swallowed and either directly converted to NO or absorbed into the bloodstream where it exerts systemic NO-like effects. The enterosalivary NO pathway depends on viable populations of oral bacteria and helps regulate blood pressure and mitigate vascular injury. However, little is known about the specific bacterial populations involved or the contribution to systemic NO availability and vascular injury and disease. Our preliminary studies suggest that HIV+ individuals have a different profile of oral commensal bacteria (oral microbiome) than HIV- individuals that involves key nitrate reduction pathways. This study proposes the novel hypothesis that the accelerated cardio- and pulmonary vascular disease seen in HIV is due in part to changes in the oral microbiome that favor a disruption of the enterosalivary NO pathway, reduced NO availability, and chronic vascular injury. To test this hypothesis, the oral microbiome of an established cohort of 315 HIV+ and HIV- participants will be characterized using culture-independent sequencing techniques in banked oral wash samples. Expression of specific bacterial nitrate-reducing enzymes will be measured, and results correlated with available serological markers of vascular damage, echocardiographic testing, and radiographic measures of vascular injury. Results will directly inform future clinical enrollment of a prospective trial examining real-time nitrate metabolism, systemic NO distribution, and associated physiological effects. These investigations will offer the first stepsin understanding a novel pathway of HIV-associated vascular disease and inform development of targeted therapies. Additionally, this NRSA award will provide the candidate, a pulmonary medicine fellow, the opportunity for further training in pulmonary vascular medicine and for developing skills in HIV/AIDS and microbiome research. The candidate will acquire extensive training in basic and advanced laboratory techniques, biostatistics, and clinical study design through labwork, conferences, and a master's degree in clinical/translational research. The resources and experience of mentors Dr. Morris, an expert in HIV-related lung disease and the microbiome, and Dr. Gladwin, an expert in NO and pulmonary vascular disease, combined with the expansive array of resources available at the University of Pittsburgh, will support the candidate's successful development.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary vascular and cardiovascular diseases remain a major source of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals in the current era of effective antiretroviral therapy. Reduction of nitrate to nitrite and nitric oxide by commensal oral bacteria has recently been implicated in the maintenance of vascular function. Normal populations of bacteria that live in the mouth are key in maintaining adequate levels of nitric oxide and thus important in vascular function, but these key bacteria may be altered in those with HIV and contribute to excess pulmonary vascular and cardiovascular risk. This proposal will determine changes in the oral microbiome in HIV, the impact of these changes on nitrate reduction pathways, and relationship to markers of vascular function.            ",The

"Predicting Brain Changes in HIV/AIDS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In affluent countries where combination anti-retroviral therapy (CART) is widely used, life expectancy with HIV has increased well beyond 10 years, but this has greatly increased the number of people living with HIV/AIDS. 40 million people are now at risk for progressive HIV-related damage to the brain (Navia 2011), and 40% show some neurological or cognitive impairment. Building on our recent discoveries and innovations in MRI and diffusion tensor imaging, our project charts the dynamics of HIV disease in the brain, revealing factors that predict clinical decline and brain decline. By analyzing data from the HIVNC (HIV Neuroimaging Consortium) cohort (218 HIV+ subjects scanned longitudinally with MRI every 26-32 weeks for 3 years; 900 scans), we will use our sensitive image analysis method, tensor-based morphometry to (1) map rates of brain tissue loss over time, determining which brain systems lose tissue fastest; (2) relate these loss patterns to neurocognitive impairment (NCI); and (3) determine which host and disease-related factors, at baseline, predict higher atrophic rates over the 3-year follow-up interval. To deeply probe the causes of dysfunction, we will use whole-brain tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging in 267 subjects to determine where HIV+ patients have reduced fiber integrity. We will use each patient's DTI scan to compute a whole-brain connection matrix, based on a state-of-the-art whole-brain tractography method we developed. We will combine the best neuroimaging measures from Aims 1 and 2 into our support vector machine method to predict (1) future rates of atrophy, and (2) cognitive decline over the 3-year follow-up. With our best predictors of decline from Aims 1 and 2, we will predict which HIV+ patients will show imminent decline. We will estimate the sample sizes needed for a neuroimaging-based drug trial to detect a 5%, 10%, or 25% slowing in the rate of atrophy, and the same percents of slowing in the rate of cognitive decline. We will test whether our predictors generalize to the large, independent Charter and Miriam datasets beyond HIVNC (see Support Letters from Drs. Igor Grant and Ron Cohen), and when used by our many HIV research collaborators now using our methods; see Pilot Data). As shown in new pilot data, we assess how imaging protocol differences affect the measures; our innovations to reduce scan protocol confounds (e.g., adjusted FA) will guide selection of the most robust predictors. We will evaluate how useful these new measures are for predicting cognitive decline, and boosting power in an antiretroviral drug trial. In other words, to what extent can a DTI scan, and an MRI-based map of atrophy, help to make clinical predictions of imminent cognitive impairment? Can they help select a sample for a drug trial? Our activities will make clinical trial design more efficient by selecting subjects with greater potential to respond t future therapies. As always, we will disseminate our methods to both experts and trainees in medicine, neuroscience, engineering, and to our network of over 100 collaborating labs (including two national HIV consortia: HIVNC, CHARTER, and the Miriam HIV cohort), to accelerate their work. Building on our recent discoveries, this project greatly advances our ability to map, and predict, brain changes in people living with HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS is perhaps the greatest threat to public health worldwide in the 21st century. 40 million people are HIV-infected - a shocking 1 out of every 100 people aged 18-45 - and 40% have some neurological or cognitive impairment. Our work offers 3 immediate public health consequences: (1) new methods to predict whether a person with HIV/AIDS will show imminent brain decline; (2) enhancing basic neuroscience, identifying brain circuits disrupted by the virus, and (3) a clear method to boost power for clinical trials of drugs to treat the brain in the millios of people now living with HIV/AIDS.",Predicting Brain Changes in

"Optimizing HIV Treatment Monitoring under Resource Constraints ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With escalating global access to HIV antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, treatment failure is inevitable and must be anticipated. Correct and early diagnosis of treatment failure is essential for cost savings, durable response to therapy and prevention of morbidity and mortality. Most HIV treatment programs in the developing world either do not have access to viral load (VL) testing, the gold-standard treatment monitoring modality, or can apply it only on a limited basis. Other monitoring technologies such as drug resistance testing are even less common for financial and infrastructure constraints. In this proposal we will develop, evaluate and implement methods to optimize monitoring of ARV therapy in resource limited settings (RLS) that have diverse VL availability. Though several recent studies have proposed and evaluated lower-cost markers as VL surrogates and strategies for selective VL use, they generally are not based on a formal, decision theoretic framework that allows discovery of strategies with optimality properties that can be expressed in terms of misclassification rate, cost, and other clinically relevant parameters. We propose to develop the statistical framework, theory and methods required to discover optimal diagnostic algorithms for monitoring treatment failure with limited or no VL availability; to use cohort data from both the US and Kenya to derive, calibrate and cross-validate the algorithms; to use extant plasma samples from patients in a PEPFAR-funded HIV care program to design and cross-validate a new diagnostic algorithm that includes implementation of pooled assays; and to develop usable software that will enable programs to design their own protocols based on the characteristics of their patient population and local capacity for viral load testing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Effective use of antiretroviral therapy is critical for managing and preventing the spread of HIV in the developing world. This proposal develops methods that make optimal use of diagnostic tests having limited availability to monitor the effectiveness of therapy and to prompt a change in regimen when it is warranted. Successful implementation will improve patient outcomes and help to prevent the spread of treatment-resistant strains of HIV.            ",Optimizing HIV Treatment Monitoring under Resource Constraints,8847003,R01AI108441,"['Algorithms ', ' Archives ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Calibration ', ' Canada ', ' Cations ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' Europe ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Kenya ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Side ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' simulation ', ' treatment program ', ' Modality ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' HIV therapy ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention therapy ', ' Population ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' resistance strain ', ' resistant strain ', ' Regimen ', ' ']",NIAID,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,766672,0.2509127164542943
"Long Term Effects of Chronic HIV Infection on the Developing Brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R01 application builds upon a successful R21 grant that examined a cohort of Romanian adolescents and young adults who are long-term HIV survivors and who, despite over a decade of effective treatment, still demonstrate neuropsychological impairments (approx. 50% of subjects). The key feature of the next stage of this study is that these late teens and early 20s HIV+ cases, who were parenterally infected a long time ago, and for whom we have extensive longitudinal biological and treatment information, may experience altered maturation of the brain, with possible neurocognitive and social cognition sequelae. Prior to 1989, only 13 AIDS cases from Romania had been reported to the WHO, while by the end of 1990, 1168 cases were reported, of which 1094 were in children less than 13 years of age. Genetic characterization of the HIV circulating in these institutions revealed that all the children were infected with HIV clade F1  SA#1: Study the neuromedical (NM) characteristics of a long-term surviving cohort of HIV+ patients on HAART and compare them to the HAND features. We will examine the relationship between past and present NM data, including CD4 counts, VL, HAART and HAND-associated elements like: NP impairment, daily functioning, risk behavior, treatment adherence and psychiatric comorbidities.  SA#2: Study the viral genetic factors associated with HAND in long-term survivors infected with clade F since early childhood. We will sequence and test in vitro the neurotropic potential of patient viral isolates and identify conserved viral genetic elements ('brain signature sequences') in the env (C2-V3) coding region, from HIV DNA extracted from the CSF and PBMC of subjects with or without HAND. Our study in the well-characterized Romanian cohort offers a unique opportunity to make prognostic correlations between host immune, viral, treatment, comorbid factors, and HAND in young adults who are living with HIV since childhood, most often being infected during the earliest stages of brain development. As these individuals mature, it will be important to understand the implications of neurocognitive impairment on their future behaviors. Millions of patients are at risk of developing HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). We have identified a unique patient cohort that could help in deciphering the risk factors associated with HAND. The overarching hypothesis is that HAND will continue to be prevalent in the long term surviving young adults on HAART and it will have a significant impact on their lives.",Long Term Effects of Chronic HIV Infection on the Developing Brain,8848889,R01MH094159,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Laboratories ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' neurological disease ', ' Neurological Disorders ', ' Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Diseases ', ' nervous system disorder ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Patients ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Romania ', ' Time ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' LTS ', ' Long-Term Survivors ', ' prognostic ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Genetic ', ' Staging ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Immune ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Viral Genetics ', ' virus genetics ', ' early childhood ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' genetic element ', ' PBMC ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' HIV-1 Long-Term Survivors ', ' HIV Long-Term Survivors ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' social cognition ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' daily functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' thirteen year old ', ' age 13 years ', ' 13 year old ', ' Impairment ', ' neurotropic ', ' neuropsychological ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' treatment adherence ', ' in vitro testing ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,362972,0.2559903692343469
"DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several efficacy trials of pre-exposure prophylaxis (daily antiretroviral therapy to prevent HIV acquisition in uninfected persons with sexual exposures) have failed because of poor adherence to medications. To ensure accurate, longitudinal measurement of pill ingestion with real-time monitoring, we plan to develop DOT Diary (D2), a smartphone application that uses artificial intelligence for measuring pill taking using Directly Observed Therapy. This patented technology will be combined with a daily sexual diary for use in future PrEP observational and efficacy trials. Such an approach provides aggregated data for individual participants, study sites, and trials overall, that facilitates realtime feedback to maximize adherence. We plan a 3 stage process for building and evaluating D2. First, we will assess the assess the reliability and validity of the automated DOT tool to identify attempts to ""cheat"" and over-report pill taking, as well as to evaluate the sensitivity of the measure to detecting 1- to 3-week interruptions in pill use. Second, we will develop and optimize the feasibility and acceptability of D2 for participants and study staff in tracking participation ver time, and providing real-time adherence feedback to study participants. Lastly, we will run a 24-week pilot study of D2 for high-risk men who have sex with men to evaluate the plausibility that this tool can be successfully used to measure and optimize adherence in future PrEP trials.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many studies of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP (giving an anti-HIV medication to an HIV uninfected person to prevent infection from their HIV positive sex partner) have failed to tell us whether or not the medication prevents infection, because very few of the study volunteers took the pills regularly. We will be developing and testing a new technology called DOT Diary (D2) that will be used by PrEP study volunteers to take pictures (using their smartphones) of themselves taking their pills, and also using their phones to keep track of their sexual practices. This will allow future studies to provide extra support for study volunteers not taking their medicines regularly, and to figure out whether or not the medications prevent new HIV infections.            ",DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence,9040821,R01MH109320,"['Accounting ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Color ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Data Collection ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Recommendation ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' San Francisco ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Injectable ', ' Schedule ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Ingestion ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Spottings ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Oral ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' meetings ', ' Performance ', ' forgetting ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' Directly Observed Therapy ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' emtricitabine ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Pill ', ' pill (pharmacologic) ', ' Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' efficacy trial ', ' volunteer ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' TB therapy ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment adherence ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' Regimen ', ' young man ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' ']",NIMH,PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES,R01,2015,1079742,0.19280020405405207
"Mentoring Translational Research in HIV DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While significant progress continues to be made, it is not likely that a safe and effective cure or vaccine for HIV will be developed soon.

"The Role of Transcriptional Noise in the Establishment of HIV-1 Latency DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) has the ability to enter a long-lived dormant state, termed proviral latency. Proviral latency is the primay barrier to eradication of HIV-1 from infected individuals, owing to viral reactivation from reservoirs of latently infected cells upon interruption of antiretroviral treatment. It is known tht HIV-1 transcription significantly influences the regulation of HIV-1 latency. The proposed research will utilize high-throughput single-cell measurements to quantify modulated HIV-1 gene expression. A combination of drug perturbations and mutations of cis regulatory elements within the promoter will be used to modulate gene expression and stability of the latent state. Modulations using both approaches will be characterized by high-throughput flow cytometry to measure HIV-1 gene-expression from an array of HIV-1 constructs expressing GFP. Diverse modulations of gene expression will be tested for their ability to reactivate latent HIV as a function of their transcriptional modulation, with the aim of using the data to develop a detailed mechanistic model of transcriptionally driven latency and reactivation. With a deeper mechanistic understanding of latency and the potential discovery of novel reactivating compounds, this research has applications to the fields of HIV, systems biology, and pharmaceutical sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The discovery of a cure for HIV is currently out of reach, hindered by the virus's ability to lay silent in a dormant state within the DNA of a human cell. This inactive or latent state reactivates at a later time, causing elevated levels of HIV, AIDS, an ultimately the death of an infected individual. By building on evidence that latency is heavily influenced by HIV-1 gene expression, this project aims to mechanistically understand how altering viral gene expression affects HIV latent stability using diverse biochemical approaches that modulate its expression and latent reactivation resulting in research of interests to the HIV and systems biology communities.",The Role of Transcriptional Noise in the Establishment of HIV-1 Latency,8762403,F32AI104380,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Preclinical ', ' Evaluation Studies, Drug, Pre-Clinical ', ' Drug Screening ', ' Preclinical Drug Evaluation ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Viral Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Maintenance ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Noise ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Probability ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' hexamethylen bisacetamide ', ' diacetyldiaminohexane ', "" N,N'-hexamethylenebis-acetamide "", "" N,N'-diacetyl-1,6-hexanediamine "", "" N,N'-Hexamethylenebisacetamide "", "" N'-Diacetylhexamethylenediamine N "", ' Hexamethylenediacetamide ', ' Hexamethylenebisacetamide ', ' HMBA ', "" Acetamide, N,N'-1, 6-hexanediylbis- "", ' Hexamethylene Bisacetamide ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' suberanilohydroxamic acid ', ' Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid ', ' SAHA ', ' Vorinostat ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' purging ', ' purge ', ' Modeling ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' drug mechanism ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Mutate ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' reactivation from latency ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high standard ', ' ']",NIAID,J.

"The Interdependency of Drug Resistance Evolution and Drug Design: HIV-1 Protease DESCRIPTION: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies. The pressures of evolution will likely result in a variety of pathways for resistance to evolve. Drug resistance can be caused by a change in the balance of molecular recognition events that selectively weakens inhibitor binding but maintains the biological function of the therapeutic target. To reduce the likelihood of drug resistance, the interdependency of the target's function within the context of the biological system in which it exists must be elucidated. Disrupting the therapeutic target's activity is necessary but not sufficient for avoiding resistance. In this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that key pathways and coupled mechanisms confer drug resistance to therapeutic targets. We seek to define the sequence, structural and dynamic, and temporal evolutionary constraints of the interdependency of drug resistance: 1) to recognize the pathways by which resistance occurs and 2) to devise drug design strategies for developing a drug that is robust against resistance. HIV-1 Protease is the perfect case study! HIV evolves very quickly with on average a point mutation introduced in every third genome replicated. HIV protease inhibitors have the potential of being both very potent and robust to resistance. Protease inhibitors are the only HIV inhibitor class that are transition state analogs and can be evolutionarily constrained within the substrate envelope. Inhibitors that leverage both of these characteristics, such as Darunavir (DRV) and similar analogs, have the potential of being robust, nearly resistance proof inhibitors, to drug- naïve HIV infected patients. If HIV achieves resistance to these inhibitors it is only through complex pathways and combinations of mutations. Further elucidating these complex pathways will bring us closer to resistance-proof inhibitors. In this project our team will use and develop cutting-edge technology to follow the pathways of drug resistance selection, to elucidate the molecular basis for their interdependent patterns and incorporate these mechanisms into drug design strategies. Together we will make inroads into tackling drug resistance that would be impossible for any of us to individually achieve PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies.

"Mining the Social Web to Monitor Public Health and HIV Risk Behaviors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surveillance and monitoring of risk behavior and disease is a top priority of many health-related agencies and organizations, including the UN AIDS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and local public health and epidemiology departments. Identification and localization of changes in risk behaviors and disease can dramatically improve public health outcomes and reduce health-related costs, by providing data on where interventions are needed and how to direct public health efforts. For example, HIV researchers, public health departments, and government organizations, have attempted to identify and monitor HIV risk behavior (e.g., sexual intercourse and illicit drug use) and HIV outbreaks to improve prevention and treatment efforts and curb a growing HIV epidemic. Social media use has been rapidly increasing, and data from these technologies might be leveraged for identification of HIV risk behaviors, such as sexual- and drug-related risk behaviors. Although researchers have developed methods of using social media to monitor HIV and public health behaviors and outcomes, these methods require extensive manual time, technical expertise, and multiple software platforms to process these big data. Advances in technology, including technology infrastructure, data mining, and machine learning approaches, can be leveraged to provide tools that can be used to create a single automated platform for extracting free-text social media conversations, labeling these conversations to identify health risk-related behaviors, and using these labels to monitor disease outbreaks. We propose to create a single automated platform that collects social media (Twitter) data; identifies, codes, and labels tweets that suggest HIV risk behaviors; and provides an output that is acceptable for HIV researchers, public health workers, and policymakers to monitor HIV risk behaviors and outcomes. The tools developed from this application will be open source, tailored for use for epidemiologists and public health departments, and will be available for integration with other software tools to improve the effectiveness of public health monitoring systems.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surveillance and monitoring of health-related risk behavior is a top priority of many agencies and organizations. This project is particularly significant because it seeks to develop software to allow researchers and epidemiologists to analyze real-time free-text conversations from social media to monitor HIV and public health-related risk behaviors and disease outbreaks.

"SNS-based Data Mining to Understand MSM Substance use and HIV Risk Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV incidence among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM) continues to rise, driven in part by substance use. MSM are increasingly using social networking sites (SNS) to find substance use and sexual partners. However, no studies currently exist that use automated, real-time data collection and analysis procedures to monitor substance use and sexual partner seeking across the range of SNS platforms used by MSM to inform intervention development. This project will build on Routine Activities Theory to conduct research using SNS interactions to aid in understanding patterns of substance use and HIV risk behavior among MSM. During Phase 1, focus groups of MSM (n=~8/focus group; N=24) will be used to develop a lexicon for identifying substance use and sexual partner seeking among MSM via diverse SNS platforms. These findings will guide the development of a culturally congruent data collection and mining module (DCMM; internet software that systematically searches SNS to gather data in an analyzable format) with iterative feedback from a community advisory board (CAB) and pilot testing by MSM (n=6). During Phase 2, the DCMM will gather data from 50 MSM on SNS use (e.g., frequency, intensity) substance use and HIV risk/protective behaviors (e.g., content of profiles, postings). Risk behaviors will be assessed weekly via self- report and validated with biomarkers of risk behaviors to be collected at the end of the study period using a rapid oral HIV test and drug test via nail sample. This research will result in a subsequent R34 application to develop and test a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JTAI) using machine learning technology. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: (1) Develop and assess the utility of a culturally congruent DCMM to study the SNS use patterns, substance use and HIV risk and protective behaviors of MSM; (2) Determine associations between patterns of technology use, substance use and HIV risk behaviors among a sample of 50 MSM using a culturally congruent DCMM, self-report data collection and biomarkers for substance use and HIV; and (3) Evaluate the feasibility and the computational requirements of a just-in-time adaptive intervention to reduce substance use and HIV risk behavior among MSM. By devising and testing a culturally congruent DCMM to capture SNS data on MSM substance use and sexual partner seeking this study lays the building blocks to developing technology-based substance use and HIV prevention and treatment efforts tailored specifically for MSM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM) use social networking sites (SNS) to locate substance use and sexual partners, which can increase their risk for HIV acquisition and transmission. This study will devise and test a culturally congruent data collection and mining module (DCMM) to capture large quantities of SNS data on MSM substance use and sexual partner seeking. This formative research has high public health significance as it can clarify the SNS partner seeking dynamics driving MSM's substance use and sexual risk behaviors to inform culturally congruent technology-based substance use and HIV prevention and treatment efforts tailored specifically for MSM.        ",SNS-based Data Mining to Understand MSM Substance use and HIV Risk Behavior,9137371,R03DA039752,"['Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Nails ', ' Nail plate ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Procedures ', ' Phase ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Gays ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' HIV risk ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' NIH Office of AIDS Research ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' oral HIV ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' digital ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' protective behavior ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' drug testing ', ' drug detection ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' social networking website ', ' web-based social networking ', ' social networking web site ', ' social networking site ', ' online social networking ', ' reduced substance use ', ' substance use reduction ', ' reduction in substance use ', ' sexual risk taking ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' social media ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2016,154000,0.17647055419241436
"DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several efficacy trials of pre-exposure prophylaxis (daily antiretroviral therapy to prevent HIV acquisition in uninfected persons with sexual exposures) have failed because of poor adherence to medications. To ensure accurate, longitudinal measurement of pill ingestion with real-time monitoring, we plan to develop DOT Diary (D2), a smartphone application that uses artificial intelligence for measuring pill taking using Directly Observed Therapy. This patented technology will be combined with a daily sexual diary for use in future PrEP observational and efficacy trials. Such an approach provides aggregated data for individual participants, study sites, and trials overall, that facilitates realtime feedback to maximize adherence. We plan a 3 stage process for building and evaluating D2. First, we will assess the assess the reliability and validity of the automated DOT tool to identify attempts to ""cheat"" and over-report pill taking, as well as to evaluate the sensitivity of the measure to detecting 1- to 3-week interruptions in pill use. Second, we will develop and optimize the feasibility and acceptability of D2 for participants and study staff in tracking participation ver time, and providing real-time adherence feedback to study participants. Lastly, we will run a 24-week pilot study of D2 for high-risk men who have sex with men to evaluate the plausibility that this tool can be successfully used to measure and optimize adherence in future PrEP trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many studies of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP (giving an anti-HIV medication to an HIV uninfected person to prevent infection from their HIV positive sex partner) have failed to tell us whether or not the medication prevents infection, because very few of the study volunteers took the pills regularly. We will be developing and testing a new technology called DOT Diary (D2) that will be used by PrEP study volunteers to take pictures (using their smartphones) of themselves taking their pills, and also using their phones to keep track of their sexual practices.

"Mining the Social Web to Monitor Public Health and HIV Risk Behaviors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surveillance and monitoring of risk behavior and disease is a top priority of many health-related agencies and organizations, including the UN AIDS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and local public health and epidemiology departments. Identification and localization of changes in risk behaviors and disease can dramatically improve public health outcomes and reduce health-related costs, by providing data on where interventions are needed and how to direct public health efforts. For example, HIV researchers, public health departments, and government organizations, have attempted to identify and monitor HIV risk behavior (e.g., sexual intercourse and illicit drug use) and HIV outbreaks to improve prevention and treatment efforts and curb a growing HIV epidemic. Social media use has been rapidly increasing, and data from these technologies might be leveraged for identification of HIV risk behaviors, such as sexual- and drug-related risk behaviors. Although researchers have developed methods of using social media to monitor HIV and public health behaviors and outcomes, these methods require extensive manual time, technical expertise, and multiple software platforms to process these big data. Advances in technology, including technology infrastructure, data mining, and machine learning approaches, can be leveraged to provide tools that can be used to create a single automated platform for extracting free-text social media conversations, labeling these conversations to identify health risk-related behaviors, and using these labels to monitor disease outbreaks. We propose to create a single automated platform that collects social media (Twitter) data; identifies, codes, and labels tweets that suggest HIV risk behaviors; and provides an output that is acceptable for HIV researchers, public health workers, and policymakers to monitor HIV risk behaviors and outcomes. The tools developed from this application will be open source, tailored for use for epidemiologists and public health departments, and will be available for integration with other software tools to improve the effectiveness of public health monitoring systems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surveillance and monitoring of health-related risk behavior is a top priority of many agencies and organizations. This project is particularly significant because it seeks to develop software to allow researchers and epidemiologists to analyze real-time free-text conversations from social media to monitor HIV and public health-related risk behaviors and disease outbreaks.

"Routinizing HIV testing for Adolescents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will aim to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using state-of-the-art social media and game technology to increase HIV testing among adolescents and young adults (AYA) ages 13-24. Rates of HIV testing among AYA are low, resulting in high proportions of AYA who are positive or unaware of their HIV infection. Further, public health messages which can be effective in older adults do not achieve the same results in AYA. Since many AYA are highly engaged with social media and games, these technologies may hold the key to reaching this population. While previous behavior change games have shown positive results by using the compelling nature of gameplay to make health education entertaining and shift attitudes towards disease prevention, this intervention proposes to incorporate a new innovation which changes the way video games are used to increase HIV testing and linkage to care. The intended result is a novel social media experience which plays like a game while prompting dialogue about HIV risk assessment, testing, and linkage to care-- in a population more interested in dialogue than in hearing one-way health promotion messages. We hypothesize that the intended result will be both a marketable product and an effective, evidence-based behavioral intervention that increases access to and uptake of HIV testing and linkage to care among AYA. Our multidisciplinary team will recruit AYA to assist in informing the development of a prototype social media game accessible from smartphones, tablets, and the Web. The intervention will be developed with input from AYA, as well as health care providers, to increase acceptability and conduct feasibility testing and revisions to increase game performance and acceptability. During a 6-month period, we will work with AYA to assess the acceptability of the game and its potential impact on perceptions of HIV risk, prevention and testing; perceptions regarding barriers to testing and linkage to care, changes in motivation and readiness to test, and increased self-efficacy regarding health promotion and HIV prevention. We anticipate the results will demonstrate feasibility and provide data to inform a Phase II study to test the efficacy of the game on increasing testing and linkage to care through a larger randomized controlled trial as well as provide a more significant level of feedback on playability, art and animation styles, player engagement, and overall acceptability. Successful completion of these aims will demonstrate how this product may advance the effective implementation of an evidence-based behavioral intervention for increased testing and linkage to care among youth. Successful development of this core technology could also be revised to be applicable to other medical conditions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the feasibility and acceptability of linking young people to HIV testing and care services through social media gameplay. The project focuses on the development of an innovative, culturally-appropriate and youth-appropriate game to help players assess their personal HIV risk through engaging, personalized gameplay. The game rewards players for HIV testing and linkage to care, and sharing the game with others via social networks.        ",Routinizing HIV testing for Adolescents,9147193,R43HD088332,"['Chlamydia

"Immune protection against HIV by induction of CD4+CTLs. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although CD8+ T cells are important in clearing viral infections, many subjects with CD8+ T cell immunodeficiencies have relatively mild disease. CD4+ cytolytic T cells have long been ignored and mistakenly viewed to be senescent cells.

Some data suggests that they cells may be potent at controlling HIV. Our goal in this application is understand the molecular basis for CD4+CTL induction especially in the context of HIV infection and its control.

"The Interdependency of Drug Resistance Evolution and Drug Design: HIV-1 Protease DESCRIPTION: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies. The pressures of evolution will likely result in a variety of pathways for resistance to evolve. Drug resistance can be caused by a change in the balance of molecular recognition events that selectively weakens inhibitor binding but maintains the biological function of the therapeutic target. To reduce the likelihood of drug resistance, the interdependency of the target's function within the context of the biological system in which it exists must be elucidated. Disrupting the therapeutic target's activity is necessary but not sufficient for avoiding resistance. In this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that key pathways and coupled mechanisms confer drug resistance to therapeutic targets. We seek to define the sequence, structural and dynamic, and temporal evolutionary constraints of the interdependency of drug resistance: 1) to recognize the pathways by which resistance occurs and 2) to devise drug design strategies for developing a drug that is robust against resistance. HIV-1 Protease is the perfect case study! HIV evolves very quickly with on average a point mutation introduced in every third genome replicated. HIV protease inhibitors have the potential of being both very potent and robust to resistance. Protease inhibitors are the only HIV inhibitor class that are transition state analogs and can be evolutionarily constrained within the substrate envelope. Inhibitors that leverage both of these characteristics, such as Darunavir (DRV) and similar analogs, have the potential of being robust, nearly resistance proof inhibitors, to drug- naïve HIV infected patients. If HIV achieves resistance to these inhibitors it is only through complex pathways and combinations of mutations. Further elucidating these complex pathways will bring us closer to resistance-proof inhibitors. In this project our team will use and develop cutting-edge technology to follow the pathways of drug resistance selection, to elucidate the molecular basis for their interdependent patterns and incorporate these mechanisms into drug design strategies. Together we will make inroads into tackling drug resistance that would be impossible for any of us to individually achieve PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many studies of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP (giving an anti-HIV medication to an HIV uninfected person to prevent infection from their HIV positive sex partner) have failed to tell us whether or not the medication prevents infection, because very few of the study volunteers took the pills regularly. We will be developing and testing a new technology called DOT Diary (D2) that will be used by PrEP study volunteers to take pictures (using their smartphones) of themselves taking their pills, and also using their phones to keep track of their sexual practices. This will allow future studies to provide extra support for study volunteers not taking their medicines regularly, and to figure out whether or not the medications prevent new HIV infections.",DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence,9325111,R01MH109320,"['Accounting ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Color ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Data Collection ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feedback ', ' Fumarates ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Recommendation ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' San Francisco ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Injectable ', ' Schedule ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Ingestion ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Spottings ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Viread ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Frequencies ', ' Oral ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' meetings ', ' Performance ', ' forgetting ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' Participant ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' Directly Observed Therapy ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' emtricitabine ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' pill ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' efficacy trial ', ' volunteer ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' TB therapy ', ' high risk ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment adherence ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' Regimen ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' dashboard ', ' ']",NIMH,PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES,R01,2016,184571,0.19280020405405207
"The Interdependency of Drug Resistance Evolution and Drug Design: HIV-1 Protease DESCRIPTION: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies. The pressures of evolution will likely result in a variety of pathways for resistance to evolve. Drug resistance can be caused by a change in the balance of molecular recognition events that selectively weakens inhibitor binding but maintains the biological function of the therapeutic target. To reduce the likelihood of drug resistance, the interdependency of the target's function within the context of the biological system in which it exists must be elucidated. Disrupting the therapeutic target's activity is necessary but not sufficient for avoiding resistance. In this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that key pathways and coupled mechanisms confer drug resistance to therapeutic targets. We seek to define the sequence, structural and dynamic, and temporal evolutionary constraints of the interdependency of drug resistance: 1) to recognize the pathways by which resistance occurs and 2) to devise drug design strategies for developing a drug that is robust against resistance. HIV-1 Protease is the perfect case study! HIV evolves very quickly with on average a point mutation introduced in every third genome replicated. HIV protease inhibitors have the potential of being both very potent and robust to resistance. Protease inhibitors are the only HIV inhibitor class that are transition state analogs and can be evolutionarily constrained within the substrate envelope. Inhibitors that leverage both of these characteristics, such as Darunavir (DRV) and similar analogs, have the potential of being robust, nearly resistance proof inhibitors, to drug- naïve HIV infected patients. If HIV achieves resistance to these inhibitors it is only through complex pathways and combinations of mutations. Further elucidating these complex pathways will bring us closer to resistance-proof inhibitors. In this project our team will use and develop cutting-edge technology to follow the pathways of drug resistance selection, to elucidate the molecular basis for their interdependent patterns and incorporate these mechanisms into drug design strategies. Together we will make inroads into tackling drug resistance that would be impossible for any of us to individually achieve PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies.

"Synthetic Molecular Sensors to Target Latently Infected Cells for HIV Eradication DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are no methods currently available for the eradication of the latent reservoir in HIV-infected patients. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop a new method based on synthetic molecular sensors that is capable of targeting latently infected cells in HIV-infected patients for destruction. The objective of this particular application is to design constructs known as ""Synthetic Molecular Sensors for HIV Eradication (SMaSHEd)"" and determine their ability to eradicate latently infected cells from HIV-infected patients or from in vitro latency models. The central hypothesis is that the promoter regions from host genes and the binding sites for miRNAs whose expression can discriminate latently infected from uninfected cells can be used as sensors in SMaSHEd constructs to specifically express a suicide gene in latently infected cells. The rationale for the proposed research is that new methods for eradicating the latent reservoir are required that specifically target latently infected cells, and do not directly target the variable HIV provirus, require activation of HIV replication, or rely on the host immune system to eradicate activated cells. Guided by strong preliminary data, our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1 & 2) Identify genes and miRNAs whose expression can discriminate latently infected primary CD4 T cells from uninfected cells, and (3) Determine the ability of SMaSHEd constructs to induce cell death in latently infected primary CD4 T cells. The analyses in Aim 1 & 2 will utilize RNA-Seq and smallRNA-Seq to identify the genes and miRNAs, respectively that are differentially expressed between latently infected and uninfected primary memory CD4 T cells derived from the in vitro model of our collaborator Dr. Vincente Planelles. Our final aim wil utilize procedures well established in the realm of synthetic biology to design SMaSHEd constructs containing the promoters and miRNA binding sites of genes (Aim 1) and miRNAs (Aim 2), respectively, that specifically sense the environment in latently infected cells. The abilty of these constructs to induce the expression of a suicide gene specifically in latently infected primary CD4 T cells will be assessed following transfection or transduction of mixtures of latently infected and uninfected cells from the in vitro primary CD4 T cell latency model of Dr. Planelles and of Dr. O'Doherty, as well as from HIV-infected patients. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in our opinion, because it will utilize the latest advances in synthetic biology and information gained from next generation sequencing platforms (i.e., RNA-Seq and smallRNA-Seq) to develop a novel method for eradicating latently infected cells. This will be significant because it is the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to lea to the development of a new strategy for the eradication of the latent reservoir in HIV-infected patients. Ultimately, SMaSHEd constructs will be developed for use with appropriate vectors (i.e., adeno-associated virus) for the treatment of HIV-infected patients, where, in contrast to gene therapy, they will only require transient expression to induce the destruction of latently infected cells. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research is relevant to public health since it will develop the knowledge necessary for the design and testing of new therapeutic approaches for the eradication of latently infected cells from HIV-infected patients. Such an approach may eventually lead to a cure for HIV. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIAID's mission that pertains to the better understanding and treatment of infectious diseases.",Synthetic Molecular Sensors to Target

"The oral microbiome and enterosalivary circulation of nitric oxide in HIV. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic HIV is associated with increased risk of pulmonary and cardiovascular complications. Despite use of antiretroviral therapy, rates of even rare vascular complications such as pulmonary hypertension occur upwards of 25 times that in HIV- individuals. The cause for such a high rate of vascular complications in HIV is unknown. Nitric oxide (NO) is a critically important signaling molecule that is produced by the vascular endothelium and acts as a vasodilator and regulator of cardiovascular health. Reduction of nitrate to nitrite and nitric oxide by commensal oral bacteria has recently been implicated in the maintenance of vascular function. The enterosalivary NO pathway is an important component of nitric oxide generation as nitrate is converted to nitrite by a series of bacterial enzymes in the mouth, which is then swallowed and either directly converted to NO or absorbed into the bloodstream where it exerts systemic NO-like effects. The enterosalivary NO pathway depends on viable populations of oral bacteria and helps regulate blood pressure and mitigate vascular injury. However, little is known about the specific bacterial populations involved or the contribution to systemic NO availability and vascular injury and disease. Our preliminary studies suggest that HIV+ individuals have a different profile of oral commensal bacteria (oral microbiome) than HIV- individuals that involves key nitrate reduction pathways. This study proposes the novel hypothesis that the accelerated cardio- and pulmonary vascular disease seen in HIV is due in part to changes in the oral microbiome that favor a disruption of the enterosalivary NO pathway, reduced NO availability, and chronic vascular injury. To test this hypothesis, the oral microbiome of an established cohort of 315 HIV+ and HIV- participants will be characterized using culture-independent sequencing techniques in banked oral wash samples. Expression of specific bacterial nitrate-reducing enzymes will be measured, and results correlated with available serological markers of vascular damage, echocardiographic testing, and radiographic measures of vascular injury. Results will directly inform future clinical enrollment of a prospective trial examining real-time nitrate metabolism, systemic NO distribution, and associated physiological effects. These investigations will offer the first stepsin understanding a novel pathway of HIV-associated vascular disease and inform development of targeted therapies. Additionally, this NRSA award will provide the candidate, a pulmonary medicine fellow, the opportunity for further training in pulmonary vascular medicine and for developing skills in HIV/AIDS and microbiome research. The candidate will acquire extensive training in basic and advanced laboratory techniques, biostatistics, and clinical study design through labwork, conferences, and a master's degree in clinical/translational research. The resources and experience of mentors Dr. Morris, an expert in HIV-related lung disease and the microbiome, and Dr. Gladwin, an expert in NO and pulmonary vascular disease, combined with the expansive array of resources available at the University of Pittsburgh, will support the candidate's successful development.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary vascular and cardiovascular diseases remain a major source of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals in the current era of effective antiretroviral therapy. Reduction of nitrate to nitrite and nitric oxide by commensal oral bacteria has recently been implicated in the maintenance of vascular function. Normal populations of bacteria that live in the mouth are key in maintaining adequate levels of nitric oxide and thus important in vascular function, but these key bacteria may be altered in those with HIV and contribute to excess pulmonary vascular and cardiovascular risk. This proposal will determine changes in the oral microbiome in HIV, the impact of these changes on nitrate reduction pathways, and relationship to markers of vascular function.            ",The

"Optimizing HIV Treatment Monitoring under Resource Constraints ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With escalating global access to HIV antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, treatment failure is inevitable and must be anticipated. Correct and early diagnosis of treatment failure is essential for cost savings, durable response to therapy and prevention of morbidity and mortality. Most HIV treatment programs in the developing world either do not have access to viral load (VL) testing, the gold-standard treatment monitoring modality, or can apply it only on a limited basis. Other monitoring technologies such as drug resistance testing are even less common for financial and infrastructure constraints. In this proposal we will develop, evaluate and implement methods to optimize monitoring of ARV therapy in resource limited settings (RLS) that have diverse VL availability. Though several recent studies have proposed and evaluated lower-cost markers as VL surrogates and strategies for selective VL use, they generally are not based on a formal, decision theoretic framework that allows discovery of strategies with optimality properties that can be expressed in terms of misclassification rate, cost, and other clinically relevant parameters. We propose to develop the statistical framework, theory and methods required to discover optimal diagnostic algorithms for monitoring treatment failure with limited or no VL availability; to use cohort data from both the US and Kenya to derive, calibrate and cross-validate the algorithms; to use extant plasma samples from patients in a PEPFAR-funded HIV care program to design and cross-validate a new diagnostic algorithm that includes implementation of pooled assays; and to develop usable software that will enable programs to design their own protocols based on the characteristics of their patient population and local capacity for viral load testing.

"High-throughput Deep Sequencing Assay to Reliably Measure the HIV Reservoir during Antiretroviral Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study is designed to meet the goals of the RFA ""Innovative assays to quantify the latent HIV reservoir"" that can ""facilitate proof-of-concept studies for curing HIV infection."" To meet this challenge we propose to develop and validate a combined next generation sequencing (Pacific Biosciences single-molecule, real time (SMRT) sequencing) and bioinformatics platform to accurately measure replication-competent provirus (i.e. Proviral Phenotypic Predictor; P3). An over-arching objective would be for the assay to have a ""higher throughput, faster turnaround, lower cost, and greater reproducibility"" than the current standard quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA). We will develop and validate the proposed P3 platform based on international standard procedures for diagnostic molecular methods (i.e. CAP and OIE) using latently infected cells from HIV-infected individuals on optimized antiretroviral therapy for at least 2 years. These participants will be well-characterize to estimated duration of infection at the start of their therapy, and will represent high, medium and low levels of HIV DNA levels. Such characterizations will be necessary to adequately address the dynamic range of the proposed P3 platform. Once P3 methods have been optimized, we will rigorously compare P3 and QVOA methods in their ability to characterize the replication competent proviral reservoir and by costs and turnaround time for results. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal is specifically designed to develop and validate a high-throughput next generation sequencing and bioinformatics platform (P3=""Proviral Phenotypic Predictor"") to fully characterize the latent HIV reservoir through quantification and sequencing of Full-length HIV provirus. We will determine the accuracy and exact error rate for our proposed platform, and we will compare this new assay to the standard quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA) to delineate what amount of intact and replication competent HIV genomes is not inducible (and therefore not recognized) by QVOA. Being able to characterize each part of the HIV DNA population, and especially determine what proportion of intact and replication competent HIV DNA is not inducible by standard QVOA, will allow us to better evaluate the impact of any intervention aimed at reducing the HIV latent reservoir. 1",High-throughput Deep Sequencing Assay to Reliably Measure the HIV Reservoir during Antiretroviral Therapy,9095245,R01AI120009,"['nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Methods ', ' Phaseolus vulgaris Lectins ', ' Kidney Bean Lectins ', ' Phytohemagglutinins ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Proviruses ', ' Rest ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Peripheral ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Stop Codon ', ' Nonsense Codon ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Viral ', ' meetings ', ' PBMC ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' Participant ', ' Appearance ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' single molecule ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Technics ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Methods ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Techniques ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effectiveness analyses ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' International ', ' Interruption ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' Allogenic ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' deep sequencing ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' open source ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' HIV Genome ', ' ']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,766398,0.29035726448441807
"Neuroimmune mechanisms of depression in adults with HIV infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to understand neuroimmune mechanisms of depression in adults with HIV infection through analysis of plasma and CSF exosomes and the relationship of exosome protein cargo to inflammation and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism. Systemic inflammation in HIV infection and other conditions is associated with increased risk of depression through mechanisms involving altered tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism and other unknown mechanisms. Exosomes mediate cell-cell communication during inflammation and other conditions, but their role in neuroimmune interactions involved in depression have not been defined. Preliminary studies showed increased levels of circulating exosomes in HIV patients on ART compared to controls. Moreover, we identified heat shock proteins, Wnt proteins, and other protein cargo in these exosomes that correlate with HIV status, altered tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism, and depressive symptoms. Given that dysregulated Wnt/GSK3-β signaling and inflammatory responses have been linked to depression and other mood disorders, these findings suggest that circulating exosomes may play a role in neuroimmune interactions that impact depression through effects on Wnt/GSK3-β and/or TLR-mediated signaling. To address these questions, we will use clinical samples and data from well characterized HIV+ cohorts followed longitudinally to characterize plasma and CSF exosomes and their relationship to depression, inflammation markers, and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolites. Bioinformatics, computational modeling, and cell culture models will be used to build and test models that predict depression status and relevant pathways. This approach may define novel relationships between circulating exosome cargo and neuroimmune mechanisms of depression in HIV infection, potentially suggesting new therapeutic targets based on the biology of exosomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to understand neuroimmune mechanisms in the biology of depression in HIV infection through analysis of blood and CSF exosomes and their relationship to depressive symptoms, inflammation, and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism in longitudinal cohorts.

"Mining real-time social media big data to monitor HIV: Development and Ethical Issues Social “big data” holds information with wide-ranging implications for addressing issues along the HIV care continuum. Social big data refers to information from social media and online platforms on which individuals and communities create, share, and discuss content. One in four people worldwide, or over a billion people, are publically documenting their activities, intentions, moods, opinions, and social interactions on these sites. They are doing so with increasing volume and velocity, including 400 million “tweets” per day on Twitter and 4.75 billion content items shared per day on Facebook. With an increasing number of these platforms supporting access to publicly-available user data, social big data analysis is a promising new approach for attaining organic observations of behavior that can be used to monitor and predict real-world public health problems, such as HIV incidence. New tools such as social data are therefore needed to supplement existing HIV data collection methods.  In preliminary research, our team developed the first approach that identifies psychological and behavioral characteristics from social big data (>550 million tweets) found to be associated with HIV diagnoses. Since groups at the highest risk for HIV (e.g., minority populations) are the fastest growing Twitter users, and because social media users have been found to publicly share personal information, we identified and collected tweets suggesting HIV risk behaviors (e.g., drug use, high-risk sexual behaviors, etc.) and modeled them alongside CDC statistics on HIV diagnoses. We found a significant positive relationship between HIV- related tweets and county-level HIV cases, controlling for socioeconomic status measures and other variables.  The problem is that this approach is not currently scalable for use by HIV researchers and public health organizations. Although public health agencies are interested in mining social data to address HIV, current tools are not accessible to most health scientists, as the tools require advanced computer science expertise. For example, analyzing 500 million tweets a day requires expertise in big data engineering, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. Developing a single platform for mining social data that has been designed and tested by and for HIV researchers could provide a significant impact on HIV prevention, testing, and treatment. We seek to create a single automated platform that collects social media data; identifies, codes, and labels tweets that suggest HIV-related behaviors; and ultimately predicts regional HIV incidence. Because of the potential ethical issues associated with mining people's data, we also seek to interview staff at local and regional HIV organization and participants affected by HIV to gain their perspectives on the ethical issues associated with this approach. The software developed from this application will be shared with HIV researchers and health care workers to provide additional tools that can be used to combat the spread of HIV.   Project Narrative  Surveillance and monitoring of HIV and related risk behaviors is a top priority. This project is of particularly high impact because it seeks to develop software to allow researchers to analyze real-time conversations from social media big data to monitor HIV diagnoses. It also will provide data on the ethical issues associated with the increasing number of these “social data mining” approaches. The software developed from this application will be shared with HIV researchers and health care workers to provide additional tools that can be used to combat the spread of HIV.",Mining real-time social media big data to monitor HIV: Development and Ethical Issues,9317061,R56AI125105,"['Health Personnel ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Moods ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Social Interaction ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Label ', ' Site ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' interest ', ' behavioral observation ', ' behavior observation ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' case control ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' health organization ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' combat ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' social media ', ' Data Engineering ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R56,2016,671438,0.2312603184102941
"Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in patient-oriented HIV research, seven of whom have secured K funding and four of whom are now R-funded . She is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. Her mentees will have access to a wealth of research opportunities in the context of the many large HIV-focused clinical trials and studies that Dr. Lockman leads (and led over the past 18 years) in Botswana and elsewhere, ranging from randomized trials of antiretroviral or antibiotic regimens (many in pregnant women and their infants) to observational and epidemiologic studies of clinical outcomes among HIV-infected adults and HIV-exposed children. In the proposed K24, she will leverage the unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a large ongoing randomized HIV combination prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000 with longitudinal cohort of 12,000 adults), in order to mentor investigators from Botswana and the US on pressing questions of substantial public health and clinical relevance to the severe epidemic still affecting sub-Saharan Africa. For context, UNAIDS is promoting high levels (90% or greater) of HIV diagnosis, antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage, and virologic suppression (“90-90-90” targets) to end the HIV epidemic. However, despite nearly meeting these targets in Botswana, we observe annual HIV incidence >1%. Furthermore, with more than 15% of the adult population of Botswana on ART (and recent implementation of universal ART), it is essential that we understand the implications of widespread treatment for clinical outcomes and non-communicable disease incidence in persons living with HIV at the population level. We will therefore: a) Characterize adults with recent HIV infection using predictive analysis, in order to identify groups at highest risk for HIV acquisition in the current epidemic, and augment our understanding with individual in-depth interviews with recently- infected adults; b) Study the feasibility, acceptability, and uptake of a targeted approach to TDF/FTC pre- exposure prophylaxis, offered to HIV-negative persons meeting this high-risk profile; c) Evaluate the impact of HIV (and of early ART) on clinical outcomes, including c ancer incidence and hypertension prevalence in HIV-infected vs. HIV-uninfected adults, and HIV-related outcomes among persons starting dolutegravir- vs. efavirenz-based ART. In addition, Dr. Lockman will also mentor junior investigators on projects nested within a new large randomized IMPAACT trial of 3 antiretroviral regimens in pregnancy that that she leads, and in prior large perinatal HIV studies in Botswana that enrolled more than 9,000 mother-infant pairs. This K24 is critical, to support the protected time and resources that are required for Dr. Lockman to mentor junior investigators from both the US and Botswana in patient-oriented research. NARRATIVE Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in global patient-oriented HIV research (many of whom have gone on to conduct funded research of their own), and is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. In this project, she will harness unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a randomized HIV prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000), in order to study questions of major public health importance in the new reality of universal antiretroviral treatment (regardless of HIV disease stage)--namely, whether it is feasible and acceptable to identify and offer proven HIV prevention interventions to HIV-negative persons at high risk for acquiring HIV; and what the longer-term health implications of HIV (and of universal treatment) are, for the health of HIV-infected and –uninfected people (including hypertension and cancer risk).",Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial,9349125,K24AI131928,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Bechuanaland ', ' Botswana ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Circumcision ', ' Male Circumcision ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epidemic ', ' Faculty ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Household ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mentors ', ' Mothers ', ' Persons ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' virology ', ' Measures ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Peripartum ', ' Perinatal ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' Outcome Study ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' cancer risk ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' efavirenz ', ' treatment program ', ' Prevention ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' emtricitabine ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' point of care ', ' community intervention ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' high risk ', ' HIV prevention trial ', ' population based ', ' IMPAACT ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Regimen ', ' Secure ', ' Prevention trial ', ' trial design ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' ']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2017,190858,0.380206186955001
"Implementing and Evaluating a Machine Learning Tool for Entity Resolution in Drug Use and Sexual Contact Networks of YMSM Project Summary Efforts to integrate contact network data with molecular surveillance data provide enormous promise for HIV tracking and intervention. However, the lack of tools to facilitate integrated molecular-social surveillance remains a substantial barrier to progress. For example, most contact network data only contains information on the immediate sexual and drug use partners of a single individual. Yet, the same partners can appear across the contact networks of multiple individuals. Therefore, partners must be matched across contact networks - a process called entity resolution (ER) - in order to provide an accurate view of the overall contact network structure. The process of ER currently requires either substantial resources to manually match individuals or considerable technological expertise in programming to more efficiently match individuals using probabilistic models. Accordingly, this project will 1) develop a machine learning algorithm to match individuals across personal contact networks and validate it using a large existing dataset of young men who have sex with men, and 2) create a graphical user interface to implement the algorithm as an add-on package to an existing tool for network data capture and processing (Network Canvas). The results of this project will provide an open- source and freely available tool that can drastically reduce barriers to matching individuals across contact networks, thereby providing researchers and public health officials with unencumbered access to the underlying structure of drug use and sexual networks, and a potent tool for integrating contact network data with molecular surveillance. Project Narrative Developing an accurate picture of the drug use and sexual contact networks of men who have sex with men (MSM) and other high risk populations can revolutionize the way in which HIV spread is tracked and intervened upon by public health practitioners. However, these data are usually limited to personal networks, which only include immediate sex and drug use partners. The current project will employ state-of-the-art methods in machine learning to improve the accuracy of matching individuals across personal network data and will integrate this tool into a user-friendly graphical user interface and data management tool, thereby substantially reducing barriers to studying contact networks and providing a potent tool for HIV surveillance and interventions.",Implementing and Evaluating a Machine Learning Tool for Entity Resolution in Drug Use and Sexual Contact Networks of YMSM,9348928,R21LM012578,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Data Collection ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Logic ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Phylogeny ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' computer human interaction ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' disease transmission ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Graph ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' drug structure ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Resolution ', ' Subgroup ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' graphical user interface ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' usability ', ' surveillance data ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2017,219102,0.16988874214899286
"Mining the Social Web to Monitor Public Health and HIV Risk Behaviors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surveillance and monitoring of risk behavior and disease is a top priority of many health-related agencies and organizations, including the UN AIDS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and local public health and epidemiology departments. Identification and localization of changes in risk behaviors and disease can dramatically improve public health outcomes and reduce health-related costs, by providing data on where interventions are needed and how to direct public health efforts. For example, HIV researchers, public health departments, and government organizations, have attempted to identify and monitor HIV risk behavior (e.g., sexual intercourse and illicit drug use) and HIV outbreaks to improve prevention and treatment efforts and curb a growing HIV epidemic. Social media use has been rapidly increasing, and data from these technologies might be leveraged for identification of HIV risk behaviors, such as sexual- and drug-related risk behaviors. Although researchers have developed methods of using social media to monitor HIV and public health behaviors and outcomes, these methods require extensive manual time, technical expertise, and multiple software platforms to process these big data. Advances in technology, including technology infrastructure, data mining, and machine learning approaches, can be leveraged to provide tools that can be used to create a single automated platform for extracting free-text social media conversations, labeling these conversations to identify health risk-related behaviors, and using these labels to monitor disease outbreaks. We propose to create a single automated platform that collects social media (Twitter) data; identifies, codes, and labels tweets that suggest HIV risk behaviors; and provides an output that is acceptable for HIV researchers, public health workers, and policymakers to monitor HIV risk behaviors and outcomes. The tools developed from this application will be open source, tailored for use for epidemiologists and public health departments, and will be available for integration with other software tools to improve the effectiveness of public health monitoring systems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surveillance and monitoring of health-related risk behavior is a top priority of many agencies and organizations. This project is particularly significant because it seeks to develop software to allow researchers and epidemiologists to analyze real-time free-text conversations from social media to monitor HIV and public health-related risk behaviors and disease outbreaks.

"She's PrEPared: The Impact of Intimate Partner Violence on Women's Engagement in the PrEP Care Continuum Project Summary/Abstract A significant relationship exists between intimate partner violence (IPV) and HIV. IPV-exposed women are almost 10 times more likely to report an HIV infection. Extant research indicates multiple direct (e.g., forced sex with risky partner) and indirect (e.g., poor mental health) pathways linking IPV experiences to HIV risk. Developing ways to prevent HIV among IPV-exposed women that is not partner-dependent is needed. Pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), is a daily oral medication and may be the most viable and novel HIV prevention option for IPV-exposed women. However, engaging in PrEP care can be hard including multiple steps (e.g., daily adherence, quarterly medical visits). Women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum may be disrupted by four HIV-related risk factors (economic instability, sexual autonomy, substance abuse, depressive symptoms). First, economic instability can make women dependent on their abusive partner for money and insurance, which may hinder PrEP uptake and adherence. Second, women with low sexual autonomy (e.g., freedom to express one's sexual self) may feel unable or uncomfortable using PrEP if her partner disagree with her wish to use PrEP, which can prevent PrEP uptake. Lastly, substance abuse and feelings of depression can disrupt cognition, making it difficult to engage in daily functions, which may prevent PrEP adherence. To date, there is a dearth of studies examining the implications of IPV on women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum, despite the potential barriers associated with IPV. This is concerning since the Trans-NIH HIV- Related Research Priorities called for research addressing how violence influences experiences along the HIV prevention continuum. This F31 aims to improve the sexual health of women across these research aims: (1a) Examine the effects of IPV on women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum (i.e., interest, uptake, adherence, follow-up visits), and HIV-related risk factors using data from a cohort study of women (n=250); (1b) Explore four HIV-related risk factors as mediators linking IPV and the PrEP care continuum; and (2) Describe women's experiences and processes along the PrEP care continuum (n=32). The proposed research addresses a critical need to understand the relationship between IPV and women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum in order to implement PrEP care in a safe and effective way. This research will devise PrEP engagement strategies, inform intervention development, and help the fight against HIV/AIDS for women. During this 2-year research and training fellowship, the applicant will develop interdisciplinary social science skills including advancing statistical analysis skills, gaining experience in mixed-methods study design and qualitative data analysis, while refining academic and scientific communication. This comprehensive training program will prepare the applicant for a career as an independent violence epidemiologist and academic mentor conducting empirical IPV research while designing HIV prevention interventions with for women. Project Narrative Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be a viable option for IPV-exposed women, but the impact of IPV on women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum is unclear. This study seeks to use mixed methods to understand if and how IPV impacts women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum.",She's PrEPared: The Impact of Intimate Partner Violence on Women's Engagement in the PrEP Care Continuum,9410681,F31MH113508,"['Affect ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communication ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fellowship ', ' Liberty ', ' Freedom ', ' Future ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Forcible intercourse ', ' forced sex ', ' Rape ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Federal Aids ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Oral ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Safe Sex ', ' safer sexual behavior ', ' safer sex ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Protected Sex ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' fight against ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' daily functioning ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,44044,0.11015008550834689
"High-throughput Deep Sequencing Assay to Reliably Measure the HIV Reservoir during Antiretroviral Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study is designed to meet the goals of the RFA ""Innovative assays to quantify the latent HIV reservoir"" that can ""facilitate proof-of-concept studies for curing HIV infection."" To meet this challenge we propose to develop and validate a combined next generation sequencing (Pacific Biosciences single-molecule, real time (SMRT) sequencing) and bioinformatics platform to accurately measure replication-competent provirus (i.e. Proviral Phenotypic Predictor; P3). An over-arching objective would be for the assay to have a ""higher throughput, faster turnaround, lower cost, and greater reproducibility"" than the current standard quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA). We will develop and validate the proposed P3 platform based on international standard procedures for diagnostic molecular methods (i.e. CAP and OIE) using latently infected cells from HIV-infected individuals on optimized antiretroviral therapy for at least 2 years. These participants will be well-characterize to estimated duration of infection at the start of their therapy, and will represent high, medium and low levels of HIV DNA levels. Such characterizations will be necessary to adequately address the dynamic range of the proposed P3 platform. Once P3 methods have been optimized, we will rigorously compare P3 and QVOA methods in their ability to characterize the replication competent proviral reservoir and by costs and turnaround time for results. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal is specifically designed to develop and validate a high-throughput next generation sequencing and bioinformatics platform (P3=""Proviral Phenotypic Predictor"") to fully characterize the latent HIV reservoir through quantification and sequencing of Full-length HIV provirus. We will determine the accuracy and exact error rate for our proposed platform, and we will compare this new assay to the standard quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA) to delineate what amount of intact and replication competent HIV genomes is not inducible (and therefore not recognized) by QVOA. Being able to characterize each part of the HIV DNA population, and especially determine what proportion of intact and replication competent HIV DNA is not inducible by standard QVOA, will allow us to better evaluate the impact of any intervention aimed at reducing the HIV latent reservoir. 1",High-throughput Deep Sequencing Assay to Reliably Measure the HIV Reservoir during Antiretroviral Therapy,9189589,R01AI120009,"['Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Methods ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phytohemagglutinins ', ' Phaseolus vulgaris Lectins ', ' Kidney Bean Lectins ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Proviruses ', ' Rest ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Stop Codon ', ' Nonsense Codon ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Viral ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' PBMC ', ' expression cloning ', ' Participant ', ' Appearance ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' single molecule ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Techniques ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Technics ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Methods ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effectiveness analyses ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' International ', ' Interruption ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' Allogenic ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' deep sequencing ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' open source ', ' public health relevance ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' HIV Genome ', ' viral rebound ', ' virus rebound ', ' ']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,758646,0.29035726448441807
"SNS-based Data Mining to Understand MSM Substance use and HIV Risk Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV incidence among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM) continues to rise, driven in part by substance use. MSM are increasingly using social networking sites (SNS) to find substance use and sexual partners. However, no studies currently exist that use automated, real-time data collection and analysis procedures to monitor substance use and sexual partner seeking across the range of SNS platforms used by MSM to inform intervention development. This project will build on Routine Activities Theory to conduct research using SNS interactions to aid in understanding patterns of substance use and HIV risk behavior among MSM. During Phase 1, focus groups of MSM (n=~8/focus group; N=24) will be used to develop a lexicon for identifying substance use and sexual partner seeking among MSM via diverse SNS platforms. These findings will guide the development of a culturally congruent data collection and mining module (DCMM; internet software that systematically searches SNS to gather data in an analyzable format) with iterative feedback from a community advisory board (CAB) and pilot testing by MSM (n=6). During Phase 2, the DCMM will gather data from 50 MSM on SNS use (e.g., frequency, intensity) substance use and HIV risk/protective behaviors (e.g., content of profiles, postings). Risk behaviors will be assessed weekly via self- report and validated with biomarkers of risk behaviors to be collected at the end of the study period using a rapid oral HIV test and drug test via nail sample. This research will result in a subsequent R34 application to develop and test a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JTAI) using machine learning technology. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: (1) Develop and assess the utility of a culturally congruent DCMM to study the SNS use patterns, substance use and HIV risk and protective behaviors of MSM; (2) Determine associations between patterns of technology use, substance use and HIV risk behaviors among a sample of 50 MSM using a culturally congruent DCMM, self-report data collection and biomarkers for substance use and HIV; and (3) Evaluate the feasibility and the computational requirements of a just-in-time adaptive intervention to reduce substance use and HIV risk behavior among MSM. By devising and testing a culturally congruent DCMM to capture SNS data on MSM substance use and sexual partner seeking this study lays the building blocks to developing technology-based substance use and HIV prevention and treatment efforts tailored specifically for MSM.

"The Interdependency of Drug Resistance Evolution and Drug Design: HIV-1 Protease DESCRIPTION: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies. The pressures of evolution will likely result in a variety of pathways for resistance to evolve. Drug resistance can be caused by a change in the balance of molecular recognition events that selectively weakens inhibitor binding but maintains the biological function of the therapeutic target. To reduce the likelihood of drug resistance, the interdependency of the target's function within the context of the biological system in which it exists must be elucidated. Disrupting the therapeutic target's activity is necessary but not sufficient for avoiding resistance. In this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that key pathways and coupled mechanisms confer drug resistance to therapeutic targets. We seek to define the sequence, structural and dynamic, and temporal evolutionary constraints of the interdependency of drug resistance: 1) to recognize the pathways by which resistance occurs and 2) to devise drug design strategies for developing a drug that is robust against resistance. HIV-1 Protease is the perfect case study! HIV evolves very quickly with on average a point mutation introduced in every third genome replicated. HIV protease inhibitors have the potential of being both very potent and robust to resistance. Protease inhibitors are the only HIV inhibitor class that are transition state analogs and can be evolutionarily constrained within the substrate envelope. Inhibitors that leverage both of these characteristics, such as Darunavir (DRV) and similar analogs, have the potential of being robust, nearly resistance proof inhibitors, to drug- naïve HIV infected patients. If HIV achieves resistance to these inhibitors it is only through complex pathways and combinations of mutations. Further elucidating these complex pathways will bring us closer to resistance-proof inhibitors. In this project our team will use and develop cutting-edge technology to follow the pathways of drug resistance selection, to elucidate the molecular basis for their interdependent patterns and incorporate these mechanisms into drug design strategies. Together we will make inroads into tackling drug resistance that would be impossible for any of us to individually achieve PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies.

"Optimizing HIV Treatment Monitoring under Resource Constraints ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With escalating global access to HIV antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, treatment failure is inevitable and must be anticipated. Correct and early diagnosis of treatment failure is essential for cost savings, durable response to therapy and prevention of morbidity and mortality. Most HIV treatment programs in the developing world either do not have access to viral load (VL) testing, the gold-standard treatment monitoring modality, or can apply it only on a limited basis. Other monitoring technologies such as drug resistance testing are even less common for financial and infrastructure constraints. In this proposal we will develop, evaluate and implement methods to optimize monitoring of ARV therapy in resource limited settings (RLS) that have diverse VL availability. Though several recent studies have proposed and evaluated lower-cost markers as VL surrogates and strategies for selective VL use, they generally are not based on a formal, decision theoretic framework that allows discovery of strategies with optimality properties that can be expressed in terms of misclassification rate, cost, and other clinically relevant parameters. We propose to develop the statistical framework, theory and methods required to discover optimal diagnostic algorithms for monitoring treatment failure with limited or no VL availability; to use cohort data from both the US and Kenya to derive, calibrate and cross-validate the algorithms; to use extant plasma samples from patients in a PEPFAR-funded HIV care program to design and cross-validate a new diagnostic algorithm that includes implementation of pooled assays; and to develop usable software that will enable programs to design their own protocols based on the characteristics of their patient population and local capacity for viral load testing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Effective use of antiretroviral therapy is critical for managing and preventing the spread of HIV in the developing world. This proposal develops methods that make optimal use of diagnostic tests having limited availability to monitor the effectiveness of therapy and to prompt a change in regimen when it is warranted.

"Big Data Analysis of HIV Risk and Epidemiology in Sub-Saharan Africa Project Summary/Abstract HIV is the largest single cause of death among adults in Sub-Saharan Africa, responsible for about a third of all deaths among adults. One of the key paradigms to halting HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa relies on identification of infected individuals and populations for delivery of biomedical and behavioral interventions. However, by the end of 2015 less that half of HIV-infected individuals accessed antiretroviral therapy (ART) despite expansion of eligibility and ongoing efforts to diagnose and initiate treatment. A better understanding of the social, behavioral, environmental, and economic contexts that influence HIV risk could improve the effectiveness and efficiency of programs that aim to identify and target HIV-infected populations. In response to the program announcement for “Harnessing Big Data to Halt HIV” (PA-15-273), the overall goal of this proposal is to develop new analytic tools in large-scale data to predict risk of HIV infection and to generate hypotheses about new or under-recognized risk factors in Sub-Saharan Africa. We plan four primary investigations: (1) Extract and harmonize all Sub- Saharan African nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys that include the HIV status of over 600,000 men and women collected in 29 countries, and hundreds to thousands of associated exposure variables; (2) Develop analytic tools based on LASSO and XWAS to predict HIV infection status and generate hypotheses about social, behaviorial, environmental, an economic risk factors; (3) Identify HIV risk in multi-country, large-scale data and synthesize findings across in Sub-Saharan Africa, and (4) develop a bioethics program to identify targets for new interventions and policies in a culturally and ethically sound manner. The project will develop leverage big data and high-throughput analytic methodology in the service of global HIV control. The outputs of this project include (1) accessible software code for efficient exploration of robust correlates of HIV status derived from the biggest collection of high-dimensional, harmonized, and nationally representative representative household surveys in the world, (2) an extensive landscape of the social, environmental, behavioral, and economic factors predictive of HIV infection among over 600K people tested for HIV in 29 Sub- Saharan countries, and (3) a ethical framework to enable practical, relevant, and appropriate translation and communication of findings. New models of HIV infection will facilitate identification of at-risk groups and the development of interventions to halt the HIV epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa. Project Narrative Advancing the the public health goals for global HIV, including the “AIDS-Free Generation” and “90-90- 90,” requires effective identification of HIV-infected individuals. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop new analytic tools to (1) predict HIV status using modern tools of statistical machine learning and (2) uncover new and under-recognized risk factors for HIV infection in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using person-level data including the HIV status of over 600,000 men and women collected in nationally representative household surveys from 29 countries, we propose to build a high-throughput statistical predictor of HIV status and apply a novel “X-wide association study” (XWAS) to search for and validate social, behavioral, environmental, and economic factors associated with HIV seropositivity. Through development of an ethical/decision making framework and with close consult of an advisory committee, the findings will be used to develop both broad and specific insights about risk factors and at-risk populations for improving HIV care and epidemiology.",Big Data Analysis of HIV Risk and Epidemiology in Sub-Saharan Africa,9349034,R01AI127250,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Algorithms ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Bioethics ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communication ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Analysis ', ' Demographic Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Goals ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Household ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Persons ', ' Program Efficiency ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' sound ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Privacy ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Demographic and Health Surveys ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Country ', ' Consult ', ' Services ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Bioethics Consultants ', ' Bioethicist ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' behavioral economics ', ' high dimensionality ', ' ']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,691929,0.35691819003825265
"Prediction of heart failure in HIV-infected individuals 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Half of those living with HIV in the U.S. are or will soon be >50 years of age. Heart failure, which has one of the highest disease burdens of any age-related condition nationwide, may soon become the most costly HIV- related comorbidity in terms of premature mortality, suffering, and healthcare expenditures. Many of its known risk factors are common to HIV-infected and uninfected individuals alike, but less is known about its pathogenesis in the context of suppressive HIV therapy. New evidence suggests that long-term survival with HIV is associated with greater risks for systolic and diastolic dysfunction as well as resultant heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Against a background of high diabetes, hypertension, and obesity risk in minority groups affected disproportionately by HIV, a unique set of etiologic and prognostic factors for heart failure in the context of HIV infection likely exists. The proposed research is a set of epidemiologic studies characterizing the role of HIV infection in heart failure incidence and survival, based on data from the largest HIV care provider in the Bronx, NY. Aim 1 will assess the association between HIV infection and heart failure incidence, and Aim 1b will identify risk factors, including major comorbidities, that may lead to greater mortality in optimally treated HIV-infected heart failure patients compared with HIV-uninfected heart failure patients. Aims 2 and 3 will implement machine learning methods within our longitudinal electronic medical record database to construct prediction models identifying HIV+ patients at greatest risk of developing HF, and to identify unique HIV-specific phenotypes of HFpEF and HFrEF. Prediction models developed in our clinical population (90% minority, 40% female) will be validated in a demographically complementary HIV+ cohort in Chicago (50% minority, 15% female) to evaluate the transportability of these models across patient populations. This award will provide ample training opportunities for the candidate to continue his progression to an independent academic research career with specialized experience at the intersection of HIV, cardiovascular disease, and medical informatics. Established institutional resources and a mentoring team with a proven record of success, as well as research conducted within a geographic area with endemic levels of HIV and heart disease, provide an ideal setting to successfully produce high quality research with major impact. The collaboration will establish a program for large-scale translational research in HIV and heart failure by developing a shared research platform between two major research institutions in the Bronx and Chicago. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heart failure imposes one of the highest disease burdens of any condition in the U.S., with over 6 million Americans affected, and costs reaching $34 billion annually. The extent to which it affects people living with HIV is currently unclear but of critical importance, due to the aging of the population as a result of successful antiretroviral therapy. Our work will allow for the prediction of heart failure risk in people living with HIV and identify unique heart failure phenotypes in the context of HIV infection, both of which may help to tailor

"Tough Talks: A Disclosure Intervention for HIV+ YMSM PROJECT SUMMARY Men who have sex with men (MSM) account for nearly two-thirds all of new HIV infections in the United States (US) and young MSM (YMSM) are the only risk group experiencing a significant increase in HIV incidence. Among youth, 67 percent report not disclosing to their first time sex partners.4 Disclosing of one’s HIV status is important for accessing support which can lead to improved medication adherence and retention in care. Those who disclose are more likely to use condoms with uninfected sex partners5 and mathematical modeling estimates that increased HIV status disclosure to sex partners may reduce transmissions by 40-60%.6,7 Further, disclosure may motivate uninfected sex partners to seek testing and reduce their own HIV transmission behaviors. Given the potential benefits and challenges associated with disclosure, there is a need for sophisticated interventions that can assist MSM, with the disclosure process. Virtual reality provides a unique environment for users to practice HIV disclosure. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven disclosure may offer advantages over in-person role play through the use of realistic avatars that represent potential romantic partners, and probabilistic settings where users envision having disclosure conversations. Users have the opportunity to practice disclosing and experience a variety of responses and outcomes. During Phase I of this project we developed an iPad based virtual reality system that features three avatars, two virtual locations and three disclosure scenarios which represent a variety of common disclosure experiences and contexts experienced by YMSM. In Phase II we will further enhance Tough Talks and develop a full-feature automated version to test via a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) through the newly created Center for Innovative Technologies (iTech) across the Prevention and Care Continuum, an NIH-funded center to support adolescent HIV research. The aims of this Phase II SBIR are: 1) Refine and enhance the current Tough Talks disclosure scenarios to include additional content, characters and virtual environments. Formative work with YMSM (aged 16-29 years) will inform development and we will work with a leader in AI software to incorporate natural language into the AI driven scenarios; 2) Develop the Tough Talks stand-alone intervention. This fully automated intervention will include the AI driven disclosure scenarios created in aim 1 as well as a virtual disclosure coach to guide participants through the intervention goal-setting interactive exercises and interactive educational videos. Following development, a technical pilot to optimize functionality and technical performance will be conducted with 8-10 YMSM and; 3) Conduct a three-arm combined efficacy/effectiveness trial to compare the intervention delivered online (Arm 1) versus in the clinic (Arm 2) compared to standard of care (SOC) disclosure messaging only. Primary outcomes of HIV viral load and condomless anal intercourse (CAI) will be assessed at intervention completion (1 month) and at 6-month follow-up. We will estimate transmissions averted and program costs of each arm (Months 19-36). PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite monumental advances in HIV treatment and prevention technologies, disclosing a positive HIV status to an intimate partner remains a daunting and a complex undertaking. However, those who disclose are more likely to use condoms with uninfected sex partners and mathematical modeling estimates that increased HIV status disclosure to sex partners may reduce transmissions by 40-60%. Further, disclosing of one’s HIV status is important for accessing support which can lead to improved retention in care, antiretroviral adherence and decreased viral load. During Phase I of this project we developed an iPad based virtual reality system that features three virtual characters, two virtual locations and three disclosure scenarios which represent a variety of common disclosure experiences and contexts experienced by YMSM. In Phase II we will further refine and enhance Tough Talks and develop a full-feature version to test via a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT).",Tough Talks: A Disclosure Intervention for HIV+ YMSM,9348065,R44MH104102,"['Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' innovative technologies ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' technology development ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' virtual reality ', ' virtual world ', ' virtual environment ', ' VR simulation ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Adherence ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' systematic review ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' aged ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' natural language ', ' arm ', ' eHealth ', ' e-Health ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' ']",NIMH,"VIRTUALLY BETTER, INC.",R44,2017,503771,0.315793580010088
"Big Data analytics of HIV treatment gaps in South Carolina: Identification and prediction Project Summary/Abstract. Early HIV diagnosis as well as linkage into and retention in HIV medical care for HIV+ individuals is important for patient survival and treatment. Missed opportunities for early HIV diagnosis continues even with recommended routine HIV testing. National and South Carolina (SC) estimates of retention in HIV medical care are slightly above fifty percent, indicating a gap in HIV treatment. With significant proportions of HIV+ individuals not receiving HIV medical care, improved outcomes of care and HIV prevention as part of national HIV/AIDs strategies are difficult to achieve. The purpose of this study is to use novel machine learning algorithms to further explore, identify, characterize, and explain predictors of missed opportunities for HIV medical care utilization among all living HIV+ individuals in SC. Profiles of HIV+ individuals based on their patterns of HIV medical care seeking behavior will be developed with concomitant identification of both gaps in HIV care and missed opportunities for reengagement into HIV care. Health utilization behavior for HIV+ individuals' pre-HIV diagnosis also will be studied to identify where missed opportunities for HIV testing occurs. Findings will be integrated with the ongoing effort of the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC)'s Data-to-Care (DTC) program as well as the Ryan White Care Program. The public health value that HIV treatment brings includes improved survival outcomes of care among HIV+ individuals as well as reduced HIV transmission. These important components form part of the overall strategy for fighting and controlling the HIV epidemic in the United States and aligns closely with the strategic goals of reducing new HIV infections. Using state-level CD4 and Viral Load (VL) testing data available for all SC HIV+ individuals since 2004, the study will link inpatient and outpatient claims data sources, the state electronic HIV/AIDS reporting system, Area Health Resource Files, and data from the state corrections database to create a unique population based dataset spanning 10 years (2004-2013). Advanced Big Data analytical algorithms will be used to create person-level profile patterns of pre- and post- HIV diagnosis health utilization behaviors and for identifying best predictors of linkage and retention in HIV medical care. These algorithms will be useful in unearthing hidden features/predictors of HIV medical care utilization. A predictive model useful for predicting where HIV+ individuals who are not in care will access routine medical care (missed opportunities) also will be developed. Findings will provide fresh guidance for public health interventions targeting early HIV testing and linkage to and retention in HIV medical care for SC HIV-infected individuals. Project Narrative. Treatment as a public health strategy of HIV prevention is important in fighting the national HIV epidemic. Early diagnosis, linkage to, and retention in HIV medical care are key public health strategies for HIV prevention. Missed opportunities for HIV diagnosis as well as inadequate HIV medical care utilization by HIV+ individuals in South Carolina negatively impacts HIV survival outcomes, while increasing population transmission risks. The analyses of population-based health utilization data for HIV+ individuals using powerful machine learning techniques such as deep learning algorithms will generate new factors useful for improving retention in HIV care. This valuable new information will be translated into ongoing efforts such as SC's Data-to Care and Ryan White care efforts through improved targeting of HIV medical care engagement and reengagement interventions.",Big Data analytics of HIV treatment gaps in South Carolina: Identification and prediction,9404773,R01AI127203,"['Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Data Sources ', ' Dropout ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Resources ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Persons ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' South Carolina ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' fighting ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' care seeking ', ' intervention program ', ' novel ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Drops ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Predictive Value ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' surveillance data ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' public health intervention ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Data Analytics ', ' improved outcome ', ' survival outcome ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2017,655554,0.40224731787593315
"DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several efficacy trials of pre-exposure prophylaxis (daily antiretroviral therapy to prevent HIV acquisition in uninfected persons with sexual exposures) have failed because of poor adherence to medications. To ensure accurate, longitudinal measurement of pill ingestion with real-time monitoring, we plan to develop DOT Diary (D2), a smartphone application that uses artificial intelligence for measuring pill taking using Directly Observed Therapy. This patented technology will be combined with a daily sexual diary for use in future PrEP observational and efficacy trials. Such an approach provides aggregated data for individual participants, study sites, and trials overall, that facilitates realtime feedback to maximize adherence. We plan a 3 stage process for building and evaluating D2. First, we will assess the assess the reliability and validity of the automated DOT tool to identify attempts to ""cheat"" and over-report pill taking, as well as to evaluate the sensitivity of the measure to detecting 1- to 3-week interruptions in pill use. Second, we will develop and optimize the feasibility and acceptability of D2 for participants and study staff in tracking participation ver time, and providing real-time adherence feedback to study participants. Lastly, we will run a 24-week pilot study of D2 for high-risk men who have sex with men to evaluate the plausibility that this tool can be successfully used to measure and optimize adherence in future PrEP trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many studies of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP (giving an anti-HIV medication to an HIV uninfected person to prevent infection from their HIV positive sex partner) have failed to tell us whether or not the medication prevents infection, because very few of the study volunteers took the pills regularly. We will be developing and testing a new technology called DOT Diary (D2) that will be used by PrEP study volunteers to take pictures (using their smartphones) of themselves taking their pills, and also using their phones to keep track of their sexual practices. This will allow future studies to provide extra support for study volunteers not taking their medicines regularly, and to figure out whether or not the medications prevent new HIV infections.",DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence,9319810,R01MH109320,"['Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Color ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Data Collection ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feedback ', ' Fumarates ', ' Future ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Phonation ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Recommendation ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' San Francisco ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Injectable ', ' Schedule ', ' Custom ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Ingestion ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Measurement ', ' Spottings ', ' tool ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Frequencies ', ' Oral ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Infection prevention ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Performance ', ' forgetting ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Participant ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Reporting ', ' Directly Observed Therapy ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' emtricitabine ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' pill ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' efficacy trial ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' volunteer ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' TB therapy ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment adherence ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' Regimen ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' dashboard ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' ']",NIMH,PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES,R01,2017,992570,0.19280020405405207
"Neuroimmune mechanisms of depression in adults with HIV infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to understand neuroimmune mechanisms of depression in adults with HIV infection through analysis of plasma and CSF exosomes and the relationship of exosome protein cargo to inflammation and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism. Systemic inflammation in HIV infection and other conditions is associated with increased risk of depression through mechanisms involving altered tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism and other unknown mechanisms. Exosomes mediate cell-cell communication during inflammation and other conditions, but their role in neuroimmune interactions involved in depression have not been defined. Preliminary studies showed increased levels of circulating exosomes in HIV patients on ART compared to controls. Moreover, we identified heat shock proteins, Wnt proteins, and other protein cargo in these exosomes that correlate with HIV status, altered tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism, and depressive symptoms. Given that dysregulated Wnt/GSK3-β signaling and inflammatory responses have been linked to depression and other mood disorders, these findings suggest that circulating exosomes may play a role in neuroimmune interactions that impact depression through effects on Wnt/GSK3-β and/or TLR-mediated signaling. To address these questions, we will use clinical samples and data from well characterized HIV+ cohorts followed longitudinally to characterize plasma and CSF exosomes and their relationship to depression, inflammation markers, and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolites. Bioinformatics, computational modeling, and cell culture models will be used to build and test models that predict depression status and relevant pathways. This approach may define novel relationships between circulating exosome cargo and neuroimmune mechanisms of depression in HIV infection, potentially suggesting new therapeutic targets based on the biology of exosomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to understand neuroimmune mechanisms in the biology of depression in HIV infection through analysis of blood and CSF exosomes and their relationship to depressive symptoms, inflammation, and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism in longitudinal cohorts.

"Machine learning to distinguish HAND from Alzheimer's disease in HIV over age 60 The CDC estimated that one-quarter of Americans living with HIV were over the age of 55 in 2012. By next year, they will be over age 60, entering into the age demographic where Alzheimer's disease (AD) becomes a distinct differential for clinicians. Because up to one-half of people living with HIV experience cognitive impairment from HIV or related factors along, the likelihood for delayed diagnosis of early AD is substantial. Differentiating HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) from the Mild Cognitive Impairment stage of AD (MCI-AD) is one of the most pressing issues in geriatric neuroHIV. Current HAND nosology does not provide guidance on this issue. Published work suggests the likelihood for distinct phenotypes that would facilitate diagnostic sorting with commonly available inputs from neuropsychological testing and structural imaging. In this application, we will use a new approach that leverages computational machine learning with inputs from structural imaging, neuropsychological testing, motor examination and affective/behavioral assessments to determine the factors that most accurately discriminate HAND from MCI-AD. Our preliminary examinations using this novel technique demonstrate a likelihood that this approach will provide diagnostic sorting that exceeds 90% accuracy. We will examine tightly characterized phenotypes using HIV tests to exclude HAND and PET amyloid scanning to exclude AD among 75 HIV+/amyloid marker negative participants with HAND to 50 HIV-negative/amyloid+ cases with MCI (MCI-AD group), all age, sex and disease severity matched and all over age 60, the population of interest due to dual risk. Our methodology will iterate the most distinctive aspects of each disease's phenotype to inform sorting and subsequently, guidelines. We will validate the identified inputs that most clearly contribute to the algorithm though clinical correlations and through the ability of the determined clusters (e.g. diagnostic group) to predict the meaningful outcomes of disease progression. The long-term goal of this work is to inform clinical guidelines, thus, the modalities examined are readily available in clinical care. This work will also extend our understanding of neuropathology in older HIV patients and may identify factors that shift paradigms because our novel approach does not rely on a priori assumptions to inform neuropsychological abnormalities and brain structural alterations linked to HAND in older age. In an exploratory aim, we extend this examination of HAND neuropathogenesis with the added examination of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and a monocyte associated inflammatory marker, soluable CD163 (sCD163), two measures tightly linked to HAND in published work among virally suppressed patients in the current era. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will examine how clinicians can determine if older patients with HIV are also suffering from early Alzheimer's disease (AD). With patients now living into age ranges where both diseases become possible, guidance on how to distinguish impairment due to HIV from the early stages of AD is critically needed.",Machine learning to distinguish HAND from Alzheimer's disease in HIV over age 60,9343421,R01MH113406,"['acetylcholineesterase inhibitor ', ' acetylcholineesterase inhibition ', ' Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors ', ' Affective Symptoms ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Amyloid ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive disease ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' monocyte ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Link ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Exclusion ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' Modality ', ' Sorting -

"Synthetic Molecular Sensors to Target Latently Infected Cells for HIV Eradication DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are no methods currently available for the eradication of the latent reservoir in HIV-infected patients. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop a new method based on synthetic molecular sensors that is capable of targeting latently infected cells in HIV-infected patients for destruction. The objective of this particular application is to design constructs known as ""Synthetic Molecular Sensors for HIV Eradication (SMaSHEd)"" and determine their ability to eradicate latently infected cells from HIV-infected patients or from in vitro latency models. The central hypothesis is that the promoter regions from host genes and the binding sites for miRNAs whose expression can discriminate latently infected from uninfected cells can be used as sensors in SMaSHEd constructs to specifically express a suicide gene in latently infected cells. The rationale for the proposed research is that new methods for eradicating the latent reservoir are required that specifically target latently infected cells, and do not directly target the variable HIV provirus, require activation of HIV replication, or rely on the host immune system to eradicate activated cells. Guided by strong preliminary data, our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1 & 2) Identify genes and miRNAs whose expression can discriminate latently infected primary CD4 T cells from uninfected cells, and (3) Determine the ability of SMaSHEd constructs to induce cell death in latently infected primary CD4 T cells. The analyses in Aim 1 & 2 will utilize RNA-Seq and smallRNA-Seq to identify the genes and miRNAs, respectively that are differentially expressed between latently infected and uninfected primary memory CD4 T cells derived from the in vitro model of our collaborator Dr. Vincente Planelles. Our final aim wil utilize procedures well established in the realm of synthetic biology to design SMaSHEd constructs containing the promoters and miRNA binding sites of genes (Aim 1) and miRNAs (Aim 2), respectively, that specifically sense the environment in latently infected cells. The abilty of these constructs to induce the expression of a suicide gene specifically in latently infected primary CD4 T cells will be assessed following transfection or transduction of mixtures of latently infected and uninfected cells from the in vitro primary CD4 T cell latency model of Dr. Planelles and of Dr. O'Doherty, as well as from HIV-infected patients. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in our opinion, because it will utilize the latest advances in synthetic biology and information gained from next generation sequencing platforms (i.e., RNA-Seq and smallRNA-Seq) to develop a novel method for eradicating latently infected cells. This will be significant because it is the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to lea to the development of a new strategy for the eradication of the latent reservoir in HIV-infected patients. Ultimately, SMaSHEd constructs will be developed for use with appropriate vectors (i.e., adeno-associated virus) for the treatment of HIV-infected patients, where, in contrast to gene therapy, they will only require transient expression to induce the destruction of latently infected cells. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research is relevant to public health since it will develop the knowledge necessary for the design and testing of new therapeutic approaches for the eradication of latently infected cells from HIV-infected patients. Such an approach may eventually lead to a cure for HIV. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIAID's mission that pertains to the better understanding and treatment of infectious diseases.",Synthetic Molecular Sensors to Target

"Characterizing proviral populations in brain tissues ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  This study is designed to meet the goals of the RFA-DA-15-018: Developing Technologies and Tools to Monitor HIV Brain Reservoirs and How They May be Altered by Exposure to Substances of Abuse. To meet this challenge in the R21 phase, we propose to develop and validate a combined next generation sequencing (Pacific Biosciences single-molecule, real time (SMRT) sequencing) and bioinformatics platform to accurately measure and characterize HIV DNA populations in brain and lymph node tissues. In particular, this platform will be able to measure and identify proviral populations that are (i) intact and replication competent, (ii) intact but replication incompetent, and (iii) not intact. We will develop and validate the proposed platform based on international standard procedures for diagnostic molecular methods (i.e. CAP and OIE) using brain and lymph node tissues from HIV-infected individuals on optimized antiretroviral therapy for at least 2 years before death. Once developed and validated, we will use this technology in the R33 phase to determine how HIV DNA populates the brains of stimulant users and non-users. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will develop and validate a next generation sequencing and bioinformatics platform that can quantify and sequence full-length HIV provirus in brain tissue to determine if the sampled HIV DNA populations are: (i) intact and replication competent, (ii) intact but replication incompetent, and (iii) not intact. Once optimized, we will determine how stimulant use is associated with how HIV DNA variants populate brain and lymph node tissues. 1",Characterizing proviral populations in brain tissues,9321036,R21DA041007,"['Affect ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cocaine ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Dopamine ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' lymph nodes ', ' lymph gland ', ' Lymph node proper ', ' Lymph Node Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Methods ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Proviruses ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Solid ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Stop Codon ', ' Nonsense Codon ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Lymph Node Tissue ', ' Reaction ', ' brain tissue ', ' Viral ', ' internal control ', ' expression cloning ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Substance of Abuse ', ' substances of abuse ', ' Appearance ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' single molecule ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Techniques ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Technics ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Methods ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Length ', ' International ', ' Interruption ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' open source ', ' public health relevance ', ' cocaine use ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' HIV Genome ', ' methamphetamine use ', ' methamphetamine using ', ' METH using ', ' METH use ', ' viral rebound ', ' virus rebound ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2017,387500,0.24117470434993873
"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster

"Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1 Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health. Project Narrative  This project aims at developing next-generation neutralization fingerprinting algorithms for the analysis of antibody specificities in polyclonal responses against HIV-1.

"Mining real-time social media big data to monitor HIV: Development and Ethical Issues Social “big data” holds information with wide-ranging implications for addressing issues along the HIV care continuum. Social big data refers to information from social media and online platforms on which individuals and communities create, share, and discuss content. One in four people worldwide, or over a billion people, are publically documenting their activities, intentions, moods, opinions, and social interactions on these sites. They are doing so with increasing volume and velocity, including 400 million “tweets” per day on Twitter and 4.75 billion content items shared per day on Facebook. With an increasing number of these platforms supporting access to publicly-available user data, social big data analysis is a promising new approach for attaining organic observations of behavior that can be used to monitor and predict real-world public health problems, such as HIV incidence. New tools such as social data are therefore needed to supplement existing HIV data collection methods.  In preliminary research, our team developed the first approach that identifies psychological and behavioral characteristics from social big data (>550 million tweets) found to be associated with HIV diagnoses. Since groups at the highest risk for HIV (e.g., minority populations) are the fastest growing Twitter users, and because social media users have been found to publicly share personal information, we identified and collected tweets suggesting HIV risk behaviors (e.g., drug use, high-risk sexual behaviors, etc.) and modeled them alongside CDC statistics on HIV diagnoses. We found a significant positive relationship between HIV- related tweets and county-level HIV cases, controlling for socioeconomic status measures and other variables.  The problem is that this approach is not currently scalable for use by HIV researchers and public health organizations. Although public health agencies are interested in mining social data to address HIV, current tools are not accessible to most health scientists, as the tools require advanced computer science expertise. For example, analyzing 500 million tweets a day requires expertise in big data engineering, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. Developing a single platform for mining social data that has been designed and tested by and for HIV researchers could provide a significant impact on HIV prevention, testing, and treatment. We seek to create a single automated platform that collects social media data; identifies, codes, and labels tweets that suggest HIV-related behaviors; and ultimately predicts regional HIV incidence. Because of the potential ethical issues associated with mining people's data, we also seek to interview staff at local and regional HIV organization and participants affected by HIV to gain their perspectives on the ethical issues associated with this approach.

"Feature selection of DNA methylation biosignatures for neuropathy with comorbid drug abuse in the setting of HIV infection Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSPN) remains the most common neurological complication in HIV-infected population. Opiates and cocaine are often misused to manage neuropathic pain. These drugs, in turn, increase the risk of DSPN and exacerbate DSPN severity. The interplay of DSPN and substance use disorder (SUD) is associated with morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Although neurotoxic effects of HIV-1 gp120 and antiretroviral medications contribute to DSPN through dysregulation of pro-inflammation genes, little is known about the mechanisms of DSPN and DSPN with comorbid SUD. A major barrier to advancing our understanding of DSPN is the inaccessibility of nerve tissues in living individuals and the absence of reliable biomarkers to inform the diagnosis of DSPN in the setting of SUD and HIV infection. Our overarching goal is to discover the DNA methylation signatures for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We focus on white blood cells (WBCs) because of their role in orchestrating and effecting immune responses and because they are highly accessible tissues. We hypothesize that DSPN emerges in the context of HIV infection as the result of HIV-1 enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in many cell types, including WBCs. We also hypothesize that DSPN emerges as the result of SUD-enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in WBCs. Thus, DNA methylation in WBCs is associated with DSPN that is influenced by SUD and contributes to HIV outcomes. To test the hypotheses, we will select methylation features in WBCs for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity using a combination of epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and ensemble-based machine learning approaches. Leveraging two well-established independent cohorts, we will first identify methylation sites in WBCs for DSPN and SUD in four groups (DSPN+/SUD+, DSPN+/SUD-, DSPN-/SUD+, DSPN-/SUD-) in 2,000 HIV- infected samples using a 2-stage EWAS followed by a meta-EWAS. We will then select methylation features using machine learning methods and test the sensitivity and specificity to differentiate DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We will apply our in-house developed bioinformatic package, smartFeatureSelection. The selected features will test associations with immune resilience (i.e. CD4+/CD8+) and HIV outcomes (i.e. frailty, mortality). Finally, we will explore the biological functions of the identified methylation sites in postmortem human brain and blood (N = 80) by RNA-seq and correlate methylation-regulated gene expression between WBCs and neural cells. We expect to discover a set of biologically meaningful methylation features as a marker for HIV- infected DSPN and SUD that can predict resilience and outcomes. Employing a rigorous design and a powerful computational approach, this application proposes the first epigenome-based prediction for DSPN, SUD, and their interaction. The identified features can serve as a biomarker for this complex condition and have potential clinical use. The results will enhance the knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms in blood and in brain for HIV-infected DSPN and SUD. Distal sensory polyneuropathy and substance use disorder are common in the HIV-infected population and can impact immune resilience and HIV outcomes. Applying a combination of epigenome-wide association and machine learning approaches, we aim to identify a panel of DNA methylation features in white blood cells for HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy and substance misuse that link to immune resilience, HIV frailty and mortality. The selected features can serve as biomarker for neuropathy and enhance our understanding of the interplay between neuropathy and substance misuse in HIV-infected population.",Feature selection of DNA methylation biosignatures for neuropathy with comorbid drug abuse in the setting of HIV infection,9687814,R01DA047820,"['HIV-I ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Leukocytes ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nerve Tissue ', ' Nervous Tissue ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Veterans ', ' Polyneuropathy ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' frailty ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Neuropathy ', ' neuropathic ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' brain tissue ', ' Performance ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' Genetic Fingerprintings ', ' DNA Typing ', ' DNA Profiling ', ' DNA Fingerprinting ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' immune function ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' CD8B1 gene ', ' LYT3 ', ' CD8B1 ', ' CD8B ', ' CD8 ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Molecular ', ' neuropathic pain ', ' painful neuropathy ', ' epigenomics ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Advanced Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' neurotoxic ', ' biosignature ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' cocaine use ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' epigenome ', ' model building ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' epigenome wide association analysis ', ' EWAS ', ' epigenome-wide association studies ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opiate use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opioid use ', ' medication misuse ', ' drug misuse ', ' substance misuse ', ' Women’s Interagency HIV Study ', ' Aging ', ' Association Learning ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Envelope Protein gp120 ', ' gp120(HIV) ', ' gp120 ENV Glycoprotein ', ' gp120 ', ' HTLV-III gp120 ', ' HIV env Protein gp120 ', ' HIV Envelope Glycoprotein gp120 ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,606847,0.21621024663572
"Characterizing proviral populations in brain tissues ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  This study is designed to meet the goals of the RFA-DA-15-018: Developing Technologies and Tools to Monitor HIV Brain Reservoirs and How They May be Altered by Exposure to Substances of Abuse. To meet this challenge in the R21 phase, we propose to develop and validate a combined next generation sequencing (Pacific Biosciences single-molecule, real time (SMRT) sequencing) and bioinformatics platform to accurately measure and characterize HIV DNA populations in brain and lymph node tissues. In particular, this platform will be able to measure and identify proviral populations that are (i) intact and replication competent, (ii) intact but replication incompetent, and (iii) not intact. We will develop and validate the proposed platform based on international standard procedures for diagnostic molecular methods (i.e. CAP and OIE) using brain and lymph node tissues from HIV-infected individuals on optimized antiretroviral therapy for at least 2 years before death. Once developed and validated, we will use this technology in the R33 phase to determine how HIV DNA populates the brains of stimulant users and non-users. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will develop and validate a next generation sequencing and bioinformatics platform that can quantify and sequence full-length HIV provirus in brain tissue to determine if the sampled HIV DNA populations are: (i) intact and replication competent, (ii) intact but replication incompetent, and (iii) not intact.

"Evaluating predictors of HIV vaccine efficacy: Statistical methods for estimation, testing, and inference PROJECT SUMMARY We do not have a broadly efficacious vaccine against HIV, a virus that causes approximately 2 million new infections each year. Current proof-of-concept studies using broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV aim to understand how prevention varies with genotypic characteristics of the virus. Since performing an exhaustive search over all genotypic characteristics results in low statistical power to detect effects after adjusting for multiple comparisons, researchers typically pre-specify a small number of features to focus on. There is growing interest in using machine learning-based methods to both corroborate prior understanding and suggest new important genotypic characteristics in predicting sensitivity of the HIV virus to bnAbs. While machine learning-based methods have the potential to yield valid predictive models, issues remain in using these methods for estimating importance. The proposed research will address three such issues: developing a model-free variable importance measure, incorporating information from complex sampling designs, and valid statistical inference both when a genotypic feature is truly important and when it is not. First, the main classical tool for evaluating the importance of characteristics is the ANOVA decomposition, which makes strong modeling assumptions. Machine learning-based methods use minimal assumptions; however, these methods do not generally admit valid statistical inference, and the importance estimates are intimately tied to the technique employed. We will employ an approach based on ideas from the theory of semiparametric estimation and inference to develop a model-free measure of variable importance with valid confidence intervals for the true importance. Second, many HIV vaccine trials incorporate a nested case-control study, where additional information is measured on a subset of the trial participants. Estimating importance only using the subset ignores information from the remaining participants, resulting in a loss of efficiency and potentially adding some bias in estimating variable importance. The proposed research will develop methods that properly account for the sampling design. Finally, to determine if a set of features can be excluded from further analyses, we need a procedure for testing if the feature set truly has no importance. Hypothesis testing using machine learning-based methods is challenging, but we will build on recent advances in semiparametric inference to develop valid procedures for hypothesis testing in the context of variable importance. By combining advances in machine learning technology with ideas from semiparametric estimation and inference, we will determine important feature sets in predicting sensitivity of the HIV virus to bnAbs. In addition to yielding a deeper understanding of HIV neutralization, this information will allow researchers to make the best possible use of data from current clinical trials. This, in turn, could lead to either a shorter time to an HIV vaccine or new bnAbs in the research pipeline that are more broadly efficacious or potent. Any of these outcomes will transform preventative care for patients at risk of HIV infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients living with HIV or AIDS usually require a combination of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and supportive care for life. Understanding how features of the HIV genotype explain the susceptibility of the HIV virus to neutralization by broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV could lead to a broadly efficacious vaccine against HIV infection, either by using a combination of bnAbs or by developing more potent or longer lasting bnAbs that target certain important regions of the HIV genotype. These advances have the potential to make a large public health impact by reducing the number of incident HIV infections, thus reducing the use of ART and the need for supportive care.","Evaluating predictors of HIV vaccine efficacy: Statistical methods for estimation, testing, and inference",9619865,F31AI140836,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Analysis of Variance ', ' Variance Analyses ', ' ANOVA ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Nested Case-Control Study ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' HIV vaccine ', ' human immunodeficiency virus vaccine ', ' HIV/AIDS Vaccines ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' exhaustion ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' neutralizing antibody ', ' interest ', ' virus characteristic ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' case control ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' HIV1 vaccine ', ' HIV-1 vaccine ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' vaccine efficacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' HIV prevention trial ', ' vaccine candidate ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' vaccine study ', ' vaccination trial ', ' vaccination study ', ' vaccine trial ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' semiparametric ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2018,42732,0.31820251669224897
"Implementing and Evaluating a Machine Learning Tool for Entity Resolution in Drug Use and Sexual Contact Networks of YMSM Project Summary Efforts to integrate contact network data with molecular surveillance data provide enormous promise for HIV tracking and intervention. However, the lack of tools to facilitate integrated molecular-social surveillance remains a substantial barrier to progress. For example, most contact network data only contains information on the immediate sexual and drug use partners of a single individual. Yet, the same partners can appear across the contact networks of multiple individuals. Therefore, partners must be matched across contact networks - a process called entity resolution (ER) - in order to provide an accurate view of the overall contact network structure. The process of ER currently requires either substantial resources to manually match individuals or considerable technological expertise in programming to more efficiently match individuals using probabilistic models. Accordingly, this project will 1) develop a machine learning algorithm to match individuals across personal contact networks and validate it using a large existing dataset of young men who have sex with men, and 2) create a graphical user interface to implement the algorithm as an add-on package to an existing tool for network data capture and processing (Network Canvas). The results of this project will provide an open- source and freely available tool that can drastically reduce barriers to matching individuals across contact networks, thereby providing researchers and public health officials with unencumbered access to the underlying structure of drug use and sexual networks, and a potent tool for integrating contact network data with molecular surveillance. Project Narrative Developing an accurate picture of the drug use and sexual contact networks of men who have sex with men (MSM) and other high risk populations can revolutionize the way in which HIV spread is tracked and intervened upon by public health practitioners. However, these data are usually limited to personal networks, which only include immediate sex and drug use partners. The current project will employ state-of-the-art methods in machine learning to improve the accuracy of matching individuals across personal network data and will integrate this tool into a user-friendly graphical user interface and data management tool, thereby substantially reducing barriers to studying contact networks and providing a potent tool for HIV surveillance and interventions.",Implementing and Evaluating a Machine Learning Tool for Entity Resolution in Drug Use and Sexual Contact Networks of YMSM,9563322,R21LM012578,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Algorithms ', ' Data Collection ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Logic ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Phylogeny ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Trees ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' computer human interaction ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Intuition ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' disease transmission ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Graph ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' drug structure ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Resolution ', ' Subgroup ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' user-friendly ', ' open source ', ' graphic user interface ', ' Graphical interface ', ' graphical user interface ', ' usability ', ' surveillance data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' ']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2018,173778,0.16988874214899286
"MRI data fusion to investigate effects of drug abuse on HIV neurological complications Project Summary  Despite widespread use of antiretroviral therapy, nearly half of the 1.2 million Americans living with HIV experience neurocognitive impairments (NCI) that negatively impact daily functioning. HIV-associated NCI is estimated to be the most common form of midlife NCI worldwide. Drug abuse, a highly prevalent comorbidity in HIV+ persons, increases the risk of HIV-associated NCI. Unimodal MRI studies have shown that HIV and drug abuse are each linked with a distinct set of structural and functional alterations in the brain, but how they interact is not well understood. Conventional unimodal analyses are limited in their ability to characterize complex neuropsychiatric diseases because each modality provides an incomplete view of the brain. In contrast, we propose to use innovative fusion approaches that exploit the richness of multimodal data to discover covariations across multiple neuroimaging modalities and cognitive measures simultaneously. This proposal capitalizes on existing data from 3 completed NIDA-funded projects on the neurobehavioral effects of HIV and drug abuse. When combined, the dataset will consist of 217 unique cases (108 HIV+ and 109 HIV-) with in-depth substance use histories, multimodal brain images (i.e., structural, diffusion, and resting-state functional MRI), comprehensive neurocognitive batteries, and a wide range of other phenotypic data. The central hypothesis is that HIV-specific co-alterations in gray matter volume and white matter integrity shape neural functioning and in turn NCI, and that cocaine use worsens these alterations due to its long-term effects on neural circuitry. Using complementary multimodal analyses (supervised fusion and connectomics), we aim to: (1) identify neural biomarkers of HIV neurological disease and associated NCI; and (2) test cocaine as a moderator of HIV-specific co-alterations in brain structure and function and associated NCI. In addition, the project will develop new, advanced methods to improve MRI data quality for cross-study harmonization and to optimize the prediction of NCI based on multimodal indices. This amalgamated dataset provides an unprecedented opportunity to test new and clinically important hypotheses about the neural substrates of HIV- associated NCI in the context of drug abuse. The proposal responds directly to the need for research to “characterize brain morphology or function that is aberrant as a consequence of chronic drug use” and “[its role] in the evolving dynamics of HIV/AIDS pathogenesis, treatment, prevention, and service delivery” [PAR- 16-234]. This research also addresses high priority topics for AIDS-designated funding, including investigation of neurological complications [NOT-15-137]. Building upon a sound premise and robust preliminary data, this innovative project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers of neuroHIV that may facilitate diagnosis and treatment monitoring in active drug users and serve as targets for clinical interventions to mitigate the burden caused by HIV-associated NCI. Public Health Relevance  Nearly half of HIV-infected Americans experience neurocognitive impairments that impact daily functioning, and the prevalence is even higher among persons who are addicted to stimulant drugs.

"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster

"Big Data Analysis of HIV Risk and Epidemiology in Sub-Saharan Africa Project Summary/Abstract HIV is the largest single cause of death among adults in Sub-Saharan Africa, responsible for about a third of all deaths among adults. One of the key paradigms to halting HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa relies on identification of infected individuals and populations for delivery of biomedical and behavioral interventions. However, by the end of 2015 less that half of HIV-infected individuals accessed antiretroviral therapy (ART) despite expansion of eligibility and ongoing efforts to diagnose and initiate treatment. A better understanding of the social, behavioral, environmental, and economic contexts that influence HIV risk could improve the effectiveness and efficiency of programs that aim to identify and target HIV-infected populations. In response to the program announcement for “Harnessing Big Data to Halt HIV” (PA-15-273), the overall goal of this proposal is to develop new analytic tools in large-scale data to predict risk of HIV infection and to generate hypotheses about new or under-recognized risk factors in Sub-Saharan Africa. We plan four primary investigations: (1) Extract and harmonize all Sub- Saharan African nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys that include the HIV status of over 600,000 men and women collected in 29 countries, and hundreds to thousands of associated exposure variables; (2) Develop analytic tools based on LASSO and XWAS to predict HIV infection status and generate hypotheses about social, behaviorial, environmental, an economic risk factors; (3) Identify HIV risk in multi-country, large-scale data and synthesize findings across in Sub-Saharan Africa, and (4) develop a bioethics program to identify targets for new interventions and policies in a culturally and ethically sound manner. The project will develop leverage big data and high-throughput analytic methodology in the service of global HIV control. The outputs of this project include (1) accessible software code for efficient exploration of robust correlates of HIV status derived from the biggest collection of high-dimensional, harmonized, and nationally representative representative household surveys in the world, (2) an extensive landscape of the social, environmental, behavioral, and economic factors predictive of HIV infection among over 600K people tested for HIV in 29 Sub- Saharan countries, and (3) a ethical framework to enable practical, relevant, and appropriate translation and communication of findings. New models of HIV infection will facilitate identification of at-risk groups and the development of interventions to halt the HIV epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa. Project Narrative Advancing the the public health goals for global HIV, including the “AIDS-Free Generation” and “90-90- 90,” requires effective identification of HIV-infected individuals. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop new analytic tools to (1) predict HIV status using modern tools of statistical machine learning and (2) uncover new and under-recognized risk factors for HIV infection in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using person-level data including the HIV status of over 600,000 men and women collected in nationally representative household surveys from 29 countries, we propose to build a high-throughput statistical predictor of HIV status and apply a novel “X-wide association study” (XWAS) to search for and validate social, behavioral, environmental, and economic factors associated with HIV seropositivity. Through development of an ethical/decision making framework and with close consult of an advisory committee, the findings will be used to develop both broad and specific insights about risk factors and at-risk populations for improving HIV care and epidemiology.",Big Data Analysis of HIV Risk and Epidemiology in Sub-Saharan Africa,9460355,R01AI127250,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Analyses ', ' Demographic Analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Household ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Persons ', ' Program Efficiency ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' sound ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Privacy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Demographic and Health Surveys ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Country ', ' Consult ', ' Services ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Bioethics Consultants ', ' Bioethicist ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' behavioral economics ', ' high dimensionality ', ' testing services ', ' treatment services ', ' ']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,666329,0.35691819003825265
"Tough Talks: A Disclosure Intervention for HIV+ YMSM PROJECT SUMMARY Men who have sex with men (MSM) account for nearly two-thirds all of new HIV infections in the United States (US) and young MSM (YMSM) are the only risk group experiencing a significant increase in HIV incidence. Among youth, 67 percent report not disclosing to their first time sex partners.4 Disclosing of one’s HIV status is important for accessing support which can lead to improved medication adherence and retention in care. Those who disclose are more likely to use condoms with uninfected sex partners5 and mathematical modeling estimates that increased HIV status disclosure to sex partners may reduce transmissions by 40-60%.6,7 Further, disclosure may motivate uninfected sex partners to seek testing and reduce their own HIV transmission behaviors. Given the potential benefits and challenges associated with disclosure, there is a need for sophisticated interventions that can assist MSM, with the disclosure process. Virtual reality provides a unique environment for users to practice HIV disclosure. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven disclosure may offer advantages over in-person role play through the use of realistic avatars that represent potential romantic partners, and probabilistic settings where users envision having disclosure conversations. Users have the opportunity to practice disclosing and experience a variety of responses and outcomes. During Phase I of this project we developed an iPad based virtual reality system that features three avatars, two virtual locations and three disclosure scenarios which represent a variety of common disclosure experiences and contexts experienced by YMSM. In Phase II we will further enhance Tough Talks and develop a full-feature automated version to test via a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) through the newly created Center for Innovative Technologies (iTech) across the Prevention and Care Continuum, an NIH-funded center to support adolescent HIV research. The aims of this Phase II SBIR are: 1) Refine and enhance the current Tough Talks disclosure scenarios to include additional content, characters and virtual environments. Formative work with YMSM (aged 16-29 years) will inform development and we will work with a leader in AI software to incorporate natural language into the AI driven scenarios; 2) Develop the Tough Talks stand-alone intervention. This fully automated intervention will include the AI driven disclosure scenarios created in aim 1 as well as a virtual disclosure coach to guide participants through the intervention goal-setting interactive exercises and interactive educational videos. Following development, a technical pilot to optimize functionality and technical performance will be conducted with 8-10 YMSM and; 3) Conduct a three-arm combined efficacy/effectiveness trial to compare the intervention delivered online (Arm 1) versus in the clinic (Arm 2) compared to standard of care (SOC) disclosure messaging only. Primary outcomes of HIV viral load and condomless anal intercourse (CAI) will be assessed at intervention completion (1 month) and at 6-month follow-up. We will estimate transmissions averted and program costs of each arm (Months 19-36). PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite monumental advances in HIV treatment and prevention technologies, disclosing a positive HIV status to an intimate partner remains a daunting and a complex undertaking. However, those who disclose are more likely to use condoms with uninfected sex partners and mathematical modeling estimates that increased HIV status disclosure to sex partners may reduce transmissions by 40-60%. Further, disclosing of one’s HIV status is important for accessing support which can lead to improved retention in care, antiretroviral adherence and decreased viral load.

"Mining real-time social media big data to monitor HIV: Development and Ethical Issues Social “big data” holds information with wide-ranging implications for addressing issues along the HIV care continuum. Social big data refers to information from social media and online platforms on which individuals and communities create, share, and discuss content. One in four people worldwide, or over a billion people, are publically documenting their activities, intentions, moods, opinions, and social interactions on these sites. They are doing so with increasing volume and velocity, including 400 million “tweets” per day on Twitter and 4.75 billion content items shared per day on Facebook. With an increasing number of these platforms supporting access to publicly-available user data, social big data analysis is a promising new approach for attaining organic observations of behavior that can be used to monitor and predict real-world public health problems, such as HIV incidence. New tools such as social data are therefore needed to supplement existing HIV data collection methods.  In preliminary research, our team developed the first approach that identifies psychological and behavioral characteristics from social big data (>550 million tweets) found to be associated with HIV diagnoses. Since groups at the highest risk for HIV (e.g., minority populations) are the fastest growing Twitter users, and because social media users have been found to publicly share personal information, we identified and collected tweets suggesting HIV risk behaviors (e.g., drug use, high-risk sexual behaviors, etc.) and modeled them alongside CDC statistics on HIV diagnoses. We found a significant positive relationship between HIV- related tweets and county-level HIV cases, controlling for socioeconomic status measures and other variables.  The problem is that this approach is not currently scalable for use by HIV researchers and public health organizations. Although public health agencies are interested in mining social data to address HIV, current tools are not accessible to most health scientists, as the tools require advanced computer science expertise. For example, analyzing 500 million tweets a day requires expertise in big data engineering, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. Developing a single platform for mining social data that has been designed and tested by and for HIV researchers could provide a significant impact on HIV prevention, testing, and treatment. We seek to create a single automated platform that collects social media data; identifies, codes, and labels tweets that suggest HIV-related behaviors; and ultimately predicts regional HIV incidence. Because of the potential ethical issues associated with mining people's data, we also seek to interview staff at local and regional HIV organization and participants affected by HIV to gain their perspectives on the ethical issues associated with this approach.

"Identifying Patterns of Cognitive, Motor, and Brain Structural Abnormalities Differentiating Alcohol Use Disorder with and without HIV Infection Comorbidity SUMMARY Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) occurs in the largest segment of individuals in the U.S. who are dependent on a substance. The co-occurrence of AUD in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is high, occurring at twice the rate as occurs in the general population. AUD and HIV infection each are responsible for disruption of brain structural integrity and cognitive and motor impairments, affect some different and some overlapping neural systems, but can also exacerbate the untoward effects on selective systems through synergistic or additive processes. The goal of this research project is to develop novel machine learning methods to differentiate the compounding factors and effects of these two disorders involving brain to improve the mechanistic and dynamic understanding of HIV/AUD comorbidity effects on the brain.  Efficient study of the untoward effects associated with the comorbidity of AUD and HIV on brain morphology requires identifying differences across multiple diagnostic groupings, i.e., healthy controls (CTRL), HIV-negative alcoholics (AUD), HIV-positive without alcohol dependency (HIV), and HIV-positive with alcohol dependency (HIV/AUD). Testing inferences across multiple diagnostic groupings of complex disorders commonly yields inconclusive or conflicting findings when done by conventional, univariate, cross-sectional study designs, which are constructed to model two cohorts at a time and hold ""nuisance"" variables constant with little power to include multiple factors comprising the complexity and dynamism that may well be relevant for distinguishing the primary disorders.  Herein, I propose to develop robust and reliable machine learning technology that can identify patterns from longitudinal MRI data unique to each cohort. This type of data-driven method is able to analyze all data points concurrently and thus provide alternative approaches to conventional methods, which focus on correlating subsets of data guided by expert domain knowledge. I envision that this project will expand my understanding of the neuropsychiatry of AUD and HIV and will also result in extending a mechanistic understanding of neurofactors relevant to HIV/AUD comorbidity. Improving the mechanistic understanding of HIV/AUD comorbidity and diagnostic differences may enhance physician and caregiver awareness and aid clinicians in developing targeted therapeutic options for sustained symptomatic benefits. PROJECT NARRATIVE The co-occurrence of Alcohol Use Disorder and HIV infection is twice as high as in the general population.

"Identification of Biomarkers of CNS injury and resilience related to HIV-1 and Methamphetamine PROJECT SUMMARY Methamphetamine (METH) is commonly abused and is a risk factor for HIV. METH also increases risk for adverse outcomes during HIV, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Multiple studies have demonstrated the neurotoxic effects of METH and HIV on brain structure and function, as well as neurobehavioral and functional performance. Biomarkers of central nervous system (CNS) injury and resilience would be valuable tools for understanding the METH- and HIV-associated pathogenesis and could provide valuable insights for drug development. The effects of METH and HIV outside the CNS (e.g., vascular and metabolic disease) are also important to consider and are a key gap in the field. Another key gap in the field is the translation of research findings to the clinic, including biomarkers that may be used to detect METH- and HIV-associated CNS injury and functional impairment across disease stages. Even less is known about biomarkers of resilience of the host defense mechanisms. Thus, in response to RFA-DA-18-023, this project proposes to screen a comprehensive panel of clinical and research biomarkers reflective of pathology and resilience with the goal of identifying and validating biosignatures that may improve the clinical assessment and diagnosis of brain and peripheral complications associated with METH and HIV. To accomplish this, we propose to leverage NIDA’s prior investment in UCSD’s NIDA-funded Translational Methamphetamine AIDS Research Center (TMARC), which performed standardized neurobehavioral, neuroimaging, and neuromedical assessments of participants who differed by METH use and HIV infection. We will recall and comprehensively re-assess 200 of these participants. Neuroimaging methods will include measures of cerebral blood flow, CNS metabolite levels, and a novel neuroimaging measure to estimate integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We will measure a comprehensive biomarker panel in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and stool samples, in specimens from their prior baseline visit, which are stored, and from their new visit and then analyze the data using traditional statistical approaches as well as novel techniques rooted in machine-learning and causal inference modeling. This approach will provide unique longitudinal data that will allow for the identification of biosignatures that predict changes in CNS injury and resilience. We will validate the observed biosignatures in an independent cohort of 100 participants who have been previously assessed at UCSD’s HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program and who have comprehensive data and stored specimens (e.g., CSF) available. To better respond to the clinical translation objective of the RFA, we will also compare measured biomarkers to data that are obtained during routine clinic assessments with the goal of identifying a clinical biosignature of METH- and HIV-related CNS injury. A thorough understanding of the impact of METH and HIV on systemic and CNS processes will address key gaps in the field. This insight should also inform the development of assays to inform diagnosis and effective disease and treatment monitoring.

"She's PrEPared: The Impact of Intimate Partner Violence on Women's Engagement in the PrEP Care Continuum Project Summary/Abstract A significant relationship exists between intimate partner violence (IPV) and HIV. IPV-exposed women are almost 10 times more likely to report an HIV infection. Extant research indicates multiple direct (e.g., forced sex with risky partner) and indirect (e.g., poor mental health) pathways linking IPV experiences to HIV risk. Developing ways to prevent HIV among IPV-exposed women that is not partner-dependent is needed. Pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), is a daily oral medication and may be the most viable and novel HIV prevention option for IPV-exposed women. However, engaging in PrEP care can be hard including multiple steps (e.g., daily adherence, quarterly medical visits). Women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum may be disrupted by four HIV-related risk factors (economic instability, sexual autonomy, substance abuse, depressive symptoms). First, economic instability can make women dependent on their abusive partner for money and insurance, which may hinder PrEP uptake and adherence. Second, women with low sexual autonomy (e.g., freedom to express one's sexual self) may feel unable or uncomfortable using PrEP if her partner disagree with her wish to use PrEP, which can prevent PrEP uptake. Lastly, substance abuse and feelings of depression can disrupt cognition, making it difficult to engage in daily functions, which may prevent PrEP adherence. To date, there is a dearth of studies examining the implications of IPV on women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum, despite the potential barriers associated with IPV. This is concerning since the Trans-NIH HIV- Related Research Priorities called for research addressing how violence influences experiences along the HIV prevention continuum. This F31 aims to improve the sexual health of women across these research aims: (1a) Examine the effects of IPV on women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum (i.e., interest, uptake, adherence, follow-up visits), and HIV-related risk factors using data from a cohort study of women (n=250); (1b) Explore four HIV-related risk factors as mediators linking IPV and the PrEP care continuum; and (2) Describe women's experiences and processes along the PrEP care continuum (n=32). The proposed research addresses a critical need to understand the relationship between IPV and women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum in order to implement PrEP care in a safe and effective way. This research will devise PrEP engagement strategies, inform intervention development, and help the fight against HIV/AIDS for women. During this 2-year research and training fellowship, the applicant will develop interdisciplinary social science skills including advancing statistical analysis skills, gaining experience in mixed-methods study design and qualitative data analysis, while refining academic and scientific communication. This comprehensive training program will prepare the applicant for a career as an independent violence epidemiologist and academic mentor conducting empirical IPV research while designing HIV prevention interventions with for women. Project Narrative Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be a viable option for IPV-exposed women, but the impact of IPV on women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum is unclear. This study seeks to use mixed methods to understand if and how IPV impacts women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum.",She's PrEPared: The Impact of Intimate Partner Violence on Women's Engagement in the PrEP Care Continuum,9548907,F31MH113508,"['Affect ', ' Cognition ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communication ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Fellowship ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Future ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Forcible intercourse ', ' forced sex ', ' Rape ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Federal Aids ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Oral ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Safe Sex ', ' safer sexual behavior ', ' safer sex ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Protected Sex ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' fight against ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' daily functioning ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' exposure to violence ', ' violence exposure ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,22154,0.11015008550834689
"Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1 Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health.

"Synthetic Molecular Sensors to Target Latently Infected Cells for HIV Eradication DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are no methods currently available for the eradication of the latent reservoir in HIV-infected patients. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop a new method based on synthetic molecular sensors that is capable of targeting latently infected cells in HIV-infected patients for destruction. The objective of this particular application is to design constructs known as ""Synthetic Molecular Sensors for HIV Eradication (SMaSHEd)"" and determine their ability to eradicate latently infected cells from HIV-infected patients or from in vitro latency models. The central hypothesis is that the promoter regions from host genes and the binding sites for miRNAs whose expression can discriminate latently infected from uninfected cells can be used as sensors in SMaSHEd constructs to specifically express a suicide gene in latently infected cells. The rationale for the proposed research is that new methods for eradicating the latent reservoir are required that specifically target latently infected cells, and do not directly target the variable HIV provirus, require activation of HIV replication, or rely on the host immune system to eradicate activated cells. Guided by strong preliminary data, our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: (1 & 2) Identify genes and miRNAs whose expression can discriminate latently infected primary CD4 T cells from uninfected cells, and (3) Determine the ability of SMaSHEd constructs to induce cell death in latently infected primary CD4 T cells. The analyses in Aim 1 & 2 will utilize RNA-Seq and smallRNA-Seq to identify the genes and miRNAs, respectively that are differentially expressed between latently infected and uninfected primary memory CD4 T cells derived from the in vitro model of our collaborator Dr. Vincente Planelles. Our final aim wil utilize procedures well established in the realm of synthetic biology to design SMaSHEd constructs containing the promoters and miRNA binding sites of genes (Aim 1) and miRNAs (Aim 2), respectively, that specifically sense the environment in latently infected cells. The abilty of these constructs to induce the expression of a suicide gene specifically in latently infected primary CD4 T cells will be assessed following transfection or transduction of mixtures of latently infected and uninfected cells from the in vitro primary CD4 T cell latency model of Dr. Planelles and of Dr. O'Doherty, as well as from HIV-infected patients. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in our opinion, because it will utilize the latest advances in synthetic biology and information gained from next generation sequencing platforms (i.e., RNA-Seq and smallRNA-Seq) to develop a novel method for eradicating latently infected cells. This will be significant because it is the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to lea to the development of a new strategy for the eradication of the latent reservoir in HIV-infected patients. Ultimately, SMaSHEd constructs will be developed for use with appropriate vectors (i.e., adeno-associated virus) for the treatment of HIV-infected patients, where, in contrast to gene therapy, they will only require transient expression to induce the destruction of latently infected cells. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research is relevant to public health since it will develop the knowledge necessary for the design and testing of new therapeutic approaches for the eradication of latently infected cells from HIV-infected patients. Such an approach may eventually lead to a cure for HIV. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIAID's mission that pertains to the better understanding and treatment of infectious diseases.",Synthetic Molecular Sensors to Target Latently Infected Cells for HIV Eradication,9731244,R33AI104282,"['Dependovirus ', ' adeno associated virus group ', ' Dependoparvovirus ', ' Adeno-Associated Viruses ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cell Death ', ' necrocytosis ', ' Cell Line ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' endonuclease ', ' Environment ', ' gene therapy ', ' genetic therapy ', ' gene-based therapy ', ' Genetic Intervention ', ' Gene Transfer Clinical ', ' DNA Therapy ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Hela Cells ', ' HeLa ', ' Histones ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' In Vitro ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Patients ', ' Promoter Regions ', ' genetic promoter element ', ' Promotor Regions ', ' Proteins ', ' Proviruses ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 helper T cell ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Transfection ', ' Virus Activation ', ' viral induction ', ' viral activation ', ' Virus Induction ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Programmed Cell Death ', ' Apoptosis Pathway ', ' Apoptosis ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Procedures ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Viral Latency ', ' Virus Latency ', ' Individual ', ' Letters ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', "" 3' Untranslated Regions "", "" 3'UTR "", ' novel ', ' design and construction ', ' design and construct ', ' Modeling ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' CASP3 gene ', ' cysteine protease P32 ', ' caspase-3 ', ' Yama protein ', ' Yama ', ' SREBP Cleavage Activity 1 Gene ', ' SREBP Cleavage Activity 1 ', ' SCA-1 Gene ', ' SCA-1 ', ' PARP Cleavage Protease Gene ', ' PARP Cleavage Protease ', ' Cysteine Protease CPP32 Gene ', ' Cysteine Protease CPP32 ', ' CPP32beta ', ' CPP32B ', ' CPP32 protein ', ' CPP32 ', ' CPP-32 ', ' CASP3 ', ' CASP-3 ', ' Apoptosis-Related Cysteine Protease Caspase 3 ', ' Apopain ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' NIAID ', ' in vitro Model ', ' General Infectious Diseases / Treatment ', ' infectious disease treatment ', ' Molecular ', ' Derivation ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' vector ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' suicide gene ', ' memory CD4 T cell ', ' memory CD4 T lymphocyte ', ' Homing ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' adeno-associated virus vector ', ' AAV vector ', ' adeno-associated viral vector ', ' synthetic biology ', ' public health relevance ', ' novel therapy approach ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapy approaches ', ' new therapeutic strategies ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' differential expression ', ' sequencing platform ', ' Virus reservoir ', ' Viral reservoir ', ' ']",NIAID,VETERANS MEDICAL RESEARCH FDN/SAN DIEGO,R33,2018,524541,0.16953573031392224
"DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several efficacy trials of pre-exposure prophylaxis (daily antiretroviral therapy to prevent HIV acquisition in uninfected persons with sexual exposures) have failed because of poor adherence to medications. To ensure accurate, longitudinal measurement of pill ingestion with real-time monitoring, we plan to develop DOT Diary (D2), a smartphone application that uses artificial intelligence for measuring pill taking using Directly Observed Therapy. This patented technology will be combined with a daily sexual diary for use in future PrEP observational and efficacy trials. Such an approach provides aggregated data for individual participants, study sites, and trials overall, that facilitates realtime feedback to maximize adherence. We plan a 3 stage process for building and evaluating D2. First, we will assess the assess the reliability and validity of the automated DOT tool to identify attempts to ""cheat"" and over-report pill taking, as well as to evaluate the sensitivity of the measure to detecting 1- to 3-week interruptions in pill use. Second, we will develop and optimize the feasibility and acceptability of D2 for participants and study staff in tracking participation ver time, and providing real-time adherence feedback to study participants. Lastly, we will run a 24-week pilot study of D2 for high-risk men who have sex with men to evaluate the plausibility that this tool can be successfully used to measure and optimize adherence in future PrEP trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many studies of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP (giving an anti-HIV medication to an HIV uninfected person to prevent infection from their HIV positive sex partner) have failed to tell us whether or not the medication prevents infection, because very few of the study volunteers took the pills regularly. We will be developing and testing a new technology called DOT Diary (D2) that will be used by PrEP study volunteers to take pictures (using their smartphones) of themselves taking their pills, and also using their phones to keep track of their sexual practices. This will allow future studies to provide extra support for study volunteers not taking their medicines regularly, and to figure out whether or not the medications prevent new HIV infections.",DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence,9542909,R01MH109320,"['Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Color ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Collection ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Feedback ', ' Fumarates ', ' Future ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Incidence ', ' Medicine ', ' Persons ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patents ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Recommendation ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' San Francisco ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' tuberculosis infection ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' TB infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M.tb infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tb infection ', ' M tuberculosis infection ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Injectable ', ' Schedule ', ' Custom ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Ingestion ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Measurement ', ' Spottings ', ' tool ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Frequencies ', ' Oral ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Infection prevention ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Performance ', ' forgetting ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Participant ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Reporting ', ' Directly Observed Therapy ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' emtricitabine ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' pill ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' efficacy trial ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' volunteer ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment adherence ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' Regimen ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' young man ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' dashboard ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' iPhone Application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iOS application ', ' iOS app ', ' Smartphone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Android Application ', ' Android App ', ' smartphone Application ', ' real time monitoring ', ' facial recognition software ', ' ']",NIMH,PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES,R01,2018,760876,0.19280020405405207
"The Interdependency of Drug Resistance Evolution and Drug Design: HIV-1 Protease DESCRIPTION: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies. The pressures of evolution will likely result in a variety of pathways for resistance to evolve. Drug resistance can be caused by a change in the balance of molecular recognition events that selectively weakens inhibitor binding but maintains the biological function of the therapeutic target. To reduce the likelihood of drug resistance, the interdependency of the target's function within the context of the biological system in which it exists must be elucidated. Disrupting the therapeutic target's activity is necessary but not sufficient for avoiding resistance. In this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that key pathways and coupled mechanisms confer drug resistance to therapeutic targets. We seek to define the sequence, structural and dynamic, and temporal evolutionary constraints of the interdependency of drug resistance: 1) to recognize the pathways by which resistance occurs and 2) to devise drug design strategies for developing a drug that is robust against resistance. HIV-1 Protease is the perfect case study! HIV evolves very quickly with on average a point mutation introduced in every third genome replicated. HIV protease inhibitors have the potential of being both very potent and robust to resistance. Protease inhibitors are the only HIV inhibitor class that are transition state analogs and can be evolutionarily constrained within the substrate envelope. Inhibitors that leverage both of these characteristics, such as Darunavir (DRV) and similar analogs, have the potential of being robust, nearly resistance proof inhibitors, to drug- naïve HIV infected patients. If HIV achieves resistance to these inhibitors it is only through complex pathways and combinations of mutations. Further elucidating these complex pathways will bring us closer to resistance-proof inhibitors. In this project our team will use and develop cutting-edge technology to follow the pathways of drug resistance selection, to elucidate the molecular basis for their interdependent patterns and incorporate these mechanisms into drug design strategies. Together we will make inroads into tackling drug resistance that would be impossible for any of us to individually achieve PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging most of our therapeutic strategies.

"Machine learning-based profiles of atherosclerosis to predict disease outcomes in older HIV-infected women and men 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent applications of machine learning methods to epidemiologic data have led to discoveries of novel disease profiles with implications for clinical treatment and practice, including novel phenotypes of heart failure. Machine learning is attractive for large data sets because its algorithms can incorporate many more variables than standard regression methods, take into account temporality and other types of multidimensionality, and easily incorporate non-linearity and multiple interactions. Atherosclerosis is an ideal condition in which to apply machine learning methods, because its pathogenesis is known to be multifactorial, but precise causes are still not fully understood. In the context of HIV infection, its pathogenesis is further complicated by multiple comorbidities, potential adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and HIV itself, mediated by immune activation and inflammation even in the context of long-term suppressive ART. We plan to apply the innovation of machine learning to discover new phenotypes of HIV-associated atherosclerosis that may reflect distinct pathways and affect clinical outcomes. Our Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) and Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) cohorts are two of the most well-established epidemiologic studies of HIV infection in existence. Each cohort has conducted serial imaging of atherosclerosis since 2002 in over 3,000 participants, and across 20-30 years of follow-up, cohort members have each contributed thousands of demographic, clinical, and laboratory data points. Most cohort members are now 50-59 years of age, while substantial numbers are in their sixth or seventh decade of life, allowing us to examine disease features and risk factors across the age spectrum. We propose to use machine learning methods to develop novel phenotypes of atherosclerosis among HIV-infected WIHS women and MACS men (Aim 1), and then determine the utility of these phenotypes by assessing their associations with cardiovascular disease mortality and other age-related clinical and functional outcomes, including traditional “geriatric” outcomes (Aims 2-3). Individuals with HIV infection have evidence of accelerated aging; prior studies have typically evaluated isolated outcomes despite the fact that aging is inherently a multifactorial and complex process. By using machine learning methods to identify novel phenotypes of atherosclerosis that may require different preventive or treatment interventions, this project has the potential to lead to new insights into the role of aging in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis among HIV-infected adults. 8.

"Role of cannabis on HIV-related cognitive impairment:  a brain connectomics study Project Summary  Despite widespread use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), nearly half of HIV+ Americans will experience HIV-related neurological comorbidities that negatively impact daily functioning and clinical outcomes. Alterations in brain structure and function are consistently linked to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), but the mechanisms through which HIV causes alterations in neural networks and associated cognitive function are not well characterized. Marijuana use, which is disproportionately prevalent among HIV+ persons, may increase the risk of HAND. Our preliminary work suggests that co-occurring marijuana use and HIV infection intensifies dysfunction in major neural networks, including white matter abnormalities and decoupling of functional activation patterns. Capitalizing on a strong foundation of neurobehavioral research on drug addiction and HIV/AIDS by our multidisciplinary team, the proposed research will apply connectomic analyses to achieve the following aims: (1) examine the independent and interactive effects of HIV and marijuana on structural and functional organization of the brain; (2) investigate the longitudinal relationship between network-level disruptions in brain organization and cognitive impairment; and (3) use machine deep learning algorithms to develop individualized prediction models for HAND diagnosis and severity based on multimodal graph features. Using a cross-lagged panel design, 200 adults stratified by HIV and marijuana status (4 groups) will have multimodal MRIs and cognitive testing at baseline and 1 year later. The central hypothesis is that marijuana use will exacerbate structural and functional disruptions in brain organization that underlie the expression and progression of HAND. Our proposal responds directly to RFA-18- 610, which highlights the need for studies on “the underlying mechanisms whereby drugs of abuse and HIV infection interact to impair CNS functions mediated through altered neuronal networks.” This research uses a team science approach to address high priority topics for AIDS-designated funding, including neurological complications [NOT-15-137]. Building upon a sound premise and robust preliminary data, this innovative project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers that may aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of HAND in persons with chronic substance use disorders and serve as targets for novel clinical interventions. In addition, our classification models are expected to provide a generalizable framework applicable to individual patients for tailoring of treatment approaches. Public Health Relevance  Of the 1.1 million Americans living with HIV/AIDS, nearly half will experience HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders that impact daily functioning. Marijuana, the mostly commonly abused drug among HIV-infected persons, may accelerate the development and progression of neurocognitive impairments. This study applies a connectomics approach to examine how HIV and marijuana interact to disrupt neural networks that underlie cognitive functioning, with implications for the development of improved diagnostics and treatments.",Role of cannabis on HIV-related cognitive impairment:  a brain connectomics study,9621881,R01DA047149,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic

"Machine learning to distinguish HAND from Alzheimer's disease in HIV over age 60 The CDC estimated that one-quarter of Americans living with HIV were over the age of 55 in 2012. By next year, they will be over age 60, entering into the age demographic where Alzheimer's disease (AD) becomes a distinct differential for clinicians. Because up to one-half of people living with HIV experience cognitive impairment from HIV or related factors along, the likelihood for delayed diagnosis of early AD is substantial. Differentiating HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) from the Mild Cognitive Impairment stage of AD (MCI-AD) is one of the most pressing issues in geriatric neuroHIV. Current HAND nosology does not provide guidance on this issue. Published work suggests the likelihood for distinct phenotypes that would facilitate diagnostic sorting with commonly available inputs from neuropsychological testing and structural imaging. In this application, we will use a new approach that leverages computational machine learning with inputs from structural imaging, neuropsychological testing, motor examination and affective/behavioral assessments to determine the factors that most accurately discriminate HAND from MCI-AD. Our preliminary examinations using this novel technique demonstrate a likelihood that this approach will provide diagnostic sorting that exceeds 90% accuracy. We will examine tightly characterized phenotypes using HIV tests to exclude HAND and PET amyloid scanning to exclude AD among 75 HIV+/amyloid marker negative participants with HAND to 50 HIV-negative/amyloid+ cases with MCI (MCI-AD group), all age, sex and disease severity matched and all over age 60, the population of interest due to dual risk. Our methodology will iterate the most distinctive aspects of each disease's phenotype to inform sorting and subsequently, guidelines. We will validate the identified inputs that most clearly contribute to the algorithm though clinical correlations and through the ability of the determined clusters (e.g. diagnostic group) to predict the meaningful outcomes of disease progression. The long-term goal of this work is to inform clinical guidelines, thus, the modalities examined are readily available in clinical care. This work will also extend our understanding of neuropathology in older HIV patients and may identify factors that shift paradigms because our novel approach does not rely on a priori assumptions to inform neuropsychological abnormalities and brain structural alterations linked to HAND in older age. In an exploratory aim, we extend this examination of HAND neuropathogenesis with the added examination of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and a monocyte associated inflammatory marker, soluable CD163 (sCD163), two measures tightly linked to HAND in published work among virally suppressed patients in the current era. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will examine how clinicians can determine if older patients with HIV are also suffering from early Alzheimer's disease (AD). With patients now living into age ranges where both diseases become possible, guidance on how to distinguish impairment due to HIV from the early stages of AD is critically needed.",Machine learning to distinguish HAND from Alzheimer's disease in HIV over age 60,9475306,R01MH113406,"['Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors ', ' acetylcholineesterase inhibitor ', ' acetylcholineesterase inhibition ', ' Affective Symptoms ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive disease ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' monocyte ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' computational neuroscience ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Link ', ' cortical atrophy ', ' brain atrophy ', ' cerebral atrophy ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scanning ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Exclusion ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' Modality ', ' Sorting -

"Big Data analytics of HIV treatment gaps in South Carolina: Identification and prediction Project Summary/Abstract. Early HIV diagnosis as well as linkage into and retention in HIV medical care for HIV+ individuals is important for patient survival and treatment. Missed opportunities for early HIV diagnosis continues even with recommended routine HIV testing. National and South Carolina (SC) estimates of retention in HIV medical care are slightly above fifty percent, indicating a gap in HIV treatment. With significant proportions of HIV+ individuals not receiving HIV medical care, improved outcomes of care and HIV prevention as part of national HIV/AIDs strategies are difficult to achieve. The purpose of this study is to use novel machine learning algorithms to further explore, identify, characterize, and explain predictors of missed opportunities for HIV medical care utilization among all living HIV+ individuals in SC. Profiles of HIV+ individuals based on their patterns of HIV medical care seeking behavior will be developed with concomitant identification of both gaps in HIV care and missed opportunities for reengagement into HIV care. Health utilization behavior for HIV+ individuals' pre-HIV diagnosis also will be studied to identify where missed opportunities for HIV testing occurs. Findings will be integrated with the ongoing effort of the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC)'s Data-to-Care (DTC) program as well as the Ryan White Care Program. The public health value that HIV treatment brings includes improved survival outcomes of care among HIV+ individuals as well as reduced HIV transmission. These important components form part of the overall strategy for fighting and controlling the HIV epidemic in the United States and aligns closely with the strategic goals of reducing new HIV infections. Using state-level CD4 and Viral Load (VL) testing data available for all SC HIV+ individuals since 2004, the study will link inpatient and outpatient claims data sources, the state electronic HIV/AIDS reporting system, Area Health Resource Files, and data from the state corrections database to create a unique population based dataset spanning 10 years (2004-2013). Advanced Big Data analytical algorithms will be used to create person-level profile patterns of pre- and post- HIV diagnosis health utilization behaviors and for identifying best predictors of linkage and retention in HIV medical care. These algorithms will be useful in unearthing hidden features/predictors of HIV medical care utilization. A predictive model useful for predicting where HIV+ individuals who are not in care will access routine medical care (missed opportunities) also will be developed. Findings will provide fresh guidance for public health interventions targeting early HIV testing and linkage to and retention in HIV medical care for SC HIV-infected individuals. Project Narrative. Treatment as a public health strategy of HIV prevention is important in fighting the national HIV epidemic. Early diagnosis, linkage to, and retention in HIV medical care are key public health strategies for HIV prevention. Missed opportunities for HIV diagnosis as well as inadequate HIV medical care utilization by HIV+ individuals in South Carolina negatively impacts HIV survival outcomes, while increasing population transmission risks. The analyses of population-based health utilization data for HIV+ individuals using powerful machine learning techniques such as deep learning algorithms will generate new factors useful for improving retention in HIV care. This valuable new information will be translated into ongoing efforts such as SC's Data-to Care and Ryan White care efforts through improved targeting of HIV medical care engagement and reengagement interventions.",Big Data analytics of HIV treatment gaps in South Carolina: Identification and prediction,9512753,R01AI127203,"['Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Awareness ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Dropout ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Resources ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Persons ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' South Carolina ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' fighting ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' care seeking ', ' intervention program ', ' novel ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Drops ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Predictive Value ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' surveillance data ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' public health intervention ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Scientist ', ' Data Science ', ' Data Analytics ', ' improved outcome ', ' survival outcome ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' deep learning ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2018,633579,0.40224731787593315
"High-throughput Deep Sequencing Assay to Reliably Measure the HIV Reservoir during Antiretroviral Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study is designed to meet the goals of the RFA ""Innovative assays to quantify the latent HIV reservoir"" that can ""facilitate proof-of-concept studies for curing HIV infection."" To meet this challenge we propose to develop and validate a combined next generation sequencing (Pacific Biosciences single-molecule, real time (SMRT) sequencing) and bioinformatics platform to accurately measure replication-competent provirus (i.e. Proviral Phenotypic Predictor; P3). An over-arching objective would be for the assay to have a ""higher throughput, faster turnaround, lower cost, and greater reproducibility"" than the current standard quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA). We will develop and validate the proposed P3 platform based on international standard procedures for diagnostic molecular methods (i.e. CAP and OIE) using latently infected cells from HIV-infected individuals on optimized antiretroviral therapy for at least 2 years. These participants will be well-characterize to estimated duration of infection at the start of their therapy, and will represent high, medium and low levels of HIV DNA levels. Such characterizations will be necessary to adequately address the dynamic range of the proposed P3 platform. Once P3 methods have been optimized, we will rigorously compare P3 and QVOA methods in their ability to characterize the replication competent proviral reservoir and by costs and turnaround time for results. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal is specifically designed to develop and validate a high-throughput next generation sequencing and bioinformatics platform (P3=""Proviral Phenotypic Predictor"") to fully characterize the latent HIV reservoir through quantification and sequencing of Full-length HIV provirus. We will determine the accuracy and exact error rate for our proposed platform, and we will compare this new assay to the standard quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA) to delineate what amount of intact and replication competent HIV genomes is not inducible (and therefore not recognized) by QVOA. Being able to characterize each part of the HIV DNA population, and especially determine what proportion of intact and replication competent HIV DNA is not inducible by standard QVOA, will allow us to better evaluate the impact of any intervention aimed at reducing the HIV latent reservoir. 1",High-throughput Deep Sequencing Assay to Reliably Measure the HIV Reservoir during Antiretroviral Therapy,9405836,R01AI120009,"['Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Methods ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phytohemagglutinins ', ' Phaseolus vulgaris Lectins ', ' Kidney Bean Lectins ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Proviruses ', ' Rest ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 helper T cell ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Stop Codon ', ' Nonsense Codon ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Viral ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' PBMC ', ' expression cloning ', ' Participant ', ' Appearance ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' single molecule ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Techniques ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Technics ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Methods ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effectiveness analyses ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' International ', ' Interruption ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' Allogenic ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' deep sequencing ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' open source ', ' public health relevance ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' HIV Genome ', ' virus rebound ', ' viral rebound ', ' SMRT-seq ', ' SMRT sequencing ', ' single molecule real time sequencing ', ' ']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,751984,0.29035726448441807
"Neuroimmune mechanisms of depression in adults with HIV infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to understand neuroimmune mechanisms of depression in adults with HIV infection through analysis of plasma and CSF exosomes and the relationship of exosome protein cargo to inflammation and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism. Systemic inflammation in HIV infection and other conditions is associated with increased risk of depression through mechanisms involving altered tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism and other unknown mechanisms. Exosomes mediate cell-cell communication during inflammation and other conditions, but their role in neuroimmune interactions involved in depression have not been defined. Preliminary studies showed increased levels of circulating exosomes in HIV patients on ART compared to controls. Moreover, we identified heat shock proteins, Wnt proteins, and other protein cargo in these exosomes that correlate with HIV status, altered tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism, and depressive symptoms. Given that dysregulated Wnt/GSK3-β signaling and inflammatory responses have been linked to depression and other mood disorders, these findings suggest that circulating exosomes may play a role in neuroimmune interactions that impact depression through effects on Wnt/GSK3-β and/or TLR-mediated signaling. To address these questions, we will use clinical samples and data from well characterized HIV+ cohorts followed longitudinally to characterize plasma and CSF exosomes and their relationship to depression, inflammation markers, and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolites. Bioinformatics, computational modeling, and cell culture models will be used to build and test models that predict depression status and relevant pathways. This approach may define novel relationships between circulating exosome cargo and neuroimmune mechanisms of depression in HIV infection, potentially suggesting new therapeutic targets based on the biology of exosomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to understand neuroimmune mechanisms in the biology of depression in HIV infection through analysis of blood and CSF exosomes and their relationship to depressive symptoms, inflammation, and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism in longitudinal cohorts.

"Defining the impact of injection drug use on antiretroviral therapy and HIV treatment outcomes: an (epi)genomic approach Although uptake of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in people who inject drugs (PWID) infected with HIV has increased dramatically in the past decade, poor health outcomes including non-AIDS-related comorbidity and mortality in HIV-infected PWID on cART remains a significant public health problem. A crucial knowledge gap is a lack of the understanding about how injection drug use (IDU) impacts the course of HIV disease. Differences in gene regulation affected by IDU and non-adherence to cART are likely to affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these treatments that may result in poor outcomes. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify genomic signatures for PWID and to link PWID-associated genomic signals to HIV outcomes in the context of cART exposure (i.e., levels in plasma). Our overall hypothesis is that PWID accrue DNA methylation (DNAm) and transcriptome variations that impact on health outcomes, and which may be explained in part by variability in cART exposure. This hypothesis is built on our previous findings showing that IDU significantly altered the blood DNA methylome in HIV-infected individuals. Furthermore, DNAm signatures associated with IDU differentiated less and greater HIV disease frailty. To test this hypothesis, our approach will first perform epigenome-wide DNAm association analysis and transcriptome-wide association analysis in HIV-infected PWID as compared to HIV-infected non-PWID who are treated with cART in two independent cohorts. Second, we will test the relationship between PWID-associated differentially methylated positions (DMP) or regions (DMR) and differential gene expression (DGE) on cART variability in plasma and also their relationships with HIV frailty and mortality. Last, we propose to integrate genetic variation (single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP]), DNAm, and gene expression that differs by HIV-infected PWID/non-PWID status. Our goal is to identify DMP or DMR and DGE between HIV-infected PWID and non-PWID in the context of cART and to apply epigenetic and transcriptomic signatures as biomarkers to predict HIV frailty and mortality. The application proposes the first integrative pharmacogenomic approach of genetic variants, epigenomic and transcriptomic associations for HIV-infected PWID in the context of cART. We expect to identify PWID- associated genes that can predict HIV cART treatment outcomes. The predictive model resulting from this project can inform biomarker identification for HIV outcomes. The proposal is the first step towards the understanding of pharmacogenomics and pharamcoepigenomics in PWID with HIV infection. The results will fill the knowledge gap of the biological basis of IDU effects on HIV outcomes and provide evidence to prioritize genes for future research of their functions in HIV progression. People who inject drug use infected with HIV have high medical comorbidity and poor health outcomes despite the availability of combination anti-retroviral therapy. Our integrative pharmacogenomic approach aims to define a set of genes associated with HIV-infected injection drug use and anti-retroviral therapy that predict HIV outcomes. Our work will generate not only knowledge about how injection drug use perturbs the HIV- infected host epigenome and transcriptome, but also potential biomarkers to predict individual HIV outcomes in the context of combination antiretroviral therapy.",Defining the impact of injection drug use on antiretroviral therapy and HIV treatment outcomes: an (epi)genomic approach,9614604,R01DA047063,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' indexing ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Public Health ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' uptake ', ' gene function ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' frailty ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' persons who inject drugs ', ' people who inject illicit drugs ', ' people who inject drugs ', ' PWID ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' cohort ', ' intravenous drug use ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Pharmacodynamics ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Data ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' therapy prediction ', ' predict treatment response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Gene Combinations ', ' Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression ', ' Differential Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Gene Expression ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' epigenomics ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' transcriptomics ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' nondrug ', ' non-drug ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' injection drug use ', ' methylome ', ' epigenome ', ' genetic approach ', ' genomic strategy ', ' genomic effort ', ' Genomic approach ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' differential expression ', ' BeadChip ', ' bead chip ', ' potential biological marker ', ' potential biomarker ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' transcriptome ', ' epigenome wide association analysis ', ' EWAS ', ' epigenome-wide association studies ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' marker identification ', ' biomarker identification ', ' genomic classifier ', ' genomic signature ', ' Women’s Interagency HIV Study ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,562739,0.34826530267261024

Her mentees will have access to a wealth of research opportunities in the context of the many large HIV-focused clinical trials and studies that Dr. Lockman leads (and led over the past 18 years) in Botswana and elsewhere, ranging from randomized trials of antiretroviral or antibiotic regimens (many in pregnant women and their infants) to observational and epidemiologic studies of clinical outcomes among HIV-infected adults and HIV-exposed children. In the proposed K24, she will leverage the unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a large ongoing randomized HIV combination prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000 with longitudinal cohort of 12,000 adults), in order to mentor investigators from Botswana and the US on pressing questions of substantial public health and clinical relevance to the severe epidemic still affecting sub-Saharan Africa. For context, UNAIDS is promoting high levels (90% or greater) of HIV diagnosis, antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage, and virologic suppression (“90-90-90” targets) to end the HIV epidemic. However, despite nearly meeting these targets in Botswana, we observe annual HIV incidence >1%. Furthermore, with more than 15% of the adult population of Botswana on ART (and recent implementation of universal ART), it is essential that we understand the implications of widespread treatment for clinical outcomes and non-communicable disease incidence in persons living with HIV at the population level. We will therefore: a) Characterize adults with recent HIV infection using predictive analysis, in order to identify groups at highest risk for HIV acquisition in the current epidemic, and augment our understanding with individual in-depth interviews with recently- infected adults; b) Study the feasibility, acceptability, and uptake of a targeted approach to TDF/FTC pre- exposure prophylaxis, offered to HIV-negative persons meeting this high-risk profile; c) Evaluate the impact of HIV (and of early ART) on clinical outcomes, including c ancer incidence and hypertension prevalence in HIV-infected vs. HIV-uninfected adults, and HIV-related outcomes among persons starting dolutegravir- vs. efavirenz-based ART. In addition, Dr. Lockman will also mentor junior investigators on projects nested within a new large randomized IMPAACT trial of 3 antiretroviral regimens in pregnancy that that she leads, and in prior large perinatal HIV studies in Botswana that enrolled more than 9,000 mother-infant pairs. This K24 is critical, to support the protected time and resources that are required for Dr. Lockman to mentor junior investigators from both the US and Botswana in patient-oriented research. NARRATIVE Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in global patient-oriented HIV research (many of whom have gone on to conduct funded research of their own), and is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. In this project, she will harness unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a randomized HIV prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000), in order to study questions of major public health importance in the new reality of universal antiretroviral treatment (regardless of HIV disease stage)--namely, whether it is feasible and acceptable to identify and offer proven HIV prevention interventions to HIV-negative persons at high risk for acquiring HIV; and what the longer-term health implications of HIV (and of universal treatment) are, for the health of HIV-infected and –uninfected people (including hypertension and cancer risk).",Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial,9440337,K24AI131928,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Botswana ', ' Bechuanaland ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Male Circumcision ', ' Circumcision ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemic ', ' Faculty ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' Household ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mentors ', ' Mothers ', ' Persons ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' virology ', ' Measures ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' cancer risk ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' efavirenz ', ' treatment program ', ' Prevention ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' emtricitabine ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' point of care ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' community intervention ', ' Outcome ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' high risk ', ' HIV prevention trial ', ' population based ', ' IMPAACT ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Regimen ', ' Secure ', ' Prevention trial ', ' trial design ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' perinatal HIV ', ' ']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2018,188858,0.380206186955001
"Prediction of heart failure in HIV-infected individuals 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Half of those living with HIV in the U.S. are or will soon be >50 years of age. Heart failure, which has one of the highest disease burdens of any age-related condition nationwide, may soon become the most costly HIV- related comorbidity in terms of premature mortality, suffering, and healthcare expenditures. Many of its known risk factors are common to HIV-infected and uninfected individuals alike, but less is known about its pathogenesis in the context of suppressive HIV therapy. New evidence suggests that long-term survival with HIV is associated with greater risks for systolic and diastolic dysfunction as well as resultant heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Against a background of high diabetes, hypertension, and obesity risk in minority groups affected disproportionately by HIV, a unique set of etiologic and prognostic factors for heart failure in the context of HIV infection likely exists. The proposed research is a set of epidemiologic studies characterizing the role of HIV infection in heart failure incidence and survival, based on data from the largest HIV care provider in the Bronx, NY. Aim 1 will assess the association between HIV infection and heart failure incidence, and Aim 1b will identify risk factors, including major comorbidities, that may lead to greater mortality in optimally treated HIV-infected heart failure patients compared with HIV-uninfected heart failure patients. Aims 2 and 3 will implement machine learning methods within our longitudinal electronic medical record database to construct prediction models identifying HIV+ patients at greatest risk of developing HF, and to identify unique HIV-specific phenotypes of HFpEF and HFrEF. Prediction models developed in our clinical population (90% minority, 40% female) will be validated in a demographically complementary HIV+ cohort in Chicago (50% minority, 15% female) to evaluate the transportability of these models across patient populations. This award will provide ample training opportunities for the candidate to continue his progression to an independent academic research career with specialized experience at the intersection of HIV, cardiovascular disease, and medical informatics. Established institutional resources and a mentoring team with a proven record of success, as well as research conducted within a geographic area with endemic levels of HIV and heart disease, provide an ideal setting to successfully produce high quality research with major impact. The collaboration will establish a program for large-scale translational research in HIV and heart failure by developing a shared research platform between two major research institutions in the Bronx and Chicago. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heart failure imposes one of the highest disease burdens of any condition in the U.S., with over 6 million Americans affected, and costs reaching $34 billion annually. The extent to which it affects people living with HIV is currently unclear but of critical importance, due to the aging of the population as a result of successful antiretroviral therapy. Our work will allow for the prediction of heart failure risk in people living with HIV and identify unique heart failure phenotypes in the context of HIV infection, both of which may help to tailor prevention and treatment efforts in the future in this vulnerable population.",Prediction of heart failure in HIV-infected individuals,9463657,K01HL137557,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', '

"Optimizing outcomes at the intersection of HIV and mental health: Prediction, precision medicine, and population health PROJECT SUMMARY  Psychiatric disorders and substance misuse are prevalent among people with HIV (PWH) and have negative effects on HIV control. These conditions impose substantial emotional and physical burdens, impede the achievement of virologic suppression, and are associated with behaviors that increase the risk of transmission. While it is common for PWH to have multiple psychiatric diagnoses, relatively little is known about the ways in which combinations of psychiatric symptoms and substance misuse behaviors confer elevated risk for poor HIV control, or how to personalize the management of these commonly co-occurring disorders. Furthermore, estimates of the potential public-health impact of mental health service innovations on the HIV epidemic are generally lacking. Recent innovations in statistics and machine learning make it possible to harness complex data to identify patterns of psychiatric disease in PWH and tailor psychiatric therapy to optimize HIV control in ways that classical statistical approaches cannot.  The candidate is a translational and computational investigator and general internal medicine physician at Johns Hopkins University with a background in computer science and biostatistics. During this award period, he will be mentored by a team whose expertise spans HIV care, psychiatric epidemiology, machine learning, population-level HIV modeling, and personalized medicine. The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent, translational researcher who applies innovative statistical and machine learning approaches to improve the health of individuals and populations at the intersection of HIV and mental health.  The overarching objective for this project is to address psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in the context of the HIV continuum of care by developing models that leverage complex data to inform patient care and public policy. Three aims will be undertaken: (1) to identify how combinations of symptoms of depression and anxiety and misuse of alcohol, cocaine, opioids, marijuana, and amphetamines impact individual-level HIV control; (2) to use repeated patient-reported measures of depression, anxiety, and substance misuse to predict future mental health and HIV control under a potential pharmacotherapies; and (3) to develop population models that project the impact of mental health service interventions on HIV incidence and mortality. The models will leverage data from the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS), a racially diverse, multi-site cohort of over 31,000 PWH.  This mentored research will be accompanied by relevant skills training in mental health epidemiology, the care of PWH, and advanced Bayesian and machine-learning methods. Collectively, this research and career development training will provide a clear pathway to an independent career as a clinical investigator focused on optimizing the management of psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in PWH at both the individual and population level. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric comorbidities and substance misuse present major obstacles for many persons with HIV in achieving virologic suppression, with negative consequences for both individual and population health. I propose to address psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in the context of the HIV continuum of care by developing innovative models that leverage complex patient data (1) to guide the care of individual persons with HIV and mental illness and (2) to inform policy decisions about systems-level interventions in mental health. As part of a mentored research training program, this award will allow me to become a leading independent researcher with the expertise to leverage complex individual- and population-level data to optimize the health of individuals and populations with HIV who suffer from mental illness.","Optimizing outcomes at the intersection of HIV and mental health: Prediction, precision medicine, and

"Quantitative diagnosis of TB/HIV co-infection using pathogen-specific exosomes in blood ABSTRACT Patients co-infected with HIV and tuberculosis (TB) exhibit accelerated progression of both diseases. A missed TB diagnosis in a HIV-positive patient, and vice versa, can have severe consequences, since mortality rates are very high in HIV/TB co-infected patients. The World Health Organization thus recommends HIV testing for TB patients and TB screening for HIV-affected patients. Early diagnosis of HIV/TB co-infections and appropriately timed interventions can improve health outcomes by slowing disease progression and reducing mortality and the spread of these infections. Given this urgent need for early diagnosis of HIV and TB, we propose to develop and validate a novel assay that rapidly and directly diagnoses both HIV and TB infections, using a sensitive nanoplasmon-enhanced scattering (nPES) platform to detect pathogen-specific (Ps) exosomes (PsExo) that carry TB- and/or HIV-derived antigens in patient serum samples. Ps antigens are often difficult to detect in circulation, due to low concentrations and potential masking by non-specific protein interactions or degradative enzymes, especially early in infection when antigen concentrations are low. Body fluids are rich in exosomes, and exosomes are rich sources of multiple Ps-antigens. Exosome enrichment effectively concentrates Ps- antigens and protects them from circulating hydrolases, thereby enhancing and improving detection. While use of PsExo as biomarkers for diagnosing specific infectious diseases is new and shows great promise, significant technical challenges, including the current lack of validated PxExo markers for specific diseases and simple and rapid assays for PsExo analysis, exist. We have recently demonstrated that we can use our nPES assay platform to quantify cancer-derived exosomes and diagnose early-stage pancreatic tumors from disease controls. We will adapt this approach to detect HIV and TB PsExo in this proposal. Aim 1 will address the first issue by identifying pathogenic proteins specifically or predominantly expressed on exosomes of infected cells and evaluating PsExo candidates by quantitative proteomics analysis of infected patients from Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) sample bank. Aim 2 will establish an optimized nPES array using Aim 1 PsExo biomarkers, apply machine learning to develop an nPES array that can effectively diagnose HIV, TB and HIV/TB patients based on nPES results, and validate these findings in an independent FIND cohort. This approach does not require a separate exosome isolation step and uses only microsample serum volumes. The proposed assay will benefit co-infected patients who are unable to produce sputum, extrapulmonary TB patients who often require invasive biopsies for diagnosis, and patients with acute HIV infections who are still HIV antibody negative. Project Narrative Tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of HIV-related mortality, accounting for one in three HIV deaths, while HIV infection has contributed to a significant increase in the worldwide incidence of TB. Successful development and validation of PsExo-nPES arrays described in this proposal will improve diagnosis of HIV and TB co-infections in vulnerable and diagnostically challenging populations. This earlier and more accurate HIV and TB diagnosis will permit earlier intervention to prevent disease spread and improve patient outcomes.",Quantitative diagnosis of TB/HIV co-infection using

"Optimizing HIV Treatment Monitoring under Resource Constraints ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With escalating global access to HIV antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, treatment failure is inevitable and must be anticipated. Correct and early diagnosis of treatment failure is essential for cost savings, durable response to therapy and prevention of morbidity and mortality. Most HIV treatment programs in the developing world either do not have access to viral load (VL) testing, the gold-standard treatment monitoring modality, or can apply it only on a limited basis. Other monitoring technologies such as drug resistance testing are even less common for financial and infrastructure constraints. In this proposal we will develop, evaluate and implement methods to optimize monitoring of ARV therapy in resource limited settings (RLS) that have diverse VL availability. Though several recent studies have proposed and evaluated lower-cost markers as VL surrogates and strategies for selective VL use, they generally are not based on a formal, decision theoretic framework that allows discovery of strategies with optimality properties that can be expressed in terms of misclassification rate, cost, and other clinically relevant parameters. We propose to develop the statistical framework, theory and methods required to discover optimal diagnostic algorithms for monitoring treatment failure with limited or no VL availability; to use cohort data from both the US and Kenya to derive, calibrate and cross-validate the algorithms; to use extant plasma samples from patients in a PEPFAR-funded HIV care program to design and cross-validate a new diagnostic algorithm that includes implementation of pooled assays; and to develop usable software that will enable programs to design their own protocols based on the characteristics of their patient population and local capacity for viral load testing.

"Novel, Adaptive Approaches to Predicting and Responding to Outbreaks of Overdose, HIV and HCV Among People Who Use Drugs Project Summary Opioid use disorder (OUD), HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) are co-occurring epidemics—a syndemic—among people who inject drugs (PWID). While effective interventions exist to prevent and treat all three conditions, the United States (US) has seen a 200% surge in overdoses linked to opioids since 2000, and a rise in acute HCV infections since 2010. In addition, an outbreak of HIV in Scott County, Indiana in 2014-2015, led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to list 220 counties in the US as high-risk for HIV and HCV epidemics among PWID. Within the past year, new outbreaks of HIV among PWID have been reported in multiple states across the US, including West Virginia (WV), Ohio (OH), Kentucky (KY) and Massachusetts (MA). The current tools being used to target and manage responses to new outbreaks are inadequate to the task of stemming their spread and impact: syndromic surveillance can identify, but not predict new overdose events; rates of undiagnosed HIV and HCV infection remain high, particularly among young people; and interventions to prevent and treat OUD, HIV and HCV do not reach the vast majority of PWID who need them. I am proposing an innovative, interdisciplinary research program integrating spatial epidemiological methods, spatiotemporal regression models, Bayesian learning techniques, operations research and sequential decision- making methods to address the deficiencies in contemporary approaches to this syndemic among PWID. Leading a team of researchers, public health experts, clinicians and other front-line service providers, I will develop new predictive algorithms to map evolving community risk for overdose; novel adaptive approaches to hotspot detection for HIV and HCV and; algorithms to guide the pre-deployment and micro-targeting of prevention and treatment interventions for all three diseases to reach those most at risk and in need. All of these state-of-the-art methods will be freely available in a suite of web applications to allow practitioners to visualize the local interaction between these three interlocking epidemics. In addition, the web application will allow users to target services for PWID for OUD, HIV and HCV as well as assist decision-makers in optimal responses based on epidemiologic and economic considerations. Preliminary work on these algorithms and a prototype of the web applications are now underway with open-source data on overdose from Cincinnati, OH and data from OH and Connecticut have been obtained to scale-up this work. This project thus represents a groundbreaking effort in which the latest insights from a variety of scientific disciplines will be combined to offer new epidemiological insights into the interactions between OUD, HIV and HCV at the local level and for rapid implementation into the field to ensure timely public health impact on OUD, HIV and HCV among PWID in the US. Project Narrative This project will clarify how three interlocking epidemics—of opioid use disorder, HIV and hepatitis C—play out across cities and towns, across time, and down to the level of census tracts and neighborhoods in the US. Through an interdisciplinary approach combining epidemiology, statistics, operations research and decision science, the project will provide a framework for predicting and quickly responding to each of these epidemics alone and in combination at the local level. The results of the project will be translated into a web application and other support tools to guide decision-makers as they confront and seek to respond more efficiently to the current public health crisis among people who use drugs.","Novel, Adaptive Approaches to Predicting and Responding to Outbreaks of Overdose, HIV and HCV Among People Who Use Drugs",9821365,DP2DA049282,"['Algorithms ', ' Censuses ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Connecticut ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Indiana ', ' Infection ', ' Kentucky ', ' Maps ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Ohio ', ' Operations Research ', ' Overdose ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' West Virginia ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' base ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' tool ', ' Drug user ', ' persons who use drugs ', ' people who use illicit drugs ', ' people who use drugs ', ' PWUD ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' persons who inject drugs ', ' people who inject illicit drugs ', ' people who inject drugs ', ' PWID ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Services ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' syndromic surveillance ', ' Acute Hepatitis C ', ' scale up ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' stem ', ' prototype ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' support tools ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' open data ', ' open-source data ', ' open science ', ' HIV/HCV ', ' HIV/Hepatitis C ', ' HIV-HCV ', ' HIV and hepatitis C ', ' HIV and HCV ', ' HCV/HIV ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opiate crisis ', ' service providers ', ' overdose risk ', ' Bayesian learning ', ' Bayesian machine learning ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,DP2,2019,2512500,0.34948694539212616
"Feature selection of DNA methylation biosignatures for neuropathy with comorbid drug abuse in the setting of HIV infection Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSPN) remains the most common neurological complication in HIV-infected population. Opiates and cocaine are often misused to manage neuropathic pain. These drugs, in turn, increase the risk of DSPN and exacerbate DSPN severity. The interplay of DSPN and substance use disorder (SUD) is associated with morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Although neurotoxic effects of HIV-1 gp120 and antiretroviral medications contribute to DSPN through dysregulation of pro-inflammation genes, little is known about the mechanisms of DSPN and DSPN with comorbid SUD. A major barrier to advancing our understanding of DSPN is the inaccessibility of nerve tissues in living individuals and the absence of reliable biomarkers to inform the diagnosis of DSPN in the setting of SUD and HIV infection. Our overarching goal is to discover the DNA methylation signatures for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We focus on white blood cells (WBCs) because of their role in orchestrating and effecting immune responses and because they are highly accessible tissues. We hypothesize that DSPN emerges in the context of HIV infection as the result of HIV-1 enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in many cell types, including WBCs. We also hypothesize that DSPN emerges as the result of SUD-enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in WBCs. Thus, DNA methylation in WBCs is associated with DSPN that is influenced by SUD and contributes to HIV outcomes. To test the hypotheses, we will select methylation features in WBCs for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity using a combination of epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and ensemble-based machine learning approaches. Leveraging two well-established independent cohorts, we will first identify methylation sites in WBCs for DSPN and SUD in four groups (DSPN+/SUD+, DSPN+/SUD-, DSPN-/SUD+, DSPN-/SUD-) in 2,000 HIV- infected samples using a 2-stage EWAS followed by a meta-EWAS. We will then select methylation features using machine learning methods and test the sensitivity and specificity to differentiate DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We will apply our in-house developed bioinformatic package, smartFeatureSelection. The selected features will test associations with immune resilience (i.e. CD4+/CD8+) and HIV outcomes (i.e. frailty, mortality). Finally, we will explore the biological functions of the identified methylation sites in postmortem human brain and blood (N = 80) by RNA-seq and correlate methylation-regulated gene expression between WBCs and neural cells. We expect to discover a set of biologically meaningful methylation features as a marker for HIV- infected DSPN and SUD that can predict resilience and outcomes. Employing a rigorous design and a powerful computational approach, this application proposes the first epigenome-based prediction for DSPN, SUD, and their interaction. The identified features can serve as a biomarker for this complex condition and have potential clinical use. The results will enhance the knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms in blood and in brain for HIV-infected DSPN and SUD. Distal sensory polyneuropathy and substance use disorder are common in the HIV-infected population and can impact immune resilience and HIV outcomes. Applying a combination of epigenome-wide association and machine learning approaches, we aim to identify a panel of DNA methylation features in white blood cells for HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy and substance misuse that link to immune resilience, HIV frailty and mortality. The selected features can serve as biomarker for neuropathy and enhance our understanding of the interplay between neuropathy and substance misuse in HIV-infected population.",Feature selection of DNA methylation biosignatures for neuropathy with comorbid drug abuse in the setting of HIV infection,9776494,R01DA047820,"['Aging ', ' Association Learning ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cocaine ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Complication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' gp120(HIV) ', ' gp120 ENV Glycoprotein ', ' gp120 ', ' HTLV-III gp120 ', ' HIV env Protein gp120 ', ' HIV Envelope Glycoprotein gp120 ', ' HIV Envelope Protein gp120 ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Nervous Tissue ', ' Nerve Tissue ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Veterans ', ' Polyneuropathy ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' frailty ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Neuropathy ', ' neuropathic ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' brain tissue ', ' Performance ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' Genetic Fingerprintings ', ' DNA Typing ', ' DNA Profiling ', ' DNA Fingerprinting ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' immune function ', ' CD8B1 gene ', ' LYT3 ', ' CD8B1 ', ' CD8B ', ' CD8 ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Molecular ', ' painful neuropathy ', ' neuropathic pain ', ' epigenomics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Advanced Development ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' neurotoxic ', ' biosignature ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' cocaine use ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' epigenome ', ' model building ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' epigenome-wide association studies ', ' epigenome wide association analysis ', ' EWAS ', ' opioid use ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opiate use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' drug misuse ', ' medication misuse ', ' substance misuse ', ' Women’s Interagency HIV Study ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,599984,0.21621024663572
"CNS Viral Escape in HIV-infected Adults Project Summary The goal of this project is to understand mechanisms leading to CNS viral escape in HIV-infected adults on suppressive antiretroviral therapy, particularly the role of drug resistance. Despite current antiretroviral therapies (ART), viral escape in CSF is estimated to occur in 4-20% of patients with plasma suppression, representing a barrier to HIV cure. Factors associated with CSF escape include low-level viremia, prior virologic failure, low CD4 nadir, and long duration of HIV infection, but underlying mechanisms and influence of ART drug CNS penetration, drug resistance mutations (DRMs), size of the brain reservoir, and neuroinflammation on CSF escape remain unclear. M184V/I, which confers resistance to FTC/3TC, is the most common nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) DRM detected in blood. Preliminary studies showed M184V/I was frequently detected in patients with CSF escape despite plasma suppression, often detected together with thymidine analog resistance mutations (TAMs) in CSF. Moreover, we demonstrated a significant association between protease inhibitor (PI)-based ART regimens and CSF escape in patients with plasma suppression. Given low CNS penetration of PIs, patients with plasma M184V/I, particularly those on PI-based ART including tenofovir, have increased risk of CSF escape as a consequence of inadequate CNS penetration of ART regimens when M184V/I is present, leading to incomplete suppression of myeloid cell reservoirs in brain while selecting for TAMs and other DRMs in the CNS. To investigate these questions, we will use clinical samples and data from well-characterized cohorts followed longitudinally to characterize viral reservoirs in plasma, CSF, and brain for evidence of ongoing viral replication, profile DRMs in the RT, PR, and IN genes, and evaluate neuroinflammatory and blood-brain barrier biomarkers in patients with CSF escape. These studies will provide important insights into causes of CNS viral escape that are relevant for optimizing clinical management and overcoming obstacles to HIV cure.

"Evaluating predictors of HIV vaccine efficacy: Statistical methods for estimation, testing, and inference PROJECT SUMMARY We do not have a broadly efficacious vaccine against HIV, a virus that causes approximately 2 million new infections each year. Current proof-of-concept studies using broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV aim to understand how prevention varies with genotypic characteristics of the virus. Since performing an exhaustive search over all genotypic characteristics results in low statistical power to detect effects after adjusting for multiple comparisons, researchers typically pre-specify a small number of features to focus on. There is growing interest in using machine learning-based methods to both corroborate prior understanding and suggest new important genotypic characteristics in predicting sensitivity of the HIV virus to bnAbs. While machine learning-based methods have the potential to yield valid predictive models, issues remain in using these methods for estimating importance. The proposed research will address three such issues: developing a model-free variable importance measure, incorporating information from complex sampling designs, and valid statistical inference both when a genotypic feature is truly important and when it is not. First, the main classical tool for evaluating the importance of characteristics is the ANOVA decomposition, which makes strong modeling assumptions. Machine learning-based methods use minimal assumptions; however, these methods do not generally admit valid statistical inference, and the importance estimates are intimately tied to the technique employed. We will employ an approach based on ideas from the theory of semiparametric estimation and inference to develop a model-free measure of variable importance with valid confidence intervals for the true importance. Second, many HIV vaccine trials incorporate a nested case-control study, where additional information is measured on a subset of the trial participants. Estimating importance only using the subset ignores information from the remaining participants, resulting in a loss of efficiency and potentially adding some bias in estimating variable importance. The proposed research will develop methods that properly account for the sampling design. Finally, to determine if a set of features can be excluded from further analyses, we need a procedure for testing if the feature set truly has no importance. Hypothesis testing using machine learning-based methods is challenging, but we will build on recent advances in semiparametric inference to develop valid procedures for hypothesis testing in the context of variable importance. By combining advances in machine learning technology with ideas from semiparametric estimation and inference, we will determine important feature sets in predicting sensitivity of the HIV virus to bnAbs. In addition to yielding a deeper understanding of HIV neutralization, this information will allow researchers to make the best possible use of data from current clinical trials. This, in turn, could lead to either a shorter time to an HIV vaccine or new bnAbs in the research pipeline that are more broadly efficacious or potent. Any of these outcomes will transform preventative care for patients at risk of HIV infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients living with HIV or AIDS usually require a combination of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and supportive care for life. Understanding how features of the HIV genotype explain the susceptibility of the HIV virus to neutralization by broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV could lead to a broadly efficacious vaccine against HIV infection, either by using a combination of bnAbs or by developing more potent or longer lasting bnAbs that target certain important regions of the HIV genotype. These advances have the potential to make a large public health impact by reducing the number of incident HIV infections, thus reducing the use of ART and the need for supportive care.","Evaluating predictors of HIV vaccine efficacy: Statistical methods for estimation, testing, and inference",9769500,F31AI140836,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Amino Acid Sequence ', ' protein sequence ', ' Primary Protein Structure ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Analysis of Variance ', ' Variance Analyses ', ' ANOVA ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Infection ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Nested Case-Control Study ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaccines ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' human immunodeficiency virus vaccine ', ' HIV/AIDS Vaccines ', ' HIV vaccine ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' tool ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' exhaustion ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' neutralizing antibody ', ' interest ', ' virus characteristic ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' case control ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HIV-1 vaccine ', ' HIV1 vaccine ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' vaccine efficacy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' HIV prevention trial ', ' vaccine candidate ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' vaccine trial ', ' vaccine study ', ' vaccination trial ', ' vaccination study ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' semiparametric ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2019,22457,0.31820251669224897
"Neuroimmune mechanisms of depression in adults with HIV infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to understand neuroimmune mechanisms of depression in adults with HIV infection through analysis of plasma and CSF exosomes and the relationship of exosome protein cargo to inflammation and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism. Systemic inflammation in HIV infection and other conditions is associated with increased risk of depression through mechanisms involving altered tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism and other unknown mechanisms. Exosomes mediate cell-cell communication during inflammation and other conditions, but their role in neuroimmune interactions involved in depression have not been defined. Preliminary studies showed increased levels of circulating exosomes in HIV patients on ART compared to controls. Moreover, we identified heat shock proteins, Wnt proteins, and other protein cargo in these exosomes that correlate with HIV status, altered tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism, and depressive symptoms. Given that dysregulated Wnt/GSK3-β signaling and inflammatory responses have been linked to depression and other mood disorders, these findings suggest that circulating exosomes may play a role in neuroimmune interactions that impact depression through effects on Wnt/GSK3-β and/or TLR-mediated signaling. To address these questions, we will use clinical samples and data from well characterized HIV+ cohorts followed longitudinally to characterize plasma and CSF exosomes and their relationship to depression, inflammation markers, and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolites. Bioinformatics, computational modeling, and cell culture models will be used to build and test models that predict depression status and relevant pathways. This approach may define novel relationships between circulating exosome cargo and neuroimmune mechanisms of depression in HIV infection, potentially suggesting new therapeutic targets based on the biology of exosomes.

"Defining the impact of injection drug use on antiretroviral therapy and HIV treatment outcomes: an (epi)genomic approach Although uptake of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in people who inject drugs (PWID) infected with HIV has increased dramatically in the past decade, poor health outcomes including non-AIDS-related comorbidity and mortality in HIV-infected PWID on cART remains a significant public health problem. A crucial knowledge gap is a lack of the understanding about how injection drug use (IDU) impacts the course of HIV disease. Differences in gene regulation affected by IDU and non-adherence to cART are likely to affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these treatments that may result in poor outcomes. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify genomic signatures for PWID and to link PWID-associated genomic signals to HIV outcomes in the context of cART exposure (i.e., levels in plasma). Our overall hypothesis is that PWID accrue DNA methylation (DNAm) and transcriptome variations that impact on health outcomes, and which may be explained in part by variability in cART exposure. This hypothesis is built on our previous findings showing that IDU significantly altered the blood DNA methylome in HIV-infected individuals. Furthermore, DNAm signatures associated with IDU differentiated less and greater HIV disease frailty. To test this hypothesis, our approach will first perform epigenome-wide DNAm association analysis and transcriptome-wide association analysis in HIV-infected PWID as compared to HIV-infected non-PWID who are treated with cART in two independent cohorts. Second, we will test the relationship between PWID-associated differentially methylated positions (DMP) or regions (DMR) and differential gene expression (DGE) on cART variability in plasma and also their relationships with HIV frailty and mortality. Last, we propose to integrate genetic variation (single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP]), DNAm, and gene expression that differs by HIV-infected PWID/non-PWID status. Our goal is to identify DMP or DMR and DGE between HIV-infected PWID and non-PWID in the context of cART and to apply epigenetic and transcriptomic signatures as biomarkers to predict HIV frailty and mortality. The application proposes the first integrative pharmacogenomic approach of genetic variants, epigenomic and transcriptomic associations for HIV-infected PWID in the context of cART. We expect to identify PWID- associated genes that can predict HIV cART treatment outcomes. The predictive model resulting from this project can inform biomarker identification for HIV outcomes. The proposal is the first step towards the understanding of pharmacogenomics and pharamcoepigenomics in PWID with HIV infection. The results will fill the knowledge gap of the biological basis of IDU effects on HIV outcomes and provide evidence to prioritize genes for future research of their functions in HIV progression. People who inject drug use infected with HIV have high medical comorbidity and poor health outcomes despite the availability of combination anti-retroviral therapy. Our integrative pharmacogenomic approach aims to define a set of genes associated with HIV-infected injection drug use and anti-retroviral therapy that predict HIV outcomes. Our work will generate not only knowledge about how injection drug use perturbs the HIV- infected host epigenome and transcriptome, but also potential biomarkers to predict individual HIV outcomes in the context of combination antiretroviral therapy.",Defining the impact of injection drug use on antiretroviral therapy and HIV treatment outcomes: an (epi)genomic approach,9787442,R01DA047063,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' indexing ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Public Health ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' uptake ', ' gene function ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' frailty ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' persons who inject drugs ', ' people who inject illicit drugs ', ' people who inject drugs ', ' PWID ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' cohort ', ' intravenous drug use ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Data ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' therapy prediction ', ' predict treatment response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Gene Combinations ', ' Tissue-Specific Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression ', ' Differential Gene Expression ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' epigenomics ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Outcome ', ' transcriptomics ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' non-drug ', ' nondrug ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' injection drug use ', ' methylome ', ' epigenome ', ' genetic approach ', ' Genomic approach ', ' genomic strategy ', ' genomic effort ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' bead chip ', ' BeadChip ', ' potential biomarker ', ' potential biological marker ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' epigenome-wide association studies ', ' epigenome wide association analysis ', ' EWAS ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' biomarker identification ', ' marker identification ', ' genomic signature ', ' genomic classifier ', ' Women’s Interagency HIV Study ', ' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ', ' PK/PD ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,592854,0.34826530267261024
"Statistical Methods for Evaluating and Guiding Implementation of New HIV Prevention Strategies PROJECT SUMMARY The HIV prevention ﬁeld has advanced dramatically in recent years through the development of antiretroviral- based prevention strategies such as Treatment-as-Prevention and oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Numer- ous challenges remain that impede the implementation of these interventions and HIV remains a major global health problem. We need new preventive interventions to combat the pandemic. The rapid advancements in the ﬁeld have complicated the statistical design of efﬁcacy trials of new interventions. For instance, oral PrEP is now part of the standard HIV prevention package offered to trial participants, which poses challenges in ensur- ing adequate statistical power. Currently, available statistical methods for guiding the implementation of effective interventions are inadequate. Considering this complex HIV prevention context, our goal in Aim 1 is to iden- tify suitable efﬁcacy trial designs for evaluating the next generation of HIV prevention tools. We will consider crossover designs, sequential randomization designs, active-arm only designs, and non-inferiority designs with adaptive margins; each of these approaches addresses a key limitation of the prototypical phase 2b/3 trial de- sign currently in use. Through simulation studies and application to candidate interventions, we will investigate the relative statistical performance of the designs. We will also work with leaders in the HIV prevention ﬁeld, to identify the clinical, ethical, logistical issues and other critical factors that must be considered. We will use these factors to reﬁne our design comparisons and to identify the trial design that is most appropriate for each setting. Under Aim 2, we will address speciﬁc implementation questions in HIV prevention, through the development of improved statistical analysis methods. We will develop methods for evaluating sub-population-speciﬁc HIV risk and prevention efﬁcacy, to identify strategies for implementing interventions, and for bridging HIV incidence and prevention efﬁcacy to new settings or populations. Our approach will rely on fewer assumptions than existing methods, use a framework that leverages statistical learning to extract information from multiple predictors of risk and efﬁcacy, and accommodate data from multiple sources. We will use important and relevant datasets in HIV prevention and simulation studies designed to mimic their structure and content to gauge the performance of the approaches. Our team members include lead statistical investigators in the major HIV prevention trial networks, with considerable expertise in statistical methods development and clinical trial design, and established collabo- rations with other leaders in the clinical and laboratory science of HIV prevention. Our positions and connections make us uniquely poised to translate the novel methods into practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current drugs and other preventive interventions have made important contributions to the ﬁght against HIV/AIDS. However, we will need a larger tool-box of drugs, vaccines, and other interventions to end the HIV pandemic. This project will develop and assess speciﬁc research study designs to evaluate new interventions in the presence of existing interventions, as well as provide statistical analysis methods for guiding the implementation of those that prove effective.",Statistical Methods for Evaluating and Guiding Implementation of New HIV Prevention Strategies,9971891,R56AI143418,"['Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' mAbs ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Placebos ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Translating ', ' Vaccines ', ' Work ', ' Injectable ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' method development ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Crossover Design ', ' Cross-Over Designs ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' Source ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' Infusion ', ' Performance ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' pandemic disease ', ' pandemic ', ' cost ', ' fight against ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Population ', ' HIV prevention trials network ', ' combat ', ' effective intervention ', ' efficacy testing ', ' arm ', ' trial design ', ' vaccine trial ', ' vaccine study ', ' vaccination trial ', ' vaccination study ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R56,2019,815924,0.30007406049469587
"Tough Talks: A Disclosure Intervention for HIV+ YMSM PROJECT SUMMARY Men who have sex with men (MSM) account for nearly two-thirds all of new HIV infections in the United States (US) and young MSM (YMSM) are the only risk group experiencing a significant increase in HIV incidence. Among youth, 67 percent report not disclosing to their first time sex partners.4 Disclosing of one’s HIV status is important for accessing support which can lead to improved medication adherence and retention in care. Those who disclose are more likely to use condoms with uninfected sex partners5 and mathematical modeling estimates that increased HIV status disclosure to sex partners may reduce transmissions by 40-60%.6,7 Further, disclosure may motivate uninfected sex partners to seek testing and reduce their own HIV transmission behaviors. Given the potential benefits and challenges associated with disclosure, there is a need for sophisticated interventions that can assist MSM, with the disclosure process. Virtual reality provides a unique environment for users to practice HIV disclosure. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven disclosure may offer advantages over in-person role play through the use of realistic avatars that represent potential romantic partners, and probabilistic settings where users envision having disclosure conversations. Users have the opportunity to practice disclosing and experience a variety of responses and outcomes. During Phase I of this project we developed an iPad based virtual reality system that features three avatars, two virtual locations and three disclosure scenarios which represent a variety of common disclosure experiences and contexts experienced by YMSM. In Phase II we will further enhance Tough Talks and develop a full-feature automated version to test via a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) through the newly created Center for Innovative Technologies (iTech) across the Prevention and Care Continuum, an NIH-funded center to support adolescent HIV research. The aims of this Phase II SBIR are: 1) Refine and enhance the current Tough Talks disclosure scenarios to include additional content, characters and virtual environments. Formative work with YMSM (aged 16-29 years) will inform development and we will work with a leader in AI software to incorporate natural language into the AI driven scenarios; 2) Develop the Tough Talks stand-alone intervention. This fully automated intervention will include the AI driven disclosure scenarios created in aim 1 as well as a virtual disclosure coach to guide participants through the intervention goal-setting interactive exercises and interactive educational videos. Following development, a technical pilot to optimize functionality and technical performance will be conducted with 8-10 YMSM and; 3) Conduct a three-arm combined efficacy/effectiveness trial to compare the intervention delivered online (Arm 1) versus in the clinic (Arm 2) compared to standard of care (SOC) disclosure messaging only. Primary outcomes of HIV viral load and condomless anal intercourse (CAI) will be assessed at intervention completion (1 month) and at 6-month follow-up. We will estimate transmissions averted and program costs of each arm (Months 19-36). PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite monumental advances in HIV treatment and prevention technologies, disclosing a positive HIV status to an intimate partner remains a daunting and a complex undertaking. However, those who disclose are more likely to use condoms with uninfected sex partners and mathematical modeling estimates that increased HIV status disclosure to sex partners may reduce transmissions by 40-60%. Further, disclosing of one’s HIV status is important for accessing support which can lead to improved retention in care, antiretroviral adherence and decreased viral load.

"The Impact of Aging and HIV Infection on Immunologic and Transcriptomic Signatures of Influenza Vaccine Response It is estimated that approximately half of HIV-infected individuals in the United States are over 50 years of age. Aging of the HIV-infected population has linked alterations in immune responses associated with age and the immunologic consequences of chronic HIV infection. This intersection of HIV and aging will influence host defense against infection and response to vaccines. As a result, understanding the nexus of HIV-associated immune activation and immunosenescence takes on particular urgency. We will leverage insights from our published and ongoing studies on the effects of aging on dysregulated innate immune pattern recognition receptor (PRR) function, a novel population of pro-inflammatory IL-7 receptor alow effector memory (EM) CD8 T cells that are expanded in HIV-negative older adults, and on expansion of EM CD8 T cells in older HIV-positive adults. We have also elucidated gene expression and immunologic signatures of influenza vaccine response in young and older HIV-negative adults. These findings position us to illuminate the effects of aging and HIV infection on innate and adaptive immune function, particularly following influenza vaccination. To address these questions, we have assembled an interdisciplinary group of investigators with expertise in the study of aging of the innate and adaptive human immune systems, and in HIV immunology, biology and clinical care. Our overarching hypothesis is that the pro-inflammatory environment associated with age and with suppressed HIV infection potentiates immunosenescence in older adults with HIV disease. To test this hypothesis, we will enroll young (age 21-35) and older (age over 65) adults with HIV infection receiving high-dose influenza vaccine. We will employ state of the art methods including multichannel mass cytometry on whole blood to assess development and activation of major populations (e.g. monocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils), including novel studies of platelets pre- and post-vaccine. We will evaluate innate immune PRR function (including Toll-like and NOD-like receptor family members), where we previously found age-associated alterations in cytokine production and costimulatory protein expression that were related to influenza vaccine response. We will also study T cell responses to in vitro vaccine antigen stimulation, including the IL-7 receptor alow EM CD8 T cell subset. Statistical modeling will include clinical and functional covariates (e.g. CD4+ T cell count, estimated duration of HIV disease and of ART, medical co-morbidities, medication use, functional status). Finally, we will derive gene expression signatures of influenza vaccine response in young and older adults with HIV disease, and compare these to those we previously identified in HIV-negative adults. We will employ state of the art analytic methods to integrate gene expression and immunologic data to obtain a comprehensive view of the human immune response in the context of age and immune suppression. These studies ultimately are aimed at identifying pathways amenable to pharmacologic targeting to improve immune and vaccine responses in older (and young) adults with HIV disease. The proposed studies focus on understanding how aging and HIV infection affect the function of the immune system, particularly in response to influenza vaccination, to identify cell types and biologic pathways that are potential targets for the development of treatments to improve immune function.",The Impact of Aging and HIV Infection on Immunologic and Transcriptomic Signatures of Influenza

"Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center Project Summary  This application is for the renewal of the Study to Help the AIDS Research Effort (SHARE), which has been the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) since 1984. The MACS was established with sites in Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles, initially to study the natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men and later, with the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the treated history of HIV infection, including the relationship between long-term controlled HIV infection and chronic diseases and co-morbidities associated with aging. To reflect these changing priorities in HIV research, SHARE has had subsequent enrollments to balance proportions of HIV- and HIV+ men and to reflect the HIV epidemic more accurately. Men enrolled have been followed semi annually since 1984 or enrollment and have a) provided questionnaire data, physical exam data, laboratory data (including HIV serostatus, T cell subset measurements, and HIV viral load measurements), and a large repository of plasma, serum, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other specimens; and these have permitted SHARE and MACS to make major contributions to the understanding of treated and untreated HIV disease, and comorbidities associated with increased survival due to antiretroviral treatment.  The present application, in response to RFA-HL-19-008, aims to extend followup of the SHARE cohort (about 640 men) from 2019 to 2026, to allow merger of SHARE (and the other MACS sites) with the nine sites of the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) into a single cohort, termed the MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS), that will include both men and women. The specific aims of the CCS are outlined in a parallel application from the putative Data and Coordinating Center (DACC) of the CCS, and the 10 Specific Aims of that single cohort are outlined in the DACC application for the CCS; these include Cardiovascular (CV), Pulmonary/Sleep (PS), Neurocognitive NC), Aging (AG), Cancer, HIV Pathogenesis (PA), Psychosocial (PS), Health Disparities, Platform (PL), and Career Development (CD) Aims. The specific aims of the SHARE Clinical Research Site (CRS) are to: 1) play a leading role in the achievement 7 of these Aims by the CCS (i.e., CV, PS, AG, PA, PS, PL, and CD), including serving as a reading center for echocardiography and sleep studies; 2) to contribute to the achievement of the other 3 CCS aims, and 3) to implement all applicable CCS protocols and support the scientific goals of the CCS. Local initiatives on inflammation and physical activity will also support these aims, which take full advantage of the extensive follow-up and repository of biological specimens already available from this cohort and which will be extended under this proposal, enabling further contributions to our understanding and care of comorbidities and other health issues faced by people living with HIV today. Narrative This application is for renewal for 7 years of the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a longstanding study of the natural and treated histories of HIV infection men who have sex with men in four US cites (Baltimore-Washington, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Chicago) which has made many important contributions to the treatment and understanding of HIV infection since 1984. For the next 7 years, we propose to integrate our site with the 9 WIHS sites into a new MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS) which will follow men already enrolled in Baltimore and Washington, DC, and also recruit a few new men replacing those who have been lost to the study, in order to better understand the long-term consequences of living with HIV, including possible effects on chronic diseases and aging, and to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of these consequences.",Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center,9694071,U01HL146201,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Chicago ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' cold storage ', ' cold preservation ', ' Cryofixation ', ' Cryopreservation ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster

"Predictive Analytics for Retention in HIV Care Retention in care is essential to HIV treatment and prevention, yet less than half of people living with HIV in the U.S. are retained in medical care. Effective retention interventions, such as intensive case management and patient navigation, are highly resource intensive. With diminishing resources for HIV care, better approaches are needed to identify patients at highest risk for retention failure who would most benefit from retention resources. A predictive model may quantify a specific patient's risk of future retention-in-care failure based on his/her unique characteristics. Such a predictive model based on electronic health data and supplemental social factor informed data could be automated to generate risk prediction in real time. Instead of attempting to locate and re-engage patients who are “lost to follow-up” as is the current practice, a predictive model would allow case managers to identify at risk clients and intervene to prevent retention failure before it occurs. I have a strong background in clinical informatics, biostatistics, and epidemiology. Through this K23, I will further develop my skills in longitudinal data analysis and advanced data analytics and create a predictive model of retention in care. In Aim 1, I will create a predictive model of retention in care using EHR data from a large clinical data research network spanning 11 healthcare systems in Chicago, utilizing mixed effects logistic regression and random forest. Through Aim 2, I will evaluate whether the addition of supplemental social factor informed electronic data sources into the predictive model enhances its performance (e.g., unstructured text of EHR notes, geospatial data, social media data). Finally, in Aim 3, I will explore the feasibility of using the model in real time to increase retention efforts for at-risk patients. I will complete this project under the supervision of my mentor (Dr. John Schneider), co-mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), and my advisory team (Dr. Robert Gibbons, Rayid Ghani, and Dr. C. Hendricks Brown). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in HIV research, EHR research, longitudinal data analysis, natural language processing, social media data, implementation science, and ethics. In addition, they serve as Directors of the Chicago Center for HIV Elimination (Schneider), Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Meltzer), Center for Data Science and Public Policy (Ghani), Center for Health Statistics (Gibbons), and Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for Drug Abuse and HIV (Brown). An integrated program of coursework, seminars, structured mentorship, research activities, and conferences will provide me with the skills necessary to complete the proposed research and transition to independence. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator utilizing HIV informatics to develop prediction models and tools to inform HIV prevention and treatment across the HIV care continuum. The mentorship and training that I will receive through this K23 award will provide me with the foundation necessary to pursue that goal and this proposal will form the basis for future R01 proposals. Retention in care is essential for HIV treatment and prevention, yet less than half of people living with HIV in the United States are retained in medical care. Electronic data, including advanced electronic health records, geospatial data, and social media profile data, can be used to create an automated predictive model to identify individuals at highest risk for retention in care failure. Instead of attempting to locate and re-engage patients who are no longer retained in care as is the current practice, a predictive model will allow case managers to identify at risk individuals and provide personalized retention resources based on individual risk factors before patients disengage from care.",Predictive Analytics for Retention in HIV Care,9846472,K23MH121190,"['Adult ', '

"Mining real-time social media big data to monitor HIV: Development and Ethical Issues Social “big data” holds information with wide-ranging implications for addressing issues along the HIV care continuum. Social big data refers to information from social media and online platforms on which individuals and communities create, share, and discuss content. One in four people worldwide, or over a billion people, are publically documenting their activities, intentions, moods, opinions, and social interactions on these sites. They are doing so with increasing volume and velocity, including 400 million “tweets” per day on Twitter and 4.75 billion content items shared per day on Facebook. With an increasing number of these platforms supporting access to publicly-available user data, social big data analysis is a promising new approach for attaining organic observations of behavior that can be used to monitor and predict real-world public health problems, such as HIV incidence. New tools such as social data are therefore needed to supplement existing HIV data collection methods.  In preliminary research, our team developed the first approach that identifies psychological and behavioral characteristics from social big data (>550 million tweets) found to be associated with HIV diagnoses. Since groups at the highest risk for HIV (e.g., minority populations) are the fastest growing Twitter users, and because social media users have been found to publicly share personal information, we identified and collected tweets suggesting HIV risk behaviors (e.g., drug use, high-risk sexual behaviors, etc.) and modeled them alongside CDC statistics on HIV diagnoses. We found a significant positive relationship between HIV- related tweets and county-level HIV cases, controlling for socioeconomic status measures and other variables.  The problem is that this approach is not currently scalable for use by HIV researchers and public health organizations. Although public health agencies are interested in mining social data to address HIV, current tools are not accessible to most health scientists, as the tools require advanced computer science expertise. For example, analyzing 500 million tweets a day requires expertise in big data engineering, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. Developing a single platform for mining social data that has been designed and tested by and for HIV researchers could provide a significant impact on HIV prevention, testing, and treatment. We seek to create a single automated platform that collects social media data; identifies, codes, and labels tweets that suggest HIV-related behaviors; and ultimately predicts regional HIV incidence. Because of the potential ethical issues associated with mining people's data, we also seek to interview staff at local and regional HIV organization and participants affected by HIV to gain their perspectives on the ethical issues associated with this approach. The software developed from this application will be shared with HIV researchers and health care workers to provide additional tools that can be used to combat the spread of HIV.   Project Narrative  Surveillance and monitoring of HIV and related risk behaviors is a top priority for public health organizations. This project is of particularly high impact because it seeks to 1) develop software to allow (non- technical) researchers to analyze real-time conversations from social media big data to monitor HIV diagnoses, and 2) interview participants to learn about the ethical issues that need to be addressed when building this software. The software developed from this application will be shared with HIV researchers and health care workers to provide additional tools that can be used to combat the spread of HIV.",Mining real-time social media big data to monitor HIV: Development and Ethical Issues,9987247,R01AI132030,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Moods ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Label ', ' Site ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' interest ', ' behavior observation ', ' behavioral observation ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' health organization ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' combat ', ' public health priorities ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' social media ', ' Data Engineering ', ' Facebook ', ' Twitter ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2019,794640,0.24470427103339218
"High-throughput Deep Sequencing Assay to Reliably Measure the HIV Reservoir during Antiretroviral Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study is designed to meet the goals of the RFA ""Innovative assays to quantify the latent HIV reservoir"" that can ""facilitate proof-of-concept studies for curing HIV infection."" To meet this challenge we propose to develop and validate a combined next generation sequencing (Pacific Biosciences single-molecule, real time (SMRT) sequencing) and bioinformatics platform to accurately measure replication-competent provirus (i.e. Proviral Phenotypic Predictor; P3). An over-arching objective would be for the assay to have a ""higher throughput, faster turnaround, lower cost, and greater reproducibility"" than the current standard quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA). We will develop and validate the proposed P3 platform based on international standard procedures for diagnostic molecular methods (i.e. CAP and OIE) using latently infected cells from HIV-infected individuals on optimized antiretroviral therapy for at least 2 years. These participants will be well-characterize to estimated duration of infection at the start of their therapy, and will represent high, medium and low levels of HIV DNA levels. Such characterizations will be necessary to adequately address the dynamic range of the proposed P3 platform. Once P3 methods have been optimized, we will rigorously compare P3 and QVOA methods in their ability to characterize the replication competent proviral reservoir and by costs and turnaround time for results. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal is specifically designed to develop and validate a high-throughput next generation sequencing and bioinformatics platform (P3=""Proviral Phenotypic Predictor"") to fully characterize the latent HIV reservoir through quantification and sequencing of Full-length HIV provirus. We will determine the accuracy and exact error rate for our proposed platform, and we will compare this new assay to the standard quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA) to delineate what amount of intact and replication competent HIV genomes is not inducible (and therefore not recognized) by QVOA. Being able to characterize each part of the HIV DNA population, and especially determine what proportion of intact and replication competent HIV DNA is not inducible by standard QVOA, will allow us to better evaluate the impact of any intervention aimed at reducing the HIV latent reservoir. 1",High-throughput Deep Sequencing Assay to Reliably Measure the HIV Reservoir during Antiretroviral Therapy,9614267,R01AI120009,"['Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infection ', ' Methods ', ' Phenotype ', ' Phaseolus vulgaris Lectins ', ' Kidney Bean Lectins ', ' Phytohemagglutinins ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Proviruses ', ' Rest ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 helper T cell ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Nonsense Codon ', ' Premature Stop Codon ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Viral ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' PBMC ', ' expression cloning ', ' Participant ', ' Appearance ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' single molecule ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Techniques ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Technics ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Methods ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' International ', ' Interruption ', ' Reproducibility ', ' in vivo ', ' Allogenic ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' deep sequencing ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Impact evaluation ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' open source ', ' public health relevance ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' HIV Genome ', ' HIV1 genome ', ' HIV-1 genome ', ' viral rebound ', ' virus rebound ', ' single molecule real time sequencing ', ' single molecule realtime sequencing ', ' SMRT-seq ', ' SMRT sequencing ', ' ']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,748791,0.29035726448441807

"An Adaptive Strategy for Preventing and Treating Lapses of Retention in Adult HIV Care II (ADAPT-R II) Abstract This R34 application is best understood in the context of both a NIH-funded sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) “Adaptive Strategies to Prevent and Treat Lapses of Retention (ADAPT-1)” nearing completion and a future trial (ADAPT-3) motivated by observations from the ADAPT-1. Retention in HIV treatment over long periods of time represents an archetypal complex public health problem and requires innovative solutions. The diversity of intensities and types of barriers to engagement mean that no single intervention is needed by all nor will work for all in need. For example, counseling could help a patient experiencing stigma, but will not help an individual who wants to come but cannot afford transportation. To respond to this conundrum, we carried out a SMART (ADAPT-1) to test a family of adaptive retention strategies. By maintaining lower intensity interventions in those doing well, adaptive strategies optimize efficiency, while escalating in those not doing well enhances effectiveness. In ADAPT-1, we initially randomized patients to one of three lower intensity interventions (standard of care (SOC), SMS messages and a conditional cash transfer). Only those who fail to be consistently retained are re-randomized to one of three more intensive interventions (SOC outreach, SMS message with a conditional cash transfer, or a navigator). Emerging ADAPT-1 results (in forthcoming publications) confirm our original hypothesis that pegging the retention intervention to patient behavior improves outcomes, the study also revealed additional opportunities to extend a “precision public health” paradigm. Specifically, we observed that different patients (based on sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics) respond differentially to different adaptive retention strategies. This observation begs a further hypothesis: use of predictive analytics (optimized with cutting-edge machine learning techniques) to distribute each intervention (e.g., SOC, cash transfer, SMS) to those patients most likely to respond to that intervention can achieve further gains in effectiveness and efficiency over any single sequenced retention strategy, even if strategy is itself already adaptive. We plan a future R01 application to test a machine learning based distribution of retention interventions as compared to best single sequential adaptive interventions (from ADAPT-1). To prepare for the novel trial, we propose this R34, to (1) develop and test the information technology basis for delivering on-demand predictions to health care workers in the field, (2) refine the statistical foundations of machine learning ability to predict through simulations and (3) assess the fit of machine learning based recommendations in the organizational, policy and ethical context of health systems in Kenya. Project Narrative Engagement in HIV treatment, both retention and adherence, represents a persistent, complex health behavior problem in Africa where public health success over the long run demands innovative approaches to retain and virally suppress patients. We propose bringing the cutting edge of data science to the front lines of the HIV response by developing and testing a machine learning-based algorithm “Personalized Retention Recommendation and Learning Systems” (PERLS) to assign a limited set of scalable retention strategies for people living with HIV who are most likely to respond to those interventions in Kenya. This proposed R34 will lay the technological, statistical, and implementation groundwork for a future R01 application (ADAPT-3) which will test the effectiveness of PERLS on clinical endpoints and thereby advance a novel “precisions public health” approach to HIV treatment in Africa.",An Adaptive Strategy for Preventing and Treating Lapses of Retention in Adult HIV Care II (ADAPT-R II),9846949,R34MH121224,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Africa ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Environment ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health behavior ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Kenya ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Savings ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Organizational Policy ', ' Privacy ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' Data Quality ', ' Funding ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Outcome Study ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' health record ', ' outreach ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' Information Technology ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' standard of care ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' learning ability ', ' learning competence ', ' learning achievement ', ' trial design ', ' retention rate ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Science ', ' improved outcome ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' Text Messaging ', ' texting ', ' short message service ', ' service delivery ', ' overtreatment ', ' over-treatment ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R34,2019,193954,0.2048274307390528
"Identifying Patterns of Cognitive, Motor, and Brain Structural Abnormalities Differentiating Alcohol Use Disorder with and without HIV Infection Comorbidity SUMMARY Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) occurs in the largest segment of individuals in the U.S. who are dependent on a substance. The co-occurrence of AUD in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is high, occurring at twice the rate as occurs in the general population. AUD and HIV infection each are responsible for disruption of brain structural integrity and cognitive and motor impairments, affect some different and some overlapping neural systems, but can also exacerbate the untoward effects on selective systems through synergistic or additive processes. The goal of this research project is to develop novel machine learning methods to differentiate the compounding factors and effects of these two disorders involving brain to improve the mechanistic and dynamic understanding of HIV/AUD comorbidity effects on the brain.  Efficient study of the untoward effects associated with the comorbidity of AUD and HIV on brain morphology requires identifying differences across multiple diagnostic groupings, i.e., healthy controls (CTRL), HIV-negative alcoholics (AUD), HIV-positive without alcohol dependency (HIV), and HIV-positive with alcohol dependency (HIV/AUD). Testing inferences across multiple diagnostic groupings of complex disorders commonly yields inconclusive or conflicting findings when done by conventional, univariate, cross-sectional study designs, which are constructed to model two cohorts at a time and hold ""nuisance"" variables constant with little power to include multiple factors comprising the complexity and dynamism that may well be relevant for distinguishing the primary disorders.  Herein, I propose to develop robust and reliable machine learning technology that can identify patterns from longitudinal MRI data unique to each cohort. This type of data-driven method is able to analyze all data points concurrently and thus provide alternative approaches to conventional methods, which focus on correlating subsets of data guided by expert domain knowledge. I envision that this project will expand my understanding of the neuropsychiatry of AUD and HIV and will also result in extending a mechanistic understanding of neurofactors relevant to HIV/AUD comorbidity. Improving the mechanistic understanding of HIV/AUD comorbidity and diagnostic differences may enhance physician and caregiver awareness and aid clinicians in developing targeted therapeutic options for sustained symptomatic benefits.

"MRI data fusion to investigate effects of drug abuse on HIV neurological complications Project Summary  Despite widespread use of antiretroviral therapy, nearly half of the 1.2 million Americans living with HIV experience neurocognitive impairments (NCI) that negatively impact daily functioning. HIV-associated NCI is estimated to be the most common form of midlife NCI worldwide. Drug abuse, a highly prevalent comorbidity in HIV+ persons, increases the risk of HIV-associated NCI. Unimodal MRI studies have shown that HIV and drug abuse are each linked with a distinct set of structural and functional alterations in the brain, but how they interact is not well understood. Conventional unimodal analyses are limited in their ability to characterize complex neuropsychiatric diseases because each modality provides an incomplete view of the brain. In contrast, we propose to use innovative fusion approaches that exploit the richness of multimodal data to discover covariations across multiple neuroimaging modalities and cognitive measures simultaneously. This proposal capitalizes on existing data from 3 completed NIDA-funded projects on the neurobehavioral effects of HIV and drug abuse. When combined, the dataset will consist of 217 unique cases (108 HIV+ and 109 HIV-) with in-depth substance use histories, multimodal brain images (i.e., structural, diffusion, and resting-state functional MRI), comprehensive neurocognitive batteries, and a wide range of other phenotypic data. The central hypothesis is that HIV-specific co-alterations in gray matter volume and white matter integrity shape neural functioning and in turn NCI, and that cocaine use worsens these alterations due to its long-term effects on neural circuitry. Using complementary multimodal analyses (supervised fusion and connectomics), we aim to: (1) identify neural biomarkers of HIV neurological disease and associated NCI; and (2) test cocaine as a moderator of HIV-specific co-alterations in brain structure and function and associated NCI. In addition, the project will develop new, advanced methods to improve MRI data quality for cross-study harmonization and to optimize the prediction of NCI based on multimodal indices. This amalgamated dataset provides an unprecedented opportunity to test new and clinically important hypotheses about the neural substrates of HIV- associated NCI in the context of drug abuse. The proposal responds directly to the need for research to “characterize brain morphology or function that is aberrant as a consequence of chronic drug use” and “[its role] in the evolving dynamics of HIV/AIDS pathogenesis, treatment, prevention, and service delivery” [PAR- 16-234]. This research also addresses high priority topics for AIDS-designated funding, including investigation of neurological complications [NOT-15-137]. Building upon a sound premise and robust preliminary data, this innovative project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers of neuroHIV that may facilitate diagnosis and treatment monitoring in active drug users and serve as targets for clinical interventions to mitigate the burden caused by HIV-associated NCI.

"Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1 Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health. Project Narrative  This project aims at developing next-generation neutralization fingerprinting algorithms for the analysis of antibody specificities in polyclonal responses against HIV-1.

"Health Informatics to Model the Scott County HIV Outbreak ABSTRACT Many regions of the United States, particularly rural and frontier areas, lack the resources to proactively identify isolated infectious disease outbreaks. Scott County Indiana experienced an HIV outbreak in 2014- 2015, resulting in approximately 200 new HIV infections. If not for a vigilant Disease Intervention Specialist (DIS) who noticed an escalating number of HIV infections in Scott County over a brief period of time, the outbreak could have been much worse. An isolated outbreak in resource-limited settings such as Scott County underscores the need for more innovative, automated, and real-time HIV biosurveillance systems in non-urban areas. To date, digital HIV epidemiologic research has relied almost exclusively on Twitter; however, this approach is likely too restrictive and has not yet yielded a promising approach to predicting HIV outbreaks. More heterogeneous sources of data--in addition to social media--may more efficiently predict the arrival of HIV in a community with limited surveillance resources. The proposed health informatics research will analyze historical time series data collected from 2014 through 2016 to identify predictor variables that model the Scott County HIV outbreak. Data to be analyzed include: (1) emergency room (ER) admissions and discharges related to opioid use and soft tissue infections related to drug abuse; (2) HIV testing surveillance data; (3) HCV incidence data; (4) search engine inquires of relevant topics, such as Google or Bing searches for “HIV testing” and “Opana”; (5) law enforcement arrest records (particularly those related to opioid possession and distribution); and (6) electronic healthcare reimbursement data of HIV-related treatments (e.g., post-exposure prophylaxis). Automated data/text mining and machine learning techniques will also be applied to (7) social media data (i.e., Twitter tweets and Reddit forum posts) that make reference to HIV, Opana, substance use, and other terms to determine if trends in social media data could have predicted HIV's arrival in, and transmission throughout, Scott County. Using the diverse data sources listed above, our team will correlate the time series of key predictor variables to identify the data source (or sources) most predictive of a known HIV outbreak. If our team develops a health informatics approach and algorithm(s) identifying trends in social media and other electronic data indicating an imminent HIV outbreak, state and county health departments can use these “signals” to increase the number of HIV testing and counseling sites in the affected area, health care providers can more aggressively screen for HIV/STI infection, syringe-service programs can be mobilized rapidly and targeted more efficiently, contact tracing activities can be initiated, and PEP and PrEP can be prescribed to those at risk for HIV infection in the geographic region of concern. This study will also examine feasibility issues related to the collection and analysis of electronic health information and social media data in HIV biosurveillance efforts, such as data accessibility, costs, and generalizability. Narrative In 2014, roughly 200 persons in rural Scott County Indiana were infected with HIV during an outbreak driven largely by widespread use of injected opioids, primarily Opana®. Had an automated biosurveillance system been in place, this isolated outbreak might have been identified at its earliest stages and a multi-faceted public health response could have been employed. Using heterogeneous sources of historical data from 2014 through 2016, the proposed health informatics research will analyze emergency room admissions and discharges for opioid overdose and soft tissue infections, social media posts, search engine inquiries, hepatitis C incidence data, and healthcare reimbursement data to determine if these data could have predicted the arrival and spread of HIV throughout Scott County Indiana.",Health Informatics to Model the Scott County HIV Outbreak,9851616,R21DA047893,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious

"Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in patient-oriented HIV research, seven of whom have secured K funding and four of whom are now R-funded . She is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. Her mentees will have access to a wealth of research opportunities in the context of the many large HIV-focused clinical trials and studies that Dr. Lockman leads (and led over the past 18 years) in Botswana and elsewhere, ranging from randomized trials of antiretroviral or antibiotic regimens (many in pregnant women and their infants) to observational and epidemiologic studies of clinical outcomes among HIV-infected adults and HIV-exposed children. In the proposed K24, she will leverage the unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a large ongoing randomized HIV combination prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000 with longitudinal cohort of 12,000 adults), in order to mentor investigators from Botswana and the US on pressing questions of substantial public health and clinical relevance to the severe epidemic still affecting sub-Saharan Africa. For context, UNAIDS is promoting high levels (90% or greater) of HIV diagnosis, antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage, and virologic suppression (“90-90-90” targets) to end the HIV epidemic. However, despite nearly meeting these targets in Botswana, we observe annual HIV incidence >1%. Furthermore, with more than 15% of the adult population of Botswana on ART (and recent implementation of universal ART), it is essential that we understand the implications of widespread treatment for clinical outcomes and non-communicable disease incidence in persons living with HIV at the population level. We will therefore: a) Characterize adults with recent HIV infection using predictive analysis, in order to identify groups at highest risk for HIV acquisition in the current epidemic, and augment our understanding with individual in-depth interviews with recently- infected adults; b) Study the feasibility, acceptability, and uptake of a targeted approach to TDF/FTC pre- exposure prophylaxis, offered to HIV-negative persons meeting this high-risk profile; c) Evaluate the impact of HIV (and of early ART) on clinical outcomes, including c ancer incidence and hypertension prevalence in HIV-infected vs. HIV-uninfected adults, and HIV-related outcomes among persons starting dolutegravir- vs. efavirenz-based ART. In addition, Dr. Lockman will also mentor junior investigators on projects nested within a new large randomized IMPAACT trial of 3 antiretroviral regimens in pregnancy that that she leads, and in prior large perinatal HIV studies in Botswana that enrolled more than 9,000 mother-infant pairs. This K24 is critical, to support the protected time and resources that are required for Dr. Lockman to mentor junior investigators from both the US and Botswana in patient-oriented research. NARRATIVE Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in global patient-oriented HIV research (many of whom have gone on to conduct funded research of their own), and is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. In this project, she will harness unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a randomized HIV prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000), in order to study questions of major public health importance in the new reality of universal antiretroviral treatment (regardless of HIV disease stage)--namely, whether it is feasible and acceptable to identify and offer proven HIV prevention interventions to HIV-negative persons at high risk for acquiring HIV; and what the longer-term health implications of HIV (and of universal treatment) are, for the health of HIV-infected and –uninfected people (including hypertension and cancer risk).",Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial,9644986,K24AI131928,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Botswana ', ' Bechuanaland ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Circumcision ', ' Male Circumcision ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epidemic ', ' Faculty ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Household ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Mothers ', ' Persons ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' virology ', ' Measures ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' cancer risk ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' efavirenz ', ' treatment program ', ' Prevention ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' emtricitabine ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' point of care ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' community intervention ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' high risk ', ' HIV prevention trial ', ' population based ', ' IMPAACT ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Regimen ', ' Secure ', ' Prevention trial ', ' trial design ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' perinatal HIV ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2019,188858,0.380206186955001
"Optimizing HIV Treatment Monitoring under Resource Constraints ?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With escalating global access to HIV antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, treatment failure is inevitable and must be anticipated. Correct and early diagnosis of treatment failure is essential for cost savings, durable response to therapy and prevention of morbidity and mortality. Most HIV treatment programs in the developing world either do not have access to viral load (VL) testing, the gold-standard treatment monitoring modality, or can apply it only on a limited basis. Other monitoring technologies such as drug resistance testing are even less common for financial and infrastructure constraints. In this proposal we will develop, evaluate and implement methods to optimize monitoring of ARV therapy in resource limited settings (RLS) that have diverse VL availability. Though several recent studies have proposed and evaluated lower-cost markers as VL surrogates and strategies for selective VL use, they generally are not based on a formal, decision theoretic framework that allows discovery of strategies with optimality properties that can be expressed in terms of misclassification rate, cost, and other clinically relevant parameters. We propose to develop the statistical framework, theory and methods required to discover optimal diagnostic algorithms for monitoring treatment failure with limited or no VL availability; to use cohort data from both the US and Kenya to derive, calibrate and cross-validate the algorithms; to use extant plasma samples from patients in a PEPFAR-funded HIV care program to design and cross-validate a new diagnostic algorithm that includes implementation of pooled assays; and to develop usable software that will enable programs to design their own protocols based on the characteristics of their patient population and local capacity for viral load testing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Effective use of antiretroviral therapy is critical for managing and preventing the spread of HIV in the developing world. This proposal develops methods that make optimal use of diagnostic tests having limited availability to monitor the effectiveness of therapy and to prompt a change in regimen when it is warranted. Successful implementation will improve patient outcomes and help to prevent the spread of treatment-resistant strains of HIV.",Optimizing HIV Treatment Monitoring under Resource Constraints,9593017,R01AI108441,"['Algorithms ', ' Archives ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Calibration ', ' Canada ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Markers ', ' Diagnosis ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' Europe ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Kenya ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' virology ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' therapy failure ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Side ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' cohort ', ' simulation ', ' treatment program ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Early identification ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' HIV therapy ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' resistant strain ', ' resistance strain ', ' Regimen ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' HIV antiretroviral ', ' HIV anti-retroviral ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIAID,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,663842,0.2509127164542943
"Big Data Analysis of HIV Risk and Epidemiology in Sub-Saharan Africa Project Summary/Abstract HIV is the largest single cause of death among adults in Sub-Saharan Africa, responsible for about a third of all deaths among adults. One of the key paradigms to halting HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa relies on identification of infected individuals and populations for delivery of biomedical and behavioral interventions. However, by the end of 2015 less that half of HIV-infected individuals accessed antiretroviral therapy (ART) despite expansion of eligibility and ongoing efforts to diagnose and initiate treatment. A better understanding of the social, behavioral, environmental, and economic contexts that influence HIV risk could improve the effectiveness and efficiency of programs that aim to identify and target HIV-infected populations. In response to the program announcement for “Harnessing Big Data to Halt HIV” (PA-15-273), the overall goal of this proposal is to develop new analytic tools in large-scale data to predict risk of HIV infection and to generate hypotheses about new or under-recognized risk factors in Sub-Saharan Africa. We plan four primary investigations: (1) Extract and harmonize all Sub- Saharan African nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys that include the HIV status of over 600,000 men and women collected in 29 countries, and hundreds to thousands of associated exposure variables; (2) Develop analytic tools based on LASSO and XWAS to predict HIV infection status and generate hypotheses about social, behaviorial, environmental, an economic risk factors; (3) Identify HIV risk in multi-country, large-scale data and synthesize findings across in Sub-Saharan Africa, and (4) develop a bioethics program to identify targets for new interventions and policies in a culturally and ethically sound manner. The project will develop leverage big data and high-throughput analytic methodology in the service of global HIV control. The outputs of this project include (1) accessible software code for efficient exploration of robust correlates of HIV status derived from the biggest collection of high-dimensional, harmonized, and nationally representative representative household surveys in the world, (2) an extensive landscape of the social, environmental, behavioral, and economic factors predictive of HIV infection among over 600K people tested for HIV in 29 Sub- Saharan countries, and (3) a ethical framework to enable practical, relevant, and appropriate translation and communication of findings. New models of HIV infection will facilitate identification of at-risk groups and the development of interventions to halt the HIV epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa. Project Narrative Advancing the the public health goals for global HIV, including the “AIDS-Free Generation” and “90-90- 90,” requires effective identification of HIV-infected individuals. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop new analytic tools to (1) predict HIV status using modern tools of statistical machine learning and (2) uncover new and under-recognized risk factors for HIV infection in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using person-level data including the HIV status of over 600,000 men and women collected in nationally representative household surveys from 29 countries, we propose to build a high-throughput statistical predictor of HIV status and apply a novel “X-wide association study” (XWAS) to search for and validate social, behavioral, environmental, and economic factors associated with HIV seropositivity. Through development of an ethical/decision making framework and with close consult of an advisory committee, the findings will be used to develop both broad and specific insights about risk factors and at-risk populations for improving HIV care and epidemiology.",Big Data Analysis of HIV Risk and Epidemiology in Sub-Saharan Africa,9657555,R01AI127250,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communication ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Analysis ', ' Demographic Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Goals ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Household ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Persons ', ' Program Efficiency ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' sound ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Privacy ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Demographic and Health Surveys ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Country ', ' Consult ', ' Services ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Bioethics Consultants ', ' Bioethicist ', ' Effectiveness ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' behavioral economics ', ' high dimensionality ', ' testing services ', ' treatment services ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' health goals ', ' ']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,683442,0.35691819003825265
"Characterizing proviral populations in brain tissues ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  This study is designed to meet the goals of the RFA-DA-15-018: Developing Technologies and Tools to Monitor HIV Brain Reservoirs and How They May be Altered by Exposure to Substances of Abuse. To meet this challenge in the R21 phase, we propose to develop and validate a combined next generation sequencing (Pacific Biosciences single-molecule, real time (SMRT) sequencing) and bioinformatics platform to accurately measure and characterize HIV DNA populations in brain and lymph node tissues. In particular, this platform will be able to measure and identify proviral populations that are (i) intact and replication competent, (ii) intact but replication incompetent, and (iii) not intact. We will develop and validate the proposed platform based on international standard procedures for diagnostic molecular methods (i.e. CAP and OIE) using brain and lymph node tissues from HIV-infected individuals on optimized antiretroviral therapy for at least 2 years before death. Once developed and validated, we will use this technology in the R33 phase to determine how HIV DNA populates the brains of stimulant users and non-users. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will develop and validate a next generation sequencing and bioinformatics platform that can quantify and sequence full-length HIV provirus in brain tissue to determine if the sampled HIV DNA populations are: (i) intact and replication competent, (ii) intact but replication incompetent, and (iii) not intact. Once optimized, we will determine how stimulant use is associated with how HIV DNA variants populate brain and lymph node tissues. 1",Characterizing proviral populations in brain tissues,9926483,R33DA041007,"['Affect ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Basal Ganglia ', ' Basal Nuclei ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Cocaine ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Dopamine ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' In Vitro ', ' lymph gland ', ' Lymph node proper ', ' Lymph Node Reticuloendothelial System ', ' lymph nodes ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' Methods ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Proviruses ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' Running ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' Secondary to ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Solid ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Training ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Nonsense Codon ', ' Premature Stop Codon ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Lymph Node Tissue ', ' Reaction ', ' brain tissue ', ' Viral ', ' internal control ', ' expression cloning ', ' white matter ', ' substantia alba ', ' Substance of Abuse ', ' substances of abuse ', ' Appearance ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Techniques ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Technics ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Methods ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Length ', ' International ', ' Interruption ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' open source ', ' public health relevance ', ' cocaine use ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' HIV Genome ', ' HIV1 genome ', ' HIV-1 genome ', ' methamphetamine use ', ' methamphetamine using ', ' METH using ', ' METH use ', ' viral rebound ', ' virus rebound ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' single molecule real time sequencing ', ' single molecule realtime sequencing ', ' SMRT-seq ', ' SMRT sequencing ', ' stimulant use ', ' ']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R33,2019,10174,0.24117470434993873
"Identification of Biomarkers of CNS injury and resilience related to HIV-1 and Methamphetamine PROJECT SUMMARY Methamphetamine (METH) is commonly abused and is a risk factor for HIV. METH also increases risk for adverse outcomes during HIV, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Multiple studies have demonstrated the neurotoxic effects of METH and HIV on brain structure and function, as well as neurobehavioral and functional performance. Biomarkers of central nervous system (CNS) injury and resilience would be valuable tools for understanding the METH- and HIV-associated pathogenesis and could provide valuable insights for drug development. The effects of METH and HIV outside the CNS (e.g., vascular and metabolic disease) are also important to consider and are a key gap in the field. Another key gap in the field is the translation of research findings to the clinic, including biomarkers that may be used to detect METH- and HIV-associated CNS injury and functional impairment across disease stages. Even less is known about biomarkers of resilience of the host defense mechanisms. Thus, in response to RFA-DA-18-023, this project proposes to screen a comprehensive panel of clinical and research biomarkers reflective of pathology and resilience with the goal of identifying and validating biosignatures that may improve the clinical assessment and diagnosis of brain and peripheral complications associated with METH and HIV. To accomplish this, we propose to leverage NIDA’s prior investment in UCSD’s NIDA-funded Translational Methamphetamine AIDS Research Center (TMARC), which performed standardized neurobehavioral, neuroimaging, and neuromedical assessments of participants who differed by METH use and HIV infection. We will recall and comprehensively re-assess 200 of these participants. Neuroimaging methods will include measures of cerebral blood flow, CNS metabolite levels, and a novel neuroimaging measure to estimate integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We will measure a comprehensive biomarker panel in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and stool samples, in specimens from their prior baseline visit, which are stored, and from their new visit and then analyze the data using traditional statistical approaches as well as novel techniques rooted in machine-learning and causal inference modeling. This approach will provide unique longitudinal data that will allow for the identification of biosignatures that predict changes in CNS injury and resilience. We will validate the observed biosignatures in an independent cohort of 100 participants who have been previously assessed at UCSD’s HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program and who have comprehensive data and stored specimens (e.g., CSF) available. To better respond to the clinical translation objective of the RFA, we will also compare measured biomarkers to data that are obtained during routine clinic assessments with the goal of identifying a clinical biosignature of METH- and HIV-related CNS injury. A thorough understanding of the impact of METH and HIV on systemic and CNS processes will address key gaps in the field. This insight should also inform the development of assays to inform diagnosis and effective disease and treatment monitoring.

"Role of cannabis on HIV-related cognitive impairment:  a brain connectomics study Project Summary  Despite widespread use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), nearly half of HIV+ Americans will experience HIV-related neurological comorbidities that negatively impact daily functioning and clinical outcomes. Alterations in brain structure and function are consistently linked to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), but the mechanisms through which HIV causes alterations in neural networks and associated cognitive function are not well characterized. Marijuana use, which is disproportionately prevalent among HIV+ persons, may increase the risk of HAND. Our preliminary work suggests that co-occurring marijuana use and HIV infection intensifies dysfunction in major neural networks, including white matter abnormalities and decoupling of functional activation patterns. Capitalizing on a strong foundation of neurobehavioral research on drug addiction and HIV/AIDS by our multidisciplinary team, the proposed research will apply connectomic analyses to achieve the following aims: (1) examine the independent and interactive effects of HIV and marijuana on structural and functional organization of the brain; (2) investigate the longitudinal relationship between network-level disruptions in brain organization and cognitive impairment; and (3) use machine deep learning algorithms to develop individualized prediction models for HAND diagnosis and severity based on multimodal graph features. Using a cross-lagged panel design, 200 adults stratified by HIV and marijuana status (4 groups) will have multimodal MRIs and cognitive testing at baseline and 1 year later. The central hypothesis is that marijuana use will exacerbate structural and functional disruptions in brain organization that underlie the expression and progression of HAND. Our proposal responds directly to RFA-18- 610, which highlights the need for studies on “the underlying mechanisms whereby drugs of abuse and HIV infection interact to impair CNS functions mediated through altered neuronal networks.” This research uses a team science approach to address high priority topics for AIDS-designated funding, including neurological complications [NOT-15-137]. Building upon a sound premise and robust preliminary data, this innovative project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers that may aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of HAND in persons with chronic substance use disorders and serve as targets for novel clinical interventions. In addition, our classification models are expected to provide a generalizable framework applicable to individual patients for tailoring of treatment approaches. Public Health Relevance  Of the 1.1 million Americans living with HIV/AIDS, nearly half will experience HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders that impact daily functioning. Marijuana, the mostly commonly abused drug among HIV-infected persons, may accelerate the development and progression of neurocognitive impairments. This study applies a connectomics approach to examine how HIV and marijuana interact to disrupt neural networks that underlie cognitive functioning, with implications for the development of improved diagnostics and treatments.",Role of cannabis on HIV-related cognitive impairment:  a brain connectomics study,9739366,R01DA047149,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic

"Personalized strategies for HIV treatment maintenance: an application of novel machine learning methods to HIV care in East Africa PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: Despite the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy (ART), public health efforts to treat persons living with HIV must address issues with patient retention in order to achieve lasting epidemic control. People living in African countries with high rates of HIV infection face different barriers to retention, including structural barriers (e.g. transport to clinic), psychosocial barriers (e.g., stigma), and others (e.g., long waiting times). This diversity of barriers contains a critical implication: no single behavioral intervention will help all patients remain in care. Given the absence of a “one-size-fits-all” solution to HIV treatment maintenance, Drs. Petersen and Geng (the current project's sponsors) co-lead a nearly completed NIH-funded trial (ADAPT-R; NCT02338739) that identifies adaptive strategies for patient retention. In ADAPT-R, HIV-positive patients initiating ART are randomized to a low-intensity intervention to prevent retention lapses. Patients are re-randomized to a high-intensity intervention to facilitate their return to care, only if initial retention is poor. By responding to a single aspect of individual patient behavior (days in treatment), this adaptive strategy is actually more efficient (patients succeeding avoid more costly interventions) and effective (patients not well-retained receive more intensive support) than intervention assignment strategies in traditional trials that assume “one size fits all.” Approach: The current proposal uses recent advances in statistics, machine learning, and causal inference to develop an analysis plan that not only leverages, but also innovates, the parent trial. This project proposes to use ADAPT-R data to design algorithms that assign each patient his/her personalized interventions based on patient characteristics measured at baseline (e.g., demographics, distance from clinic, stigma) and over time (e.g., lapses in care, updated clinical data measures, past interventions). By making optimal use of all patient characteristics measured in ADAPT-R (i.e., not just early lapses in care) to assign interventions, it is hypothesized that these algorithms will be most efficient and effective at retaining patients, compared to assignment methods used in ADAPT-R and “one-size- fits-all” traditional trials. Specific Aims: This F31 Diversity grant aims to: 1) design and test an algorithm that assigns each patient a personalized low-intensity intervention for remaining in HIV care; 2) design and test an algorithm that assigns each patient a personalized low- and high-intensity intervention, in sequence, for remaining in HIV care. Impact: This project provides an opportunity to learn more effective ways of administering existing interventions to improve HIV retention in rural Africa. At the broadest level, this work aims to advance the toolkit for developing Precision Public Health strategies. Fellowship information: This project is the dissertation of Ms. Lina Montoya, a PhD student in Biostatistics at University of California, Berkeley. Ms. Montoya has chosen one primary sponsor and two co-sponsors with complementary expertise and collaboration in the fields of statistics, HIV, global health and implementation science. Her training will consist of 2 years of research, coursework, and professional development. PROJECT NARRATIVE HIV-positive patients in sub-Saharan Africa face diverse barriers to receiving treatment; thus, there does not exist a “one-size-fits-all” behavioral intervention to help patients remain in care.

"Optimizing outcomes at the intersection of HIV and mental health: Prediction, precision medicine, and population health PROJECT SUMMARY  Psychiatric disorders and substance misuse are prevalent among people with HIV (PWH) and have negative effects on HIV control. These conditions impose substantial emotional and physical burdens, impede the achievement of virologic suppression, and are associated with behaviors that increase the risk of transmission. While it is common for PWH to have multiple psychiatric diagnoses, relatively little is known about the ways in which combinations of psychiatric symptoms and substance misuse behaviors confer elevated risk for poor HIV control, or how to personalize the management of these commonly co-occurring disorders. Furthermore, estimates of the potential public-health impact of mental health service innovations on the HIV epidemic are generally lacking. Recent innovations in statistics and machine learning make it possible to harness complex data to identify patterns of psychiatric disease in PWH and tailor psychiatric therapy to optimize HIV control in ways that classical statistical approaches cannot.  The candidate is a translational and computational investigator and general internal medicine physician at Johns Hopkins University with a background in computer science and biostatistics. During this award period, he will be mentored by a team whose expertise spans HIV care, psychiatric epidemiology, machine learning, population-level HIV modeling, and personalized medicine. The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent, translational researcher who applies innovative statistical and machine learning approaches to improve the health of individuals and populations at the intersection of HIV and mental health.  The overarching objective for this project is to address psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in the context of the HIV continuum of care by developing models that leverage complex data to inform patient care and public policy. Three aims will be undertaken: (1) to identify how combinations of symptoms of depression and anxiety and misuse of alcohol, cocaine, opioids, marijuana, and amphetamines impact individual-level HIV control; (2) to use repeated patient-reported measures of depression, anxiety, and substance misuse to predict future mental health and HIV control under a potential pharmacotherapies; and (3) to develop population models that project the impact of mental health service interventions on HIV incidence and mortality. The models will leverage data from the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS), a racially diverse, multi-site cohort of over 31,000 PWH.  This mentored research will be accompanied by relevant skills training in mental health epidemiology, the care of PWH, and advanced Bayesian and machine-learning methods. Collectively, this research and career development training will provide a clear pathway to an independent career as a clinical investigator focused on optimizing the management of psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in PWH at both the individual and population level. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric comorbidities and substance misuse present major obstacles for many persons with HIV in achieving virologic suppression, with negative consequences for both individual and population health. I propose to address psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in the context of the HIV continuum of care by developing innovative models that leverage complex patient data (1) to guide the care of individual persons with HIV and mental illness and (2) to inform policy decisions about systems-level interventions in mental health. As part of a mentored research training program, this award will allow me to become a leading independent researcher with the expertise to leverage complex individual- and population-level data to optimize the health of individuals and populations with HIV who suffer from mental illness.","Optimizing outcomes at the intersection of HIV and mental health: Prediction, precision medicine, and

"Prediction of heart failure in HIV-infected individuals 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Half of those living with HIV in the U.S. are or will soon be >50 years of age. Heart failure, which has one of the highest disease burdens of any age-related condition nationwide, may soon become the most costly HIV- related comorbidity in terms of premature mortality, suffering, and healthcare expenditures. Many of its known risk factors are common to HIV-infected and uninfected individuals alike, but less is known about its pathogenesis in the context of suppressive HIV therapy. New evidence suggests that long-term survival with HIV is associated with greater risks for systolic and diastolic dysfunction as well as resultant heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Against a background of high diabetes, hypertension, and obesity risk in minority groups affected disproportionately by HIV, a unique set of etiologic and prognostic factors for heart failure in the context of HIV infection likely exists. The proposed research is a set of epidemiologic studies characterizing the role of HIV infection in heart failure incidence and survival, based on data from the largest HIV care provider in the Bronx, NY. Aim 1 will assess the association between HIV infection and heart failure incidence, and Aim 1b will identify risk factors, including major comorbidities, that may lead to greater mortality in optimally treated HIV-infected heart failure patients compared with HIV-uninfected heart failure patients. Aims 2 and 3 will implement machine learning methods within our longitudinal electronic medical record database to construct prediction models identifying HIV+ patients at greatest risk of developing HF, and to identify unique HIV-specific phenotypes of HFpEF and HFrEF. Prediction models developed in our clinical population (90% minority, 40% female) will be validated in a demographically complementary HIV+ cohort in Chicago (50% minority, 15% female) to evaluate the transportability of these models across patient populations. This award will provide ample training opportunities for the candidate to continue his progression to an independent academic research career with specialized experience at the intersection of HIV, cardiovascular disease, and medical informatics. Established institutional resources and a mentoring team with a proven record of success, as well as research conducted within a geographic area with endemic levels of HIV and heart disease, provide an ideal setting to successfully produce high quality research with major impact. The collaboration will establish a program for large-scale translational research in HIV and heart failure by developing a shared research platform between two major research institutions in the Bronx and Chicago. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heart failure imposes one of the highest disease burdens of any condition in the U.S., with over 6 million Americans affected, and costs reaching $34 billion annually. The extent to which it affects people living with HIV is currently unclear but of critical importance, due to the aging of the population as a result of successful antiretroviral therapy. Our work will allow for the prediction of heart failure risk in people living with HIV and identify unique heart failure phenotypes in the context of HIV infection, both of which may help to tailor prevention and treatment efforts in the future in this vulnerable population.",Prediction of heart failure in HIV-infected individuals,9858825,K01HL137557,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', '

"uTECH: Machine Learning for HIV Prevention Among Substance Using GBMSM Project Summary Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are disproportionately impacted by HIV in the U.S. Substance use is an important influence on HIV risk among GBMSM; and partner seeking for both sex and substance use have largely moved online and to geosocial networking platforms designed for GBMSM (e.g., Grindr). Technological advances in the collection and mining of “big data” to inform behavioral health interventions have increased in recent years but have not been applied directly to HIV prevention and substance use harm reduction among GBMSM. At the same time, despite major advances in biomedical HIV prevention (i.e., pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) and substance use harm-reduction (i.e., medication assisted therapy [MAT]), these strategies are underutilized by GBMSM. My research team and I conducted formative research on social media data mining and machine learning through a NIDA A/START (R03) to identify patterns of technology use that are associated with HIV risk and substance use among GBMSM. We established computational functionality of a culturally tailored social media data mining program among substance using GBMSM. I now take an important scientific risk to use this technology to develop an HIV prevention intervention for GBMSM, tentatively titled uTECH, that leverages insights from machine learning to trigger personalized intervention content in order to increase biomedical HIV prevention and substance use harm reduction. Specifically, I propose to conduct a two-phase study. In Phase 1 I will conduct qualitative interviews with GBMSM to inform the iterative development and refinement of uTECH. In Phase 2, I will test the acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of uTECH in a comparative implementation science trial. For this phase, I will (a) enroll racially diverse, HIV-negative, substance using GBMSM; (b) randomize them to either the uTECH intervention or a comparison group; and (c) measure acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility through 6 months post-intervention. My primary implementation science outcomes will be acceptability (i.e., Acceptability of Intervention Measure [AIM]), appropriateness (i.e., Intervention Appropriateness Measure [IAM]), and feasibility (i.e., Feasibility of Intervention Measure [FIM]). I believe that the power of “big data” and new technologies can be harnessed for effective HIV prevention with substance using GBMSM. In the era of increasing HIV prevention fatigue among GBMSM, the ability to deliver quick, convenient and highly personalized interventions presents an opportunity to reinvigorate HIV prevention. Project Narrative Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are the largest HIV transmission group in the U.S. and substance use is an important factor driving new HIV infections in this population. The overarching goal of this proposal is to reinvigorate HIV prevention among GBMSM by refining and testing the acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of an innovative, social media “big data” machine learning intervention, which aims to reduce HIV transmission risk by integrating biomedical and behavioral risk reduction strategies.",uTECH: Machine Learning for HIV Prevention Among Substance Using GBMSM,9822931,DP2DA049296,"['Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' Interview ', ' Mining ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Phase ', ' insight ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Gays ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' HIV risk ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' comparison group ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' comparative ', ' implementation science ', ' Big Data ', ' BigData ', ' behavioral health intervention ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' social media ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,DP2,2019,2340000,0.25164092001768595
"Long Acting Film Technology for Contraception and HIV Prevention (LATCH) PROJECT ABSTRACT Several studies (ASPIRE, VOICE) have shown that adherence is paramount to the success of HIV prevention methods in women. Providing women with options through alternative drug delivery technologies can positively impact adherence. A compelling strategy includes co-delivery of an anti-HIV agent with a contraceptive agent to prevent pregnancy. This proposal plans to develop a next generation multipurpose prevention technology (MPT) film platform for once a month intravaginal administration of the 4'-Ethynyl-2-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine (EFdA) prodrug (EFdA-P) and a progestin (levonorgestrel (LNG) or etonogestrel (ENG)) to achieve the dual goal of preventing HIV infection and pregnancy. EFdA-P showed increased bioavailability and tissue permeability compared to the parent EFdA, a highly potent exciting new antiviral drug. This versatile extended release MPT film platform is intended to provide a discrete, low cost and convenient alternative to women at high risk of HIV infection and unintended pregnancy. Recent data from our lab shows that films can deliver an anti-HIV agent in the vagina for up to 1 month even in the context of menses and sexual intercourse. Using this knowledge and our expertise in the development of intravaginal films, this proposal will develop a film platform for co-delivery of a progestin (licensed contraceptive agent) and EFdA-P at a predetermined rate for at least 1 month. MPT films containing EFdA will also be generated for comparison. The R61 phase of this milestone driven proposal will generate critical preformulation data for EFdA/EFdA-P and LNG/ENG drug combinations and optimize the MPT film formulation to achieve one- month delivery of both drugs with desired short-term stability. This phase will also establish the compatibility of film prototype with vaginal tissue and microbial flora in vitro followed by vaginal retention studies in the non- human primate (NHP) model. The R61 phase will demonstrate the ability of the MPT film prototype to attain desired release profiles of both drugs in vivo (NHP model). Using a clearly defined go / no go criteria, a lead MPT film will be transitioned to the R33 phase. The R33 phase will involve IND-enabling activities including drug- drug interaction, in vitro transporter and metabolism studies, manufacturing scale up and establishing long-term stability of the lead MPT film. It will also demonstrate the safety (rat, rabbit, and NHP) and efficacy of the lead MPT film against SHIV infection in NHP model. It will also confirm the ability of the film to function in the context of sexual activity and its ability to deliver contraceptive levels of progestin in the NHP model. The successful completion of proposed work will generate a novel extended release MPT film platform that can be applied to other drug combinations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The adherence of women to anti-HIV and contraceptives can be improved by providing convenient low-cost alternative product options. This project will develop novel extended release vaginal films that co-deliver anti- HIV and contraceptive agents for one month upon single intravaginal administration.",Long Acting Film Technology

"The Impact of Cocaine Abstinence or Reduced Use on Radiomic Features of Noncalcified Coronary Plaques in HIV-Infected Cocaine Users with Silent Coronary Artery Disease ABSTRACT Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART), individuals living with HIV experience an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Although increased arterial inflammation on 18F-FDG-PET was shown to be associated with high risk plaque features (HRPFs) in those with HIV and subclinical atherosclerosis, there is no evidence of increased arterial inflammation in optimally treated HIV-infected adults with full viral suppression, low cardiovascular risk and no known CAD when the imaging results are compared to those from HIV- uninfected controls. These findings suggest that HIV-associated atherosclerosis may be triggered by factors other than HIV-associated inflammation such as traditional cardiovascular risk factors or cocaine use. Other evidence indicates that cocaine is associated with coronary atherosclerosis. It was also shown that cocaine use modifies the effect of HIV on subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. Supported by DA035632, this research team enrolled 102 daily cocaine users (including 84 HIV-infected) with contrast-enhanced coronary CT angiography (CCTA)-confirmed significant (>50% in diameter) coronary stenosis, and employed a cash- incentive approach to systematically reinforce cocaine abstinence. The study demonstrated that continued cocaine use led to coronary plaque volume progression, while abstinent or reduced cocaine use led to plaque volume regression. However, whether cocaine use influences plaque characteristics in HIV-infected cocaine users has not been investigated. Plaque characteristics are important because rupture-prone coronary plaques might not necessarily be only those, which cause obstructive stenosis, and that HRPFs are independent of the severity of coronary artery luminal stenosis. However, identification of the strongest predictor of CAD among four HRPFs, the napkin-ring sign (NRS), at present, is based only on expert subjective opinion. A landmark cardiovascular radiomics study calculated 4,440 radiomic features for each coronary plaque and identified a subset of these parameters which predicted NRS, a qualitative feature of prognostic imaging marker of acute coronary syndrome. It is quite possible that with the cardiac radiomic approach, the association between cocaine use and this critical biomarker will be further clarified. The objective of the proposed study is to examine whether cocaine use influences plaque features in HIV-infected cocaine users. The proposed study will perform radiomic analyses on the imaging data from 102 participants on DA035632. The specific aims of this study are: (1) To examine whether continued cocaine use is associated with the NRS and its associated radiomic features in HIV-infected cocaine users with significant coronary plaques, (2) To examine whether abstinent or reduced cocaine use ameliorated NRS and its associated radiomic features in HIV-infected cocaine users with significant coronary plaques, (3) To compare NRS and its associated radiomic features between HIV infected and uninfected participants, and (4) To validate the findings generated from this study.

"Forecasting trajectories of HIV transmission networks with a novel phylodynamic and deep learning framework SUMMARY Despite the advent of combined antiretroviral therapy, the ongoing HIV epidemic still defies prevention and intervention strategies designed to reduce significantly both prevalence and incidence worldwide. In order to achieve the 2020 UNAIDS 90-90-90 goal (90% of people living with HIV diagnosed, 90% of people diagnosed to be on sustained antiretroviral treatment, and 90% of people on treatment to maintain viral suppression), it is necessary to develop innovative tools that can be used for predicting the growth and trajectory of localized sub-epidemics driven by specific transmission clusters. Phylodynamic analysis has extensively been used in the HIV field to track the origin and reconstruct the virus demographic history both at local, regional and global level. However, such studies have been so far only retrospective, with little or no power to make predictions about future epidemic trends. The overarching goal of the prosed project is to develop an innovative computational framework coupling phylodynamic inference and behavioral network data with artificial intelligence algorithms capable of predicting HIV transmission clusters future trajectory, and informing on key determinants of new infections. We propose to achieve this goal by carrying out three specific aims: 1. Develop a phylodynamic-based PRIDE module to forecast HIV infection hotspots [the infected]; 2. Develop a behavioral network-based PRIDE module for risk of HIV infection [the uninfected], and 3. Carry out focus groups for deploying the new PRIDE forecasting technology into public health, and implement prevention through the peer change agent model. In particular, through a close partnership with the Florida Department of Health (FLDoH), we will analyze existing databases that the FLDoH has assembled over the past twelve years including extensive HIV molecular sequence, clinical and behavioral network data. Florida had an HIV case rate of 24.0 per 100,000 people in 2016, and it is currently the third state in the USA in terms of yearly incidence. Our partnership with the FLDoH will ensure that the results of the proposed research will be used to curtail the HIV epidemic by optimizing public health based surveillance programs, informing targeted intervention strategies, and implementing more effective prevention measures. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE / PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the advent of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), the ongoing HIV epidemic still defies prevention strategies designed to reduce significantly incidence worldwide.

"The Role of an Artificially Intelligent Chatbot in Social Support, Antiretroviral Adherence, and Depressive Symptoms among Young Adults Living with HIV in South Africa PROJECT SUMMARY Specific Aims: Developing effective interventions to reduce disparities in treatment outcomes among populations disproportionately affected by HIV is a priority for NIH-funded HIV research in 2019. This study will explore the effects and uptake of an artificially intelligent, socially supportive chatbot – a computer that texts with users via mobile phone – among young women and men who have sex with men (YMSM) living with HIV in South Africa. Specifically, the study will (1) develop an online scale to measure social support from a chatbot among young adults; (2) evaluate associations of social support from a chatbot with changes in depressive symptoms and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among young women and YMSM in South Africa; and (3) describe barriers and facilitators to uptake of a chatbot among young women and YMSM in South Africa. Significance: Young South Africans between the ages of 15 to 24 are at high risk of contracting and dying from HIV. Though ART extends life and prevents transmission, many young adults have poor adherence. Research in high-income countries suggest that automated two-way messaging with chatbots improves adherence to health behaviors. Chatbots may also address depressive symptoms and lack of social support, which are consistently identified barriers to adherence. Chatbots are rarely used to improve HIV care in low- and middle-income countries. If this study’s aims are achieved, then (1) future researchers will be able to more accurately measure social support from chatbots; (2) chatbots could potentially be used to promote adherence to medications and increase access to mental health support; and (3) future design and implementation of chatbots to improve HIV care will be optimized. This study’s long-term objective is to generate evidence for an effective, scalable intervention that engages hard-to-reach populations living with HIV. Approach: Aim 1 will develop a scale to measure social support from a chatbot using principal components and exploratory factor analyses applied to data gathered from 1,200 young adults worldwide who use Replika, a freely available mobile application (app). Aims 2 and 3 will invite 160 young women and YMSM living with HIV in Cape Town, South Africa to use the Replika app for four weeks in a pre-post study design. Aim 2 will employ an analysis of covariance using generalized multivariable linear regression models to assess the relationship between feelings of social support from the Replika app and changes in depressive symptoms and ART adherence. Aim 3 will leverage surveys (quantitative) and interviews (qualitative) in a mixed methods study to characterize differences between users with high- and low-frequency engagement with the app. Fellowship Information: This study is the dissertation for Ms. Brooke Jarrett, a PhD student in the Department of Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University. Her training will consist of research methods and science communication toward her career goal of becoming a researcher of state-of-the-art mobile technologies to improve the physical and mental health of young people affected by health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Though medications for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can greatly increase life expectancy and prevent new HIV infections, many young adults living with HIV do not adhere to their prescribed daily regimen of medications. Artificially intelligent chatbots – or a computer that texts back-and-forth with users – may be able to promote adherence to health behaviors. This study will explore whether and how chatbots can provide social support, alleviate depressive symptoms, and improve medication adherence among young women and men who have sex with men living with HIV in South Africa.","The Role of an Artificially Intelligent Chatbot in Social Support, Antiretroviral Adherence, and Depressive Symptoms among Young Adults Living with HIV in South Africa",9925884,F31MH121128,"['Affect ', ' Southern Africa ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' E-Mail ', ' Email ', ' electronic communication ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Fellowship ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Happiness ', ' positive attitude ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Interview ', ' Judgment ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' South Africa ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' computer human interaction ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' social norm ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Life ', ' posters ', ' Principal Component Analyses ', ' Principal Component Analysis ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Viral ', ' interest ', ' innovative technologies ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' antiretroviral ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' therapy adherence ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' Regimen ', ' adolescent woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' young woman ', ' Ph D student ', ' Ph D. student ', ' Ph.

"Defining the impact of injection drug use on antiretroviral therapy and HIV treatment outcomes: an (epi)genomic approach Although uptake of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in people who inject drugs (PWID) infected with HIV has increased dramatically in the past decade, poor health outcomes including non-AIDS-related comorbidity and mortality in HIV-infected PWID on cART remains a significant public health problem. A crucial knowledge gap is a lack of the understanding about how injection drug use (IDU) impacts the course of HIV disease. Differences in gene regulation affected by IDU and non-adherence to cART are likely to affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these treatments that may result in poor outcomes. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify genomic signatures for PWID and to link PWID-associated genomic signals to HIV outcomes in the context of cART exposure (i.e., levels in plasma). Our overall hypothesis is that PWID accrue DNA methylation (DNAm) and transcriptome variations that impact on health outcomes, and which may be explained in part by variability in cART exposure. This hypothesis is built on our previous findings showing that IDU significantly altered the blood DNA methylome in HIV-infected individuals. Furthermore, DNAm signatures associated with IDU differentiated less and greater HIV disease frailty. To test this hypothesis, our approach will first perform epigenome-wide DNAm association analysis and transcriptome-wide association analysis in HIV-infected PWID as compared to HIV-infected non-PWID who are treated with cART in two independent cohorts. Second, we will test the relationship between PWID-associated differentially methylated positions (DMP) or regions (DMR) and differential gene expression (DGE) on cART variability in plasma and also their relationships with HIV frailty and mortality. Last, we propose to integrate genetic variation (single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP]), DNAm, and gene expression that differs by HIV-infected PWID/non-PWID status. Our goal is to identify DMP or DMR and DGE between HIV-infected PWID and non-PWID in the context of cART and to apply epigenetic and transcriptomic signatures as biomarkers to predict HIV frailty and mortality. The application proposes the first integrative pharmacogenomic approach of genetic variants, epigenomic and transcriptomic associations for HIV-infected PWID in the context of cART. We expect to identify PWID- associated genes that can predict HIV cART treatment outcomes. The predictive model resulting from this project can inform biomarker identification for HIV outcomes. The proposal is the first step towards the understanding of pharmacogenomics and pharamcoepigenomics in PWID with HIV infection. The results will fill the knowledge gap of the biological basis of IDU effects on HIV outcomes and provide evidence to prioritize genes for future research of their functions in HIV progression. People who inject drug use infected with HIV have high medical comorbidity and poor health outcomes despite the availability of combination anti-retroviral therapy. Our integrative pharmacogenomic approach aims to define a set of genes associated with HIV-infected injection drug use and anti-retroviral therapy that predict HIV outcomes. Our work will generate not only knowledge about how injection drug use perturbs the HIV- infected host epigenome and transcriptome, but also potential biomarkers to predict individual HIV outcomes in the context of combination antiretroviral therapy.",Defining the impact of injection drug use on antiretroviral therapy and HIV treatment outcomes: an (epi)genomic approach,9976483,R01DA047063,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' indexing ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Public Health ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' uptake ', ' gene function ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' frailty ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' PWID ', ' people who inject drugs ', ' people who inject illicit drugs ', ' persons who inject drugs ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' cohort ', ' intravenous drug use ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Data ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict treatment response ', ' therapy prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Gene Combinations ', ' Differential Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Gene Expression ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' epigenomics ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' transcriptomics ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' nondrug ', ' non-drug ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' injection drug use ', ' methylome ', ' epigenome ', ' genetic strategy ', ' genetic approach ', ' genomic effort ', ' genomic strategy ', ' Genomic approach ', ' differentially expressed ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differential expression ', ' BeadChip ', ' bead chip ', ' potential biological marker ', ' potential biomarker ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' EWAS ', ' epigenome wide association analysis ', ' epigenome-wide association studies ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' marker identification ', ' biomarker identification ', ' genomic classifier ', ' genomic signature ', ' Women’s Interagency HIV Study ', ' PK/PD ', ' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,517732,0.34826530267261024
"Role of cannabis on HIV-related cognitive impairment:  a brain connectomics study Project Summary  Despite widespread use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), nearly half of HIV+ Americans will experience HIV-related neurological comorbidities that negatively impact daily functioning and clinical outcomes. Alterations in brain structure and function are consistently linked to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), but the mechanisms through which HIV causes alterations in neural networks and associated cognitive function are not well characterized. Marijuana use, which is disproportionately prevalent among HIV+ persons, may increase the risk of HAND. Our preliminary work suggests that co-occurring marijuana use and HIV infection intensifies dysfunction in major neural networks, including white matter abnormalities and decoupling of functional activation patterns. Capitalizing on a strong foundation of neurobehavioral research on drug addiction and HIV/AIDS by our multidisciplinary team, the proposed research will apply connectomic analyses to achieve the following aims: (1) examine the independent and interactive effects of HIV and marijuana on structural and functional organization of the brain; (2) investigate the longitudinal relationship between network-level disruptions in brain organization and cognitive impairment; and (3) use machine deep learning algorithms to develop individualized prediction models for HAND diagnosis and severity based on multimodal graph features. Using a cross-lagged panel design, 200 adults stratified by HIV and marijuana status (4 groups) will have multimodal MRIs and cognitive testing at baseline and 1 year later. The central hypothesis is that marijuana use will exacerbate structural and functional disruptions in brain organization that underlie the expression and progression of HAND. Our proposal responds directly to RFA-18- 610, which highlights the need for studies on “the underlying mechanisms whereby drugs of abuse and HIV infection interact to impair CNS functions mediated through altered neuronal networks.” This research uses a team science approach to address high priority topics for AIDS-designated funding, including neurological complications [NOT-15-137]. Building upon a sound premise and robust preliminary data, this innovative project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers that may aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of HAND in persons with chronic substance use disorders and serve as targets for novel clinical interventions. In addition, our classification models are expected to provide a generalizable framework applicable to individual patients for tailoring of treatment approaches. Public Health Relevance  Of the 1.1 million Americans living with HIV/AIDS, nearly half will experience HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders that impact daily functioning. Marijuana, the mostly commonly abused drug among HIV-infected persons, may accelerate the development and progression of neurocognitive impairments. This study applies a connectomics approach to examine how HIV and marijuana interact to disrupt neural networks that underlie cognitive functioning, with implications for the development of improved diagnostics and treatments.",Role of cannabis on HIV-related cognitive impairment:  a brain connectomics study,9903280,R01DA047149,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune

"Reconstructing HIV Epidemics from HIV Phylogenetics Project Summary HIV continues to spread, episodically, among minority groups, and mostly from people unaware of their infection. To more efficiently locate undiagnosed people living with HIV for treatment, as well as to monitor prevention efforts, better epidemiological techniques are needed. Our project brings together a team of experienced researchers from clinical, molecular biology, epidemiological, mathematical, and evolutionary fields. We will develop innovative epidemiological methods by combining evolutionary theory, multi-scale dynamic modeling, artificial intelligence, and large-scale clinical and sequence data. In this renewal, we will expand on our previous work on how HIV within-host evolutionary processes interact with epidemiological dynamics. Having quantified the link between transmission history and the resulting HIV phylogeny among hosts, we conceptualize the relationship between the evolution and epidemiology of HIV into three levels: within-host, at transmission, and on the population epidemic level. Because essential processes of HIV biology and evolution have been largely ignored when modeling the epidemic level, in aim 1 we examine within-host processes that affect diversification. We will include recombination, selection, and latency in a new coalescent within-host model to evaluate the impact on the epidemiological level. We will also quantify potential within- host multi-directional selection pressures. In aim 2, we focus on mechanisms that occur around the time of transmission. We will develop a new maximum likelihood method based on a forward-time probabilistic model of transmission that improves the inference of transmission direction and time of transmission among multiple hosts, and develop a transmission heterogeneity detection method to both assess overall possible transmission heterogeneity among infected persons, as well as to detect where in a phylogeny super- spreading may have occurred. In aim 3, we will develop machine learning methods to handle very large data sets (103-106 patients), and use additional clinical and demographic data to augment phylogenies in order to reconstruct the underlying transmission history.

"Developing an artificial intelligence-based mHealth intervention to increase HIV testing in Malaysia Project Summary  HIV testing jumpstarts entry into the HIV prevention and treatment cascade. HIV testing levels, however, are especially low in men who have sex with men (MSM), who increasingly contribute to heightened HIV transmission in the presence of high levels of stigma and discrimination. For high risk MSM, new guidelines recommend frequent HIV testing, ranging from every 3 to 6 months. Yet, HIV testing in MSM often occurs less frequently due to individual (e.g., heightened concerns about risk disclosure), clinic (e.g., confidentiality breaches, and discrimination from healthcare providers) and policy (criminalization of same-sex sexual behaviors) barriers. HIV prevalence in MSM in Malaysia has soared to 21.6% nationally, exceeding 40.9% in Kuala Lumpur. While surveillance surveys of MSM in Malaysia who meet criteria for PrEP suggest that ever tested is 70.3%, past- year tested is 40.9%, and only 9.5% were tested more than 1 time per year, despite extraordinary levels of self- reported risk. Once tested, however, MSM with HIV in Malaysia are likely to be treated with ART and achieve viral suppression, making HIV testing a central focus for HIV prevention and treatment.  Innovative strategies that motivate and provide guidance for testing among MSM in Malaysia are therefore urgently needed. Intervening using Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IBM) model is ideally suited to overcome barriers to recommended HIV testing in MSM. Moreover, in settings like Malaysia where the HIV epidemic has transitioned from primarily concentrated in PWID to a volatile epidemic in MSM, theory-guided behavioral change strategies that inform, motivate and provide pragmatic skills to more fully engage in recommended HIV testing are poised to accelerate the HIV prevention and care continuum. Given that there are many individual, clinic and policy barriers to HIV testing, mobile health (mHealth) interventions that reduce “in person” contact and offer a menu of behavioral skills is ideally suited to increase access to MSM in highly stigmatized settings and promote recommended HIV testing. Recent studies in the U.S., China, South Africa, and Peru show that mHealth interventions using smartphones and apps have the potential to increase HIV testing while maintaining MSM’s confidentiality. Such mHealth interventions are feasible and acceptable among MSM, including in Malaysia where most MSM find sexual partners using social-networking apps with similar interfaces and functionalities to the proposed intervention. Current mHealth strategies, however, are limited by their lack of automation and need for high-intensity and sustained human inputs, which restricts their scale-up. Artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning (ML) may overcome such limitations, but has yet to be applied to mHealth-based HIV testing algorithms. We therefore aim to develop and pilot test an AI-chatbot (R21 phase). Findings from the R21 phase will inform a Type 1 Hybrid Implementation Science trial (R33 phase) to evaluate the efficacy and implementation outcomes of the AI-chatbot for HIV testing relative to treatment as usual. Project Narrative The proposed research will focus on developing a chatbot that using artificial intelligence to promote HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (My). Once developed and adequately tested, the new chatbot (named MyTestBot) will be embedded into a social networking app selected by MSM to create an mHealth intervention to provide MSM with real-time HIV testing-related information, motivation, and behavioral skills. MyTestBot will provide culturally tailored messages to promote HIV testing in MSM that does not rely on intensive human resources to develop and maintain.",Developing an artificial intelligence-based

"A Big Data Approach to Identify Epigenetic, Transcriptomic, and Network Dynamics as Immune Dysfunction Drivers Associated with HIV Infection and Substance Use Disorder PROJECT ABSTRACT  The opioid crisis was declared a public health emergency in 2017. It has led to an increased incidence of opioid overdose, injection substance use, and, eventually, HIV transmission. More than 171,000 people in the United States are living with HIV as a result of substance use disorder (SUD). Despite the known fact that both HIV and SUD significantly disturbs both innate immunity and adaptive immunity, their underlying molecular mechanisms, and interplay to immune dysfunction remain unexplored. Comprehensive functional characterization at a single-cell resolution is essential to provide new molecular insights and discover therapeutic targets.  Recent advances in novel sequencing technologies and community efforts to share genomic data provide unprecedented opportunities to understand the molecular dynamics of immune dysfunction up HIV infection and SUD. This application describes the development of integrative strategies and machine learning methods to combine novel assays (such as STARR- seq) with high-dimensional, multi-scale genomic profiles to elucidate the transcriptional, epigenetic, and network alterations and to key immune dysfunction drivers associated with HIV and SUD. Specifically, we will (1) Integrate novel functional genomics assays with single-cell multi-omics data to construct cell-type-specific multi-modal gene regulatory network (GRNs) in healthy individuals, (2) build a comprehensive immune profiling data hub for HIV/SUD-affected individuals and construct disease- and cell-type-specific GRNs, (3) uncover how key network changes and aberrant behaviors of TFs upon HIV infection and/or SUD can lead to immune dysfunction. Distinct from existing efforts focusing on transcriptome analyses, this proposed work presents a genuinely novel big-data approach for both modeling gene regulation and investigating disease-risk factors by incorporating heterogeneous multi-omics profiles at a single-cell resolution. The resultant comprehensive list of cis-regulatory elements at a single-cell resolution will expand the number of known functional regions. The constructed immune cell atlas, GRNs, and identify key drivers of immune dysfunction will be accessible to the public via web services and annotation databases. Our integrative computational efforts will be released distributed open-source programs. Altogether, our released resource will accelerate research in the broader scientific community by providing essential tools to investigate immune function, which will benefit other investigators exploring the genetic underpinnings of immune system function of HIV and/or SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study is to leverage high-dimensional, multi-scale, and highly heterogeneous genomics data to discover the essential molecular alterations of immune cells introduced by HIV and/or substance use disorder (SUD) at a single-cell resolution. In contrast to existing methods that rely on either transcriptome or epigenome only, this work assumes that several key transcriptomic, epigenetic, and regulatory network alterations jointly occur with HIV and/or SUD, resulting in immune system dysfunction. Hence, we propose a computational framework to depict the comprehensive immune cell regulome, construct molecular networks of various cell types, and pinpoint key immune dysfunction driver events at a single-cell resolution.","A Big Data Approach to Identify Epigenetic, Transcriptomic, and Network Dynamics as Immune Dysfunction Drivers Associated with HIV Infection and Substance Use

"Secondary Analysis of Cognitive Data from the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) to Identify Longitudinal Change Phenotypes in HIV+ Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY Antiretroviral therapies (ART) have modified Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection from a nearly universal fatal disease to a manageable chronic condition, yet associated symptoms like cognitive impairments (CI) persist at a higher rate than in comparable uninfected control populations. These impairments are heterogeneous in terms of presentation (e.g. cognitive domains) and trajectory. Given that domain-specific impairments are likely due to different pathological changes, studies that investigate CI based on a global metric of impairment are likely to miss this. The application of advanced analysis methods, including machine learning to interrogate complex diseases and biological processes, is beginning to transform our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to complex diseases, including CI in the setting of HIV infection. In order to identify and characterize factors that contribute to nonlinear patterns of cognitive change, we propose to capitalize on over 20 years of data from the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). MACS is one of the largest and longest running studies of men infected with HIV, that includes a substudy with biannual neurocognitive testing that began in 1988. A complete battery of longitudinal neurocognitive testing data is available to us through this cohort, as well as concurrent datasets that include demographic, clinical, psychiatric, lifestyle and biochemical data. The data set consists of over 3500 subjects with over 500,000 data points. In Aim 1, we propose to use data-driven methods (k-means clustering for joint longitudinal trajectories and dynamic time warping) to identify groups of individuals with distinct domain-specific patterns of cognitive change. In Aim 2, we will use the vast amount of data collected on these subjects to identify subtype-specific variables that contribute or predict group membership. By using advanced machine learning methods that are unconstrained by preset statistical or biological assumptions, we are uniquely positioned to identify factors that contribute to longitudinal patterns of change in specific cognitive functions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive changes in HIV can be indicative of varying neuropathological mechanisms of impairment. This project aims to shed light on those mechanisms by analyzing pre-existing data from the MACS cohort to identify groups of HIV infected men with similar cognitive trajectories and then mining the available data to identify risk factors and contributing variables to those trajectories. By using advanced machine-learning methods to analyze non-linear patterns we will provide insights into the underlying biological mechanisms of domain-specific cognitive declines and may create an iterative framework for precision-based medicine approaches to treat cognitive impairment.",Secondary Analysis of Cognitive Data from the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) to Identify Longitudinal Change Phenotypes in HIV+ Individuals,10013477,R03MH123290,"['Cohort Effect ', ' Generation Effect ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lipids ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Population Control ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Running ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Group Identifications ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Peripheral ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Metabolic ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neurocognitive test ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' cognitive change ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Pathologic ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' data reduction ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' HIV anti-retroviral ', ' HIV antiretroviral ', ' co-morbid symptom ', ' co-occuring symptom ', ' comorbid symptom ', ' concurrent symptom ', ' cooccuring symptom ', ' symptom association ', ' symptom comorbidity ', ' associated symptom ', ' secondary analysis ', ' The Multi-center AIDS Cohort Study ', ' The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,81875,0.19727861592894086
"Personalized strategies for HIV treatment maintenance: an application of novel machine learning methods to HIV care in East Africa PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: Despite the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy (ART), public health efforts to treat persons living with HIV must address issues with patient retention in order to achieve lasting epidemic control. People living in African countries with high rates of HIV infection face different barriers to retention, including structural barriers (e.g. transport to clinic), psychosocial barriers (e.g., stigma), and others (e.g., long waiting times). This diversity of barriers contains a critical implication: no single behavioral intervention will help all patients remain in care. Given the absence of a “one-size-fits-all” solution to HIV treatment maintenance, Drs. Petersen and Geng (the current project's sponsors) co-lead a nearly completed NIH-funded trial (ADAPT-R; NCT02338739) that identifies adaptive strategies for patient retention. In ADAPT-R, HIV-positive patients initiating ART are randomized to a low-intensity intervention to prevent retention lapses. Patients are re-randomized to a high-intensity intervention to facilitate their return to care, only if initial retention is poor. By responding to a single aspect of individual patient behavior (days in treatment), this adaptive strategy is actually more efficient (patients succeeding avoid more costly interventions) and effective (patients not well-retained receive more intensive support) than intervention assignment strategies in traditional trials that assume “one size fits all.” Approach: The current proposal uses recent advances in statistics, machine learning, and causal inference to develop an analysis plan that not only leverages, but also innovates, the parent trial. This project proposes to use ADAPT-R data to design algorithms that assign each patient his/her personalized interventions based on patient characteristics measured at baseline (e.g., demographics, distance from clinic, stigma) and over time (e.g., lapses in care, updated clinical data measures, past interventions). By making optimal use of all patient characteristics measured in ADAPT-R (i.e., not just early lapses in care) to assign interventions, it is hypothesized that these algorithms will be most efficient and effective at retaining patients, compared to assignment methods used in ADAPT-R and “one-size- fits-all” traditional trials. Specific Aims: This F31 Diversity grant aims to: 1) design and test an algorithm that assigns each patient a personalized low-intensity intervention for remaining in HIV care; 2) design and test an algorithm that assigns each patient a personalized low- and high-intensity intervention, in sequence, for remaining in HIV care. Impact: This project provides an opportunity to learn more effective ways of administering existing interventions to improve HIV retention in rural Africa. At the broadest level, this work aims to advance the toolkit for developing Precision Public Health strategies. Fellowship information: This project is the dissertation of Ms. Lina Montoya, a PhD student in Biostatistics at University of California, Berkeley. Ms. Montoya has chosen one primary sponsor and two co-sponsors with complementary expertise and collaboration in the fields of statistics, HIV, global health and implementation science. Her training will consist of 2 years of research, coursework, and professional development. PROJECT NARRATIVE HIV-positive patients in sub-Saharan Africa face diverse barriers to receiving treatment; thus, there does not exist a “one-size-fits-all” behavioral intervention to help patients remain in care.

"Mapping and dissecting the role of antibodies in Mtb control While a quarter of the world carries the burden of tuberculosis, emerging data suggests that those coinfected with HIV are at an elevated risk of reactivating the disease. However, the specific immunological perturbations that lead to loss of Tb control are poorly understood. One critical risk factor associated with HIV coinfection is the depletion of CD4 T cells, which has been linked to increased Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) uptake into macrophages and diminished granuloma integrity. However, even with the restoration of CD4 T cells with HAART, Mtb/HIV co-infected individuals continue to exhibit a higher risk of Mtb reactivation. However, CD4+ T cell loss/perturbations may also contribute to loss of Mtb containment through indirect mechanisms such as the loss of the requisite help to B cells required for the production of highly functional antibodies. Along these lines, mounting data point to an enrichment of anti-microbial antibody responses among latently infected individuals, able to contain bacterial growth in vitro and even control bacteria in vivo when transferred to mice prior to challenge. Thus, given our emerging appreciation for a role for antibodies in Mtb-control/killing, here we propose to use a systems serology profiling approach, to begin to define the specificities and functions of antibodies that contribute to longitudinal control of Mtb in both HIV uninfected and infected populations. Moreover, linked to B cell cloning, Fc-engineering, and in vitro/in vivo models, we also seek to divorce humoral biomarkers of Mtb control from mechanistic roles of antibodies in preventing progression to TB. Collectively, these data will provide novel insights into the potential humoral profiles that if harnessed via vaccination or through therapeutics may lead to enhanced control of Mtb.

"Automated Digital Imaging for Cervical Cancer Screening Project Abstract/Summary: Cervical cancer screening programs remain essential to reduce cervical cancer in women despite the availability of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines. Screening is important for all women but is particularly important for women living with HIV given the high prevalence of HPV in this group and risks associated with progression notwithstanding antiretroviral therapy. Here we propose to investigate the clinical utility of a new method of automated digital imaging of the cervix on the MobileODT platform as a screen-and-treat approach. We build on a long-term collaboration between the University of Cape Town and Columbia University investigating how to strengthen cervical cancer screening and treatment in South Africa. Currently, screen-and-treat programs utilizing HPV DNA testing are recommended by the World Health Organization. We have demonstrated the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this approach for the South African setting with its high HIV prevalence in women. In this setting, we are currently completing an NCI- supported study demonstrating the feasibility and outstanding performance of an HPV DNA assay that can be used at the point-of-care for a single-visit, screen-and-treat program. Here we propose to extend this work to investigate in Specific Aim 1: the performance characteristics of automated digital imaging as a standalone, primary screening test to replace HPV DNA testing for use in the single-visit, screen-and-treat approach; Specific Aim 2: the performance characteristics of automated digital imaging as a triage test for women who test HPV DNA positive in the screen- and-treat approach; and Specific Aim 3: facility-level operational challenges and facilitators to integrating this new imaging technology into single-visit screen-and-treat programs. We propose to undertake the studies to address these aims among women living with and without HIV at clinical sites in Cape Town, South Africa. Our overall goal is to strengthen cervical cancer screening approaches to reduce cost and improve the effectiveness of screening. Project Narrative We propose to investigate the accuracy and implementation potential of a new technology that provides an automated and almost instant classification of cervical cancer precursor lesions based on a cloud-based, machine-learning algorithm of an image of the cervix.

"Improved analysis of experiments and observational studies in HIV ABSTRACT More robust and accurate health knowledge is a cornerstone of better health policy and action. There are tough questions in HIV that can be addressed better with new quantitative tools. Results from experimental and observational HIV studies can be made better and more policy-relevant through development and use of new methods at the interface of statistics, epidemiology, causal inference, and artificial intelligence. An innovative combination of semiparametric statistical theory, causal models, and ensemble machine learning provides a unique opportunity for better results from HIV studies. In this work, we propose new estimators of the risk (or survival) function. These new estimators improve accuracy, accommodate competing events, allow effects to be generalized to specific populations of interest, incorporate machine learning of nuisance functions to relax assumptions about model form, and allow sensitivity analyses to quantify the impact of uncontrolled biases. The specific aims are vehicles to develop, test, and disseminate these new estimators. These aims are to 1) estimate the long-term treated history of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in this large US cohort of women with HIV; 2) estimate the observational analog of the per-protocol parameter using a treatment decision design to compare composite endpoints under an integrase-inhibitor-based treatment compared to an efavirenz-based treatment in the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design; 3) estimate the per-protocol parameter for TDF-FTC versus ABC-3TC arms; and 4) estimate the per- protocol parameter for 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate versus masked placebo on risk of preterm birth in Zambian HIV+ pregnant women. The assembled team features field-leading expertise in epidemiology, statistics, and HIV medicine. Scientific products will include publications and workshop presentations describing new methodological approaches and new substantive findings that emerge after applying the proposed methods to each of the problems identified in the specific aims. We will also produce publicly available R packages and SAS macros to implement the proposed estimators.

"Harnessing Bioinformatics for HIV Prevention: Understanding Persistence in Comprehensive HIV Prevention Services Project Summary/Abstract: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective at reducing the acquisition of HIV; however, achieving the full impact of this intervention is contingent on maintaining engagement in care throughout periods of high and low risk. Currently, in the United States, only 270,000 out of 1.2 million individuals with indications for PrEP receive it. Additionally, even for those who start PrEP, adherence, and persistence in comprehensive HIV prevention care is poor, characterized by multiple discontinuations and restarts. Furthermore, HIV risk changes over time and individual-level reasons for engagement, very early disengagement (<2 visits after initiation), early disengagement (2-4 visits after initiation), and late disengagement (>4 visits after initiation) are not well described; social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH) like insurance, housing status, substance use, and mental health, are increasingly recognized as key factors. As PrEP programs expand to meet the projected need, the cost of providing support services will be substantial and thus identifying patients at highest risk of loss-to-follow-up and selecting optimal services to support persistence in care and PrEP adherence is essential. Furthermore, many individuals receiving HIV prevention services are known to receive highly fragmented care typified by multiple providers and institutions, thereby creating a challenge to accurately characterize persistence in care. Guided by the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model, we propose to address this critical area of research by focusing on factors that are associated with very early, early, and late disengagement from HIV prevention care. We will identify baseline factors through a comprehensive questionnaire conducted at the time of enrollment into comprehensive HIV prevention care. We will layer onto that longitudinal factors, such as social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH), which can vary over time, to get a more comprehensive and precise picture of factors affecting persistence in prevention care. To address the issue of fragmented care and better characterize persistence in care, we will utilize information contained in a large Health Information Exchange (HIE), Healthix, to capture all health care visits in New York. We propose to use machine-learning methods to design predictive models of disengagement from HIV prevention care. This comprehensive assessment of persistence in HIV prevention care will inform the development of high quality, scalable models of HIV prevention care, making it possible to target limited resources towards individuals at the highest risk of disengagement. Project Narrative: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective at reducing the acquisition of HIV; however, achieving the full impact of this intervention is contingent on keeping patients engaged in care throughout periods of high and low risk. HIV risk changes over time and a person’s reasons for engagement, disengagement, and re- engagement in care are not well understood, but likely change over time. In this project, we propose to utilize self-reported and clinical data to elucidate reasons for very early disengagement (<2 visits after initiation), early disengagement (2-4 visits after initiation), and late disengagement (>4 visits after initiation) and use machine learning methods to design predictive models for disengagement from HIV prevention care.",Harnessing Bioinformatics for HIV Prevention: Understanding Persistence in Comprehensive HIV Prevention Services,10083011,K23AI150378,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Housing ', ' Insurance ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Schedule ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Presbyterians ', ' Presbyterian Church ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Prevention program ', ' prevention service ', ' computer-based representation ', ' frame-based representation ', ' knowledge representation ', ' information organization ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Healthcare Visit ', ' Health Care Visit ', ' Clinical Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' modifiable risk ', ' high risk ', ' health data ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' machine learning method ', ' clinical trial analysis ', ' ']",NIAID,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K23,2020,191976,0.29287687279567315
"An Adaptive Strategy for Preventing and Treating Lapses of Retention in Adult HIV Care II (ADAPT-R II) Abstract This R34 application is best understood in the context of both a NIH-funded sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) “Adaptive Strategies to Prevent and Treat Lapses of Retention (ADAPT-1)” nearing completion and a future trial (ADAPT-3) motivated by observations from the ADAPT-1. Retention in HIV treatment over long periods of time represents an archetypal complex public health problem and requires innovative solutions. The diversity of intensities and types of barriers to engagement mean that no single intervention is needed by all nor will work for all in need. For example, counseling could help a patient experiencing stigma, but will not help an individual who wants to come but cannot afford transportation. To respond to this conundrum, we carried out a SMART (ADAPT-1) to test a family of adaptive retention strategies. By maintaining lower intensity interventions in those doing well, adaptive strategies optimize efficiency, while escalating in those not doing well enhances effectiveness. In ADAPT-1, we initially randomized patients to one of three lower intensity interventions (standard of care (SOC), SMS messages and a conditional cash transfer). Only those who fail to be consistently retained are re-randomized to one of three more intensive interventions (SOC outreach, SMS message with a conditional cash transfer, or a navigator). Emerging ADAPT-1 results (in forthcoming publications) confirm our original hypothesis that pegging the retention intervention to patient behavior improves outcomes, the study also revealed additional opportunities to extend a “precision public health” paradigm. Specifically, we observed that different patients (based on sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics) respond differentially to different adaptive retention strategies. This observation begs a further hypothesis: use of predictive analytics (optimized with cutting-edge machine learning techniques) to distribute each intervention (e.g., SOC, cash transfer, SMS) to those patients most likely to respond to that intervention can achieve further gains in effectiveness and efficiency over any single sequenced retention strategy, even if strategy is itself already adaptive. We plan a future R01 application to test a machine learning based distribution of retention interventions as compared to best single sequential adaptive interventions (from ADAPT-1). To prepare for the novel trial, we propose this R34, to (1) develop and test the information technology basis for delivering on-demand predictions to health care workers in the field, (2) refine the statistical foundations of machine learning ability to predict through simulations and (3) assess the fit of machine learning based recommendations in the organizational, policy and ethical context of health systems in Kenya. Project Narrative Engagement in HIV treatment, both retention and adherence, represents a persistent, complex health behavior problem in Africa where public health success over the long run demands innovative approaches to retain and virally suppress patients. We propose bringing the cutting edge of data science to the front lines of the HIV response by developing and testing a machine learning-based algorithm “Personalized Retention Recommendation and Learning Systems” (PERLS) to assign a limited set of scalable retention strategies for people living with HIV who are most likely to respond to those interventions in Kenya. This proposed R34 will lay the technological, statistical, and implementation groundwork for a future R01 application (ADAPT-3) which will test the effectiveness of PERLS on clinical endpoints and thereby advance a novel “precisions public health” approach to HIV treatment in Africa.",An Adaptive Strategy for Preventing and Treating Lapses of Retention in Adult HIV Care II (ADAPT-R II),10017320,R34MH121224,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Africa ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Environment ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Kenya ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Savings ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' Organizational Policy ', ' Privacy ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' data quality ', ' Funding ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Outcome Study ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Speed ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' health record ', ' outreach ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' Information Technology ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' standard of care ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' learning achievement ', ' learning competence ', ' learning ability ', ' trial design ', ' retention strategy ', ' student retention ', ' retention rate ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Science ', ' improved outcome ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' service delivery ', ' over-treatment ', ' overtreatment ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R34,2020,251025,0.2048274307390528
"Machine learning to distinguish HAND from Alzheimer's disease in HIV over age 60 The CDC estimated that one-quarter of Americans living with HIV were over the age of 55 in 2012. By next year, they will be over age 60, entering into the age demographic where Alzheimer's disease (AD) becomes a distinct differential for clinicians. Because up to one-half of people living with HIV experience cognitive impairment from HIV or related factors along, the likelihood for delayed diagnosis of early AD is substantial. Differentiating HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) from the Mild Cognitive Impairment stage of AD (MCI-AD) is one of the most pressing issues in geriatric neuroHIV. Current HAND nosology does not provide guidance on this issue. Published work suggests the likelihood for distinct phenotypes that would facilitate diagnostic sorting with commonly available inputs from neuropsychological testing and structural imaging. In this application, we will use a new approach that leverages computational machine learning with inputs from structural imaging, neuropsychological testing, motor examination and affective/behavioral assessments to determine the factors that most accurately discriminate HAND from MCI-AD. Our preliminary examinations using this novel technique demonstrate a likelihood that this approach will provide diagnostic sorting that exceeds 90% accuracy. We will examine tightly characterized phenotypes using HIV tests to exclude HAND and PET amyloid scanning to exclude AD among 75 HIV+/amyloid marker negative participants with HAND to 50 HIV-negative/amyloid+ cases with MCI (MCI-AD group), all age, sex and disease severity matched and all over age 60, the population of interest due to dual risk. Our methodology will iterate the most distinctive aspects of each disease's phenotype to inform sorting and subsequently, guidelines. We will validate the identified inputs that most clearly contribute to the algorithm though clinical correlations and through the ability of the determined clusters (e.g. diagnostic group) to predict the meaningful outcomes of disease progression. The long-term goal of this work is to inform clinical guidelines, thus, the modalities examined are readily available in clinical care. This work will also extend our understanding of neuropathology in older HIV patients and may identify factors that shift paradigms because our novel approach does not rely on a priori assumptions to inform neuropsychological abnormalities and brain structural alterations linked to HAND in older age. In an exploratory aim, we extend this examination of HAND neuropathogenesis with the added examination of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and a monocyte associated inflammatory marker, soluable CD163 (sCD163), two measures tightly linked to HAND in published work among virally suppressed patients in the current era.

"Neuroimmune mechanisms of depression in adults with HIV infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to understand neuroimmune mechanisms of depression in adults with HIV infection through analysis of plasma and CSF exosomes and the relationship of exosome protein cargo to inflammation and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism. Systemic inflammation in HIV infection and other conditions is associated with increased risk of depression through mechanisms involving altered tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism and other unknown mechanisms. Exosomes mediate cell-cell communication during inflammation and other conditions, but their role in neuroimmune interactions involved in depression have not been defined. Preliminary studies showed increased levels of circulating exosomes in HIV patients on ART compared to controls. Moreover, we identified heat shock proteins, Wnt proteins, and other protein cargo in these exosomes that correlate with HIV status, altered tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism, and depressive symptoms. Given that dysregulated Wnt/GSK3-β signaling and inflammatory responses have been linked to depression and other mood disorders, these findings suggest that circulating exosomes may play a role in neuroimmune interactions that impact depression through effects on Wnt/GSK3-β and/or TLR-mediated signaling. To address these questions, we will use clinical samples and data from well characterized HIV+ cohorts followed longitudinally to characterize plasma and CSF exosomes and their relationship to depression, inflammation markers, and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolites. Bioinformatics, computational modeling, and cell culture models will be used to build and test models that predict depression status and relevant pathways. This approach may define novel relationships between circulating exosome cargo and neuroimmune mechanisms of depression in HIV infection, potentially suggesting new therapeutic targets based on the biology of exosomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to understand neuroimmune mechanisms in the biology of depression in HIV infection through analysis of blood and CSF exosomes and their relationship to depressive symptoms, inflammation, and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism in longitudinal cohorts. Computational modeling will be used to build and test models for pathways that impact the biology of depression in the setting of inflammation and HIV infection.

"Mining real-time social media big data to monitor HIV: Development and Ethical Issues Social “big data” holds information with wide-ranging implications for addressing issues along the HIV care continuum. Social big data refers to information from social media and online platforms on which individuals and communities create, share, and discuss content. One in four people worldwide, or over a billion people, are publically documenting their activities, intentions, moods, opinions, and social interactions on these sites. They are doing so with increasing volume and velocity, including 400 million “tweets” per day on Twitter and 4.75 billion content items shared per day on Facebook. With an increasing number of these platforms supporting access to publicly-available user data, social big data analysis is a promising new approach for attaining organic observations of behavior that can be used to monitor and predict real-world public health problems, such as HIV incidence. New tools such as social data are therefore needed to supplement existing HIV data collection methods.  In preliminary research, our team developed the first approach that identifies psychological and behavioral characteristics from social big data (>550 million tweets) found to be associated with HIV diagnoses. Since groups at the highest risk for HIV (e.g., minority populations) are the fastest growing Twitter users, and because social media users have been found to publicly share personal information, we identified and collected tweets suggesting HIV risk behaviors (e.g., drug use, high-risk sexual behaviors, etc.) and modeled them alongside CDC statistics on HIV diagnoses. We found a significant positive relationship between HIV- related tweets and county-level HIV cases, controlling for socioeconomic status measures and other variables.  The problem is that this approach is not currently scalable for use by HIV researchers and public health organizations. Although public health agencies are interested in mining social data to address HIV, current tools are not accessible to most health scientists, as the tools require advanced computer science expertise. For example, analyzing 500 million tweets a day requires expertise in big data engineering, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. Developing a single platform for mining social data that has been designed and tested by and for HIV researchers could provide a significant impact on HIV prevention, testing, and treatment. We seek to create a single automated platform that collects social media data; identifies, codes, and labels tweets that suggest HIV-related behaviors; and ultimately predicts regional HIV incidence. Because of the potential ethical issues associated with mining people's data, we also seek to interview staff at local and regional HIV organization and participants affected by HIV to gain their perspectives on the ethical issues associated with this approach. The software developed from this application will be shared with HIV researchers and health care workers to provide additional tools that can be used to combat the spread of HIV.   Project Narrative  Surveillance and monitoring of HIV and related risk behaviors is a top priority for public health organizations. This project is of particularly high impact because it seeks to 1) develop software to allow (non- technical) researchers to analyze real-time conversations from social media big data to monitor HIV diagnoses, and 2) interview participants to learn about the ethical issues that need to be addressed when building this software. The software developed from this application will be shared with HIV researchers and health care workers to provide additional tools that can be used to combat the spread of HIV.",Mining real-time social media big data to monitor HIV: Development and Ethical Issues,9903175,R01AI132030,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Behavior ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Moods ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Label ', ' Site ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Letters ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' interest ', ' behavioral observation ', ' behavior observation ', ' computer science ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' health organization ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' combat ', ' public health priorities ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' social media ', ' Data Engineering ', ' Facebook ', ' Twitter ', ' Infrastructure ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' software infrastructure ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2020,737082,0.24470427103339218
"Predictive Analytics for Retention in HIV Care Retention in care is essential to HIV treatment and prevention, yet less than half of people living with HIV in the U.S. are retained in medical care. Effective retention interventions, such as intensive case management and patient navigation, are highly resource intensive. With diminishing resources for HIV care, better approaches are needed to identify patients at highest risk for retention failure who would most benefit from retention resources. A predictive model may quantify a specific patient's risk of future retention-in-care failure based on his/her unique characteristics. Such a predictive model based on electronic health data and supplemental social factor informed data could be automated to generate risk prediction in real time. Instead of attempting to locate and re-engage patients who are “lost to follow-up” as is the current practice, a predictive model would allow case managers to identify at risk clients and intervene to prevent retention failure before it occurs. I have a strong background in clinical informatics, biostatistics, and epidemiology. Through this K23, I will further develop my skills in longitudinal data analysis and advanced data analytics and create a predictive model of retention in care. In Aim 1, I will create a predictive model of retention in care using EHR data from a large clinical data research network spanning 11 healthcare systems in Chicago, utilizing mixed effects logistic regression and random forest. Through Aim 2, I will evaluate whether the addition of supplemental social factor informed electronic data sources into the predictive model enhances its performance (e.g., unstructured text of EHR notes, geospatial data, social media data). Finally, in Aim 3, I will explore the feasibility of using the model in real time to increase retention efforts for at-risk patients. I will complete this project under the supervision of my mentor (Dr. John Schneider), co-mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), and my advisory team (Dr. Robert Gibbons, Rayid Ghani, and Dr. C. Hendricks Brown). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in HIV research, EHR research, longitudinal data analysis, natural language processing, social media data, implementation science, and ethics. In addition, they serve as Directors of the Chicago Center for HIV Elimination (Schneider), Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Meltzer), Center for Data Science and Public Policy (Ghani), Center for Health Statistics (Gibbons), and Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for Drug Abuse and HIV (Brown). An integrated program of coursework, seminars, structured mentorship, research activities, and conferences will provide me with the skills necessary to complete the proposed research and transition to independence. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator utilizing HIV informatics to develop prediction models and tools to inform HIV prevention and treatment across the HIV care continuum. The mentorship and training that I will receive through this K23 award will provide me with the foundation necessary to pursue that goal and this proposal will form the basis for future R01 proposals. Retention in care is essential for HIV treatment and prevention, yet less than half of people living with HIV in the United States are retained in medical care. Electronic data, including advanced electronic health records, geospatial data, and social media profile data, can be used to create an automated predictive model to identify individuals at highest risk for retention in care failure. Instead of attempting to locate and re-engage patients who are no longer retained in care as is the current practice, a predictive model will allow case managers to identify at risk individuals and provide personalized retention resources based on individual risk factors before patients disengage from care.",Predictive Analytics for Retention in HIV Care,9982442,K23MH121190,"['Adult ', ' 21+

"Identification of Biomarkers of CNS injury and resilience related to HIV-1 and Methamphetamine PROJECT SUMMARY Methamphetamine (METH) is commonly abused and is a risk factor for HIV. METH also increases risk for adverse outcomes during HIV, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Multiple studies have demonstrated the neurotoxic effects of METH and HIV on brain structure and function, as well as neurobehavioral and functional performance. Biomarkers of central nervous system (CNS) injury and resilience would be valuable tools for understanding the METH- and HIV-associated pathogenesis and could provide valuable insights for drug development. The effects of METH and HIV outside the CNS (e.g., vascular and metabolic disease) are also important to consider and are a key gap in the field. Another key gap in the field is the translation of research findings to the clinic, including biomarkers that may be used to detect METH- and HIV-associated CNS injury and functional impairment across disease stages. Even less is known about biomarkers of resilience of the host defense mechanisms. Thus, in response to RFA-DA-18-023, this project proposes to screen a comprehensive panel of clinical and research biomarkers reflective of pathology and resilience with the goal of identifying and validating biosignatures that may improve the clinical assessment and diagnosis of brain and peripheral complications associated with METH and HIV. To accomplish this, we propose to leverage NIDA’s prior investment in UCSD’s NIDA-funded Translational Methamphetamine AIDS Research Center (TMARC), which performed standardized neurobehavioral, neuroimaging, and neuromedical assessments of participants who differed by METH use and HIV infection. We will recall and comprehensively re-assess 200 of these participants. Neuroimaging methods will include measures of cerebral blood flow, CNS metabolite levels, and a novel neuroimaging measure to estimate integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We will measure a comprehensive biomarker panel in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and stool samples, in specimens from their prior baseline visit, which are stored, and from their new visit and then analyze the data using traditional statistical approaches as well as novel techniques rooted in machine-learning and causal inference modeling. This approach will provide unique longitudinal data that will allow for the identification of biosignatures that predict changes in CNS injury and resilience. We will validate the observed biosignatures in an independent cohort of 100 participants who have been previously assessed at UCSD’s HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program and who have comprehensive data and stored specimens (e.g., CSF) available. To better respond to the clinical translation objective of the RFA, we will also compare measured biomarkers to data that are obtained during routine clinic assessments with the goal of identifying a clinical biosignature of METH- and HIV-related CNS injury. A thorough understanding of the impact of METH and HIV on systemic and CNS processes will address key gaps in the field. This insight should also inform the development of assays to inform diagnosis and effective disease and treatment monitoring. PROJECT NARRATIVE    Methamphetamine (METH) is one of the most commonly abused drugs by persons at risk for or living with HIV  disease  and  both  METH  and  HIV  can  have  substantial  adverse  effects  on  the  brain  and  other  organs.  This  application  proposes  to  identify  METH-­  and  HIV-­associated  biomarker  signatures  of  central  nervous  system  (CNS) injury and resilience and to translate them to the clinical environment. The identification and validation of  biomarker  signature  profiles  for  detecting  METH-­  and  HIV-­related  CNS  outcomes  would  have  substantial  public health relevance and could support earlier diagnosis and intervention.    ",Identification of Biomarkers of CNS injury and resilience related to HIV-1 and

"The Impact of Aging and HIV Infection on Immunologic and Transcriptomic Signatures of Influenza Vaccine Response It is estimated that approximately half of HIV-infected individuals in the United States are over 50 years of age. Aging of the HIV-infected population has linked alterations in immune responses associated with age and the immunologic consequences of chronic HIV infection. This intersection of HIV and aging will influence host defense against infection and response to vaccines. As a result, understanding the nexus of HIV-associated immune activation and immunosenescence takes on particular urgency. We will leverage insights from our published and ongoing studies on the effects of aging on dysregulated innate immune pattern recognition receptor (PRR) function, a novel population of pro-inflammatory IL-7 receptor alow effector memory (EM) CD8 T cells that are expanded in HIV-negative older adults, and on expansion of EM CD8 T cells in older HIV-positive adults. We have also elucidated gene expression and immunologic signatures of influenza vaccine response in young and older HIV-negative adults. These findings position us to illuminate the effects of aging and HIV infection on innate and adaptive immune function, particularly following influenza vaccination. To address these questions, we have assembled an interdisciplinary group of investigators with expertise in the study of aging of the innate and adaptive human immune systems, and in HIV immunology, biology and clinical care. Our overarching hypothesis is that the pro-inflammatory environment associated with age and with suppressed HIV infection potentiates immunosenescence in older adults with HIV disease. To test this hypothesis, we will enroll young (age 21-35) and older (age over 65) adults with HIV infection receiving high-dose influenza vaccine. We will employ state of the art methods including multichannel mass cytometry on whole blood to assess development and activation of major populations (e.g. monocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils), including novel studies of platelets pre- and post-vaccine. We will evaluate innate immune PRR function (including Toll-like and NOD-like receptor family members), where we previously found age-associated alterations in cytokine production and costimulatory protein expression that were related to influenza vaccine response. We will also study T cell responses to in vitro vaccine antigen stimulation, including the IL-7 receptor alow EM CD8 T cell subset. Statistical modeling will include clinical and functional covariates (e.g. CD4+ T cell count, estimated duration of HIV disease and of ART, medical co-morbidities, medication use, functional status). Finally, we will derive gene expression signatures of influenza vaccine response in young and older adults with HIV disease, and compare these to those we previously identified in HIV-negative adults. We will employ state of the art analytic methods to integrate gene expression and immunologic data to obtain a comprehensive view of the human immune response in the context of age and immune suppression. These studies ultimately are aimed at identifying pathways amenable to pharmacologic targeting to improve immune and vaccine responses in older (and young) adults with HIV disease. The proposed studies focus on understanding how aging and HIV infection affect the function of the immune system, particularly in response to influenza vaccination, to identify cell types and biologic pathways that are potential targets for the development of treatments to improve immune function.",The Impact of Aging and HIV Infection on Immunologic and Transcriptomic Signatures of Influenza

"EHR-Based Prediction Models to Improve PrEP Use in Community Health Centers PROJECT SUMMARY Rates of new HIV infections are disproportionately high, and uptake of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) low, in Black, Latino, and underinsured individuals in the U.S. Healthcare providers at safety net community health centers (CHCs) provide care to racially diverse populations with high rates of underinsurance. However, providers cite barriers to PrEP prescribing, including lack of tools to identify candidates for PrEP. Without practical tools to help providers identify patients at risk for HIV infection and prescribe PrEP when appropriate, the population-level benefits of PrEP are unlikely to be realized. Electronic clinical decision support using data embedded in patients’ electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential to fulfill this need. EHRs contain rich data that can help identify patients at high risk of HIV acquisition, including demographics, diagnoses, testing patterns, prescriptions, and social determinants of health. In our prior work, we developed and validated prediction models using EHR data from two large healthcare systems in Massachusetts and California, with patient populations of 1.1 and 4.3 million, to identify patients at high risk for incident HIV. These machine learning models had strong predictive performance, with C-statistics up to 0.91. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that a clinical decision support tool that incorporates an HIV risk prediction model can help providers identify patients at high risk for HIV infection and improve PrEP prescribing. Our study setting is a national network of CHCs with 2.8 million patients (OCHIN). We will first tailor our HIV prediction models to this clinic network, and then conduct formative work with providers to inform our development of alerts and additional PrEP decision support tools that will be effective and welcomed. The study team includes experts in HIV, PrEP implementation, predictive analytics, and healthcare delivery in CHCs. Our specific aims are to 1) optimize prediction models that use EHR data to identify potential PrEP candidates in racially, socioeconomically, and geographically diverse patient populations; 2) explore providers’ perspectives on barriers to PrEP prescribing, and their preferences for PrEP decision support, to inform development of an EHR-based decision support tool for CHCs; and 3) conduct a pilot trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of an EHR-based clinical decision support intervention on PrEP-related care in CHCs. We will assess impact on metrics across the PrEP care continuum, including prescriptions, persistence, clinical monitoring, and tests and diagnoses of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. This proposal is innovative in its use of predictive analytics and clinical decision support to optimize PrEP. The project is significant because our intervention will be scalable across CHCs nationally and to other healthcare systems with EHRs, and because it addresses the federal initiative to end the HIV epidemic by scaling up PrEP in high- incidence settings. The expected outcome is the foundation for a cluster randomized trial to test whether EHR- based decision support for PrEP can prevent new HIV infections in a national network of CHCs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scale-up of HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a key strategy of the federal initiative to end the HIV epidemic. However, healthcare providers lack tools to identify patients who are at increased risk for HIV infection and thus potential candidates for PrEP. This research will lay essential groundwork for a full-scale study to test whether integrating automated tools into electronic health records to help providers identify potential candidates for PrEP can improve PrEP prescribing and prevent new HIV infections in community health centers.",EHR-Based Prediction Models to Improve PrEP Use in Community Health Centers,9926611,R34MH122291,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' California ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Counseling ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Hepatitis B ', ' Hepatitis B Infection ', ' Viral Hepatitis B ', ' infection with HBV ', ' infection with hepatitis B virus ', ' serum hepatitis ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' hep C ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' statistics ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Latino ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Underinsured ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Clinical ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' Community Health Networks ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Notification ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' antiretroviral ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' member ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' pilot trial ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' routine care ', ' HIV/STI ', ' STD/HIV ', ' STI/HIV ', ' HIV/STD ', ' social health determinants ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' support tools ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' clinical decision support ', ' risk prediction model ', ' Automated Clinical Decision Support ', ' side effect ', ' anal pap screening ', ' anal pap test ', ' anal pap smear ', ' ']",NIMH,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R34,2020,280307,0.29546806186817937
"Targeted Learning using adaptive designs for HIV Epidemic control in East Africa PROJECT SUMMARY Scientific approaches to detect and respond to gaps in the public health response to HIV face a broad challenge with profound implications: after more than a decade of intensive service scale-up, the magnitude and reasons for remaining gaps in the treatment and prevention cascades differ markedly across people, communities, organizations, and geographies. As a result, strategies to control the epidemic must efficiently identify people and places most in need of intensified HIV testing, prevention, and treatment support, and deliver to each a timely and effective intervention. This poses a distinct scientific task: methods are required to discover and leverage continually evolving information to optimize “local” estimates of how best to allocate limited resources for both measurement and intervention. To meet this need, we propose a set of theoretical and applied aims that advance the use of adaptive designs– i.e. repeated “learn-and- apply” cycles– as a strategic approach for implementation science in heterogenous environments. Our approach uses four steps. First, we will extend existing statistical theory to allow machine learning to direct ongoing adaptation in who to measure and how to intervene, thereby creating approaches that maximally leverage the increasingly rich program data available in the HIV epidemic response. Second, we will use existing data from several unique field studies to create “virtual laboratories” for method validation and evaluation: 1) a sampling study to assess mortality on treatment in 64 facilities and 165,000 patients in Zambia; 2) an 1800-person individually randomized trial to optimize retention in HIV treatment in Kenya; and, 3) a cluster randomized trial of HIV treatment as prevention in 32 communities and 150,000 adults in Kenya and Uganda. Third, we will use these data to compare the methods developed against benchmarks provided by standard approaches (e.g. fixed sampling or balanced randomization). Fourth, we will develop accessible software for several general classes of problems in the HIV epidemic response and implementation science more broadly. Aim 1 seeks to develop and evaluate adaptive sampling designs that target data gathering based on past information to better detect locations and subpopulations with elevated risk. Aim 2 seeks to develop and evaluate adaptive designs that continuously target intervention assignment to learn how best to distribute interventions with heterogeneous effects. Aim 3 seeks to develop and evaluate adaptive strategies that use past data to target combined data gathering and public health interventions to simultaneously discover regions of elevated risk and guide intervention decisions. Overall these methods offer the promise of detecting gaps in the HIV response more quickly, with fewer resources, and with fewer “missed signals”, and of intervening more effectively within a context of constrained resources by assigning interventions better tailored to individual and context-specific needs. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the current HIV epidemic response, high variability in implementing contexts and epidemic settings demands epidemiological designs and analytic methods that are able to detect and respond to heterogeneity effectively and efficiently. We propose a series of aims that leverage the rich data increasingly generated in the course of the HIV epidemic response, and apply targeted machine learning to advance adaptive design and analytic approaches. For each aim, we: 1) propose theoretical advancements to current adaptive design methods; 2) use large-scale contemporary data from the HIV epidemic in East Africa to build virtual analytic laboratories; 3) test the performance of the proposed innovations in these settings; and, 4) develop statistical software that can be implemented by applied epidemiologists to address real world problems.",Targeted Learning using adaptive designs for HIV Epidemic control in East Africa,9926564,R01AI074345,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Africa ', ' Communities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Geography ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Kenya ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Uganda ', ' Zambia ', ' Northern Rhodesia ', ' Measures ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Services ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Prevention ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' scale up ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' community organizations ', ' implementation science ', ' effective intervention ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' public health intervention ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' trial design ', ' remote laboratory ', ' virtual lab ', ' virtual laboratory ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' implementation strategy ', ' Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,613304,0.28112686209349835
"Feature selection of DNA methylation biosignatures for neuropathy with comorbid drug abuse in the setting of HIV infection Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSPN) remains the most common neurological complication in HIV-infected population. Opiates and cocaine are often misused to manage neuropathic pain. These drugs, in turn, increase the risk of DSPN and exacerbate DSPN severity. The interplay of DSPN and substance use disorder (SUD) is associated with morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Although neurotoxic effects of HIV-1 gp120 and antiretroviral medications contribute to DSPN through dysregulation of pro-inflammation genes, little is known about the mechanisms of DSPN and DSPN with comorbid SUD. A major barrier to advancing our understanding of DSPN is the inaccessibility of nerve tissues in living individuals and the absence of reliable biomarkers to inform the diagnosis of DSPN in the setting of SUD and HIV infection. Our overarching goal is to discover the DNA methylation signatures for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We focus on white blood cells (WBCs) because of their role in orchestrating and effecting immune responses and because they are highly accessible tissues. We hypothesize that DSPN emerges in the context of HIV infection as the result of HIV-1 enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in many cell types, including WBCs. We also hypothesize that DSPN emerges as the result of SUD-enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in WBCs. Thus, DNA methylation in WBCs is associated with DSPN that is influenced by SUD and contributes to HIV outcomes. To test the hypotheses, we will select methylation features in WBCs for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity using a combination of epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and ensemble-based machine learning approaches. Leveraging two well-established independent cohorts, we will first identify methylation sites in WBCs for DSPN and SUD in four groups (DSPN+/SUD+, DSPN+/SUD-, DSPN-/SUD+, DSPN-/SUD-) in 2,000 HIV- infected samples using a 2-stage EWAS followed by a meta-EWAS. We will then select methylation features using machine learning methods and test the sensitivity and specificity to differentiate DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We will apply our in-house developed bioinformatic package, smartFeatureSelection. The selected features will test associations with immune resilience (i.e. CD4+/CD8+) and HIV outcomes (i.e. frailty, mortality). Finally, we will explore the biological functions of the identified methylation sites in postmortem human brain and blood (N = 80) by RNA-seq and correlate methylation-regulated gene expression between WBCs and neural cells. We expect to discover a set of biologically meaningful methylation features as a marker for HIV- infected DSPN and SUD that can predict resilience and outcomes. Employing a rigorous design and a powerful computational approach, this application proposes the first epigenome-based prediction for DSPN, SUD, and their interaction. The identified features can serve as a biomarker for this complex condition and have potential clinical use. The results will enhance the knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms in blood and in brain for HIV-infected DSPN and SUD. Distal sensory polyneuropathy and substance use disorder are common in the HIV-infected population and can impact immune resilience and HIV outcomes. Applying a combination of epigenome-wide association and machine learning approaches, we aim to identify a panel of DNA methylation features in white blood cells for HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy and substance misuse that link to immune resilience, HIV frailty and mortality. The selected features can serve as biomarker for neuropathy and enhance our understanding of the interplay between neuropathy and substance misuse in HIV-infected population.",Feature selection of DNA methylation biosignatures for neuropathy with comorbid drug abuse in the setting of HIV infection,9928910,R01DA047820,"['Aging ', ' Association Learning ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Complication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Envelope Protein gp120 ', ' HIV Envelope Glycoprotein gp120 ', ' HIV env Protein gp120 ', ' HTLV-III gp120 ', ' gp120 ', ' gp120 ENV Glycoprotein ', ' gp120(HIV) ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV-1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Leukocytes ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' White Cell ', ' white blood cell ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nerve Tissue ', ' Nervous Tissue ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Thalamus ', ' thalamic ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Veterans ', ' Polyneuropathy ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Immunological response ', ' host response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' Immune response ', ' Inflammatory ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' frailty ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' neuropathic ', ' Neuropathy ', ' Sensory ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' brain tissue ', ' Performance ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' antiretroviral ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' DNA Fingerprinting ', ' DNA Profiling ', ' DNA Typing ', ' Genetic Fingerprintings ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' immune function ', ' CD8 ', ' CD8B ', ' CD8B1 ', ' LYT3 ', ' CD8B1 gene ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Molecular ', ' neuropathic pain ', ' painful neuropathy ', ' epigenomics ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Advanced Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' neurotoxic ', ' biosignature ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' cocaine use ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' epigenome ', ' model building ', ' EWAS ', ' epigenome wide association analysis ', ' epigenome-wide association studies ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid use ', ' medication misuse ', ' drug misuse ', ' substance misuse ', ' Women’s Interagency HIV Study ', ' feature selection ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,595425,0.21621024663572
"A Randomized Clinical Trial to Assess the Effectiveness of Ablative Treatments for Cervical-Cancer Risk Reduction in HIV+ Women living in Mozambique Invasive cervical cancer is the 4th most common cancer and cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) experience almost 90% of the global cervical-cancer burden, with sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) experiencing the highest rates of cervical cancer. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which also disproportionately affects SSA, greatly increases the risk of cervical cancer. The World Health Organization now has a call-to-action for the elimination of cervical cancer, which includes vaccination young adolescents against human papillomavirus (HPV), the obligate viral cause of cervical cancer, and screening mid-adult women for the early detection and treatment of cervical abnormalities before becoming cancerous. However, both the best strategy for treating cervical abnormalities in women living with HIV (WLWH) from SSA and how to mitigate treatment failures are unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we propose a randomized clinical trial to assess the treatment effectiveness of two ablative methods of treatment, gas-based cryotherapy and thermocoagulation, for treatment of CIN2/3 and high-risk HPV in WLWH women. Eligible, confirmed WLWH women (n=5,014), ages 25-49 years, and living in Maputo, Mozambique, in conjunction with the local PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief) program, will be recruited to participate in this trial when attending their routine HIV-care visit. Consenting WLWH will be screened by rapid, point-of-care hrHPV DNA testing, unaided visual inspection after acetic acid (VIA), and “deep learning”-derived, automated visual evaluation (AVE) algorithm applied to a digital image captured on a cell phone, thereby ensuring that most CIN2/3 in the population is identified and treated. Screen-positive (HPV, VIA, 6-mo AVE positive) women will be 1) randomly assigned to either the GBC or thermocoagulation, 2) undergo a rigorous colposcopic evaluation and biopsies to determine the (post-hoc) diagnosis of the cervical abnormality, and 3) undergo their assigned treatment if ablation eligibility or LEEP if ineligible based on WHO guidelines8. Adverse events and pain data will be collected systematically during the treatment visit and during an at-home, one month post-treatment visit by community health workers. Six- and 18-month follow-up visits will be used to assess effectiveness of these treatments against CIN2/3 and hrHPV. Nested studies will evaluate whether 1) specific HPV genotypes, CD4 and HIV viral load, and/or lesion size, location, and severity (i.e. imperfect adherence to WHO guidelines), are risk factors for treatment failures by each method and 2) deep-learning algorithms applied to digital images can predict ablative treatment failures and thereby used in the future to triage screen-positive women to LEEP instead of ablation and thereby potentially be avoided those treatment failures. Secondary analyses will assess the effectiveness of 12 different S&T strategies based on different combinations of 6 screening methods (hrHPV with no triage, hrHPV with triage using HPV genotype groups, hrHPV with VIA triage, hrHPV with AVE triage, VIA alone, or AVE alone) and two ablative methods. Project Narrative Women living in sub-Saharan Africa with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at the greatest risk of getting and dying from cervical cancer. The proposed study will compare two methods of treating cervical abnormalities for the prevention of cervical cancer in Mozambican women living with HIV.

"Using big data and deep learning on predicting HIV transmission risk in MSM population Project Summary An important global public health priority is to develop new methods for identifying populations at greatest HIV risk, understanding HIV transmission network patterns, and intervening to reduce network risk. HIV testing is important to effect positive sexual behavior changes, and is an entry point to treatment, care, and psychosocial support. At the end of 2016, an estimated 1.1 million persons aged 13 and older were living with HIV infection in the United States, including an estimated 162,500 (14%) persons whose infections had not been diagnosed. In addition, many persons with HIV are tested late in the course of infection. Late testing results in missed opportunities for prevention and treatment of HIV, and increased risk for transmission to their partners. Current status – A number of epidemiological studies have employed social network theory/concepts and applied network analytical techniques to examine the structural characteristics of HIV transmission networks through phylogenetic link (HIV-1 pol sequences) and/or sexual/social/drug-using contacts among MSM. These studies, however, usually reduce the network information to summary information, consider only a subset of network variables, and/or use one layer of multi-dimension networks determining transmission paths such as only the social, sexual, contact, and venue perspectives. Challenges: The complexity of data that is important for HIV infection risk analysis makes it challenging to conduct risk and transmission prediction. More specifically, we are facing two challenges: (1) How to develop a mechanism to faithfully and flexibly represent the multi-dimensional network data collected from different sources at different time periods; (2) Once the data has been integrated, how to fully leverage the data to develop a risk prediction algorithm that considers the multi-dimensional networks with substantially interrelated factors in a comprehensive manner. Goals - We hypothesize that deep learning-based informatics approaches can provide a novel way for HIV infection risk prediction. In close collaboration with the public health department, we will construct a comprehensive framework that combines population-based molecular, behavior, and contact/partner tracing information including venue affiliation data and individual sex and drug-using behaviors, as well as existing locally collected cohort data. Using this dynamically collected data we will then develop practical deep-learning algorithms that leverage the comprehensive framework for cluster growth and identifying newly infected population. This proposal focuses specifically on ongoing epidemic growth among populations most at risk, including young men who have sex with men (MSM), which remain highly vulnerable to HIV in the U.S. Project Narrative A global public health priority is to develop new methods of understanding HIV transmission patterns, identifying and reaching community members at high risk for HIV infection, and intervening to reduce their infection risk. In close collaboration with the health departments of Houston and Chicago, we will construct a comprehensive framework that combines population-based molecular, behavior, and contact/partner tracing information including venue affiliation data and individual sex and drug-using behaviors, as well as existing locally collected cohort data.

"Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetii) Approach to Understanding the Biology Underlying HIV and Drug Abuse. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the proposed study is to advance our understanding of the complex networks of biology underlying variation in HIV viral load (VL) and latent reservoir (LR) among HIV+ individuals, and how cocaine abuse (CA) affects identified biological networks. With the success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and public health strategies to reduce HIV incidence, much of the HIV burden in developed countries is now as a chronic disease, including among drug users. Managing HIV progression (HP) and searching for an HIV cure are of paramount importance. Higher pretreatment VL is associated with HP and is associated with a larger LR. An HIV cure is dependent on eliminating the LR. Cocaine is one of the most frequently abused illicit drugs among HIV+ individuals and is known to increase VL, worsen HP, slow decline of viral production after cART, and, we hypothesize, affect the quantity of LR. Thus, there is a complex web of relationships among VL, LR, and CA, which are partially driven by and mediated through genetic susceptibility and gene regulation. As concluded by Le Cleric et al. (2019) in their recent review: “Only integrative approaches that combine all big data results and consider their complex interactions will allow us to capture the global picture of HIV molecular pathogenesis. This novel challenge will require large collaborative efforts and represents a huge open field for innovative bioinformatics approaches.” We propose Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetii) as a multi-method, multi-omic framework for discovering and understanding the biology underlying HIV outcomes and the effect of CA. We will apply Explainable Artificial Intelligence, network mapping, and Lines-of-Evidence integration to existing genome-, methylome-, and transcriptome-wide data across a number of cohorts in the following aims:   Aim 1: Identify gene networks underlying variation in HIV VL and LR applying GNetii.   Aim 2: Identify differences in HIV associated gene networks by CA.  This robustly designed study is significant and innovative: targeting key HIV outcomes affected by CA,  applying big data techniques to identify gene networks across multiple omics (enhancing discovery and  biological interpretation), and leveraging unique LR data. Our multiple Principal Investigator team includes  expertise in HIV, drug abuse, and computational biology. Thus, we are likely to produce important new  insights into key elements of HIV as a chronic disease: providing a basis for targeting unique features of CA  that impact VL and LR, which make HIV management and a cure more challenging in this population. PROJECT NARRATIVE With the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and public health strategies to reduce new HIV infections, much of the HIV burden in developed countries is now as a chronic disease, including among drug users.

"Long Acting Film Technology for Contraception and HIV Prevention (LATCH) PROJECT ABSTRACT Several studies (ASPIRE, VOICE) have shown that adherence is paramount to the success of HIV prevention methods in women. Providing women with options through alternative drug delivery technologies can positively impact adherence. A compelling strategy includes co-delivery of an anti-HIV agent with a contraceptive agent to prevent pregnancy. This proposal plans to develop a next generation multipurpose prevention technology (MPT) film platform for once a month intravaginal administration of the 4'-Ethynyl-2-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine (EFdA) prodrug (EFdA-P) and a progestin (levonorgestrel (LNG) or etonogestrel (ENG)) to achieve the dual goal of preventing HIV infection and pregnancy. EFdA-P showed increased bioavailability and tissue permeability compared to the parent EFdA, a highly potent exciting new antiviral drug. This versatile extended release MPT film platform is intended to provide a discrete, low cost and convenient alternative to women at high risk of HIV infection and unintended pregnancy. Recent data from our lab shows that films can deliver an anti-HIV agent in the vagina for up to 1 month even in the context of menses and sexual intercourse. Using this knowledge and our expertise in the development of intravaginal films, this proposal will develop a film platform for co-delivery of a progestin (licensed contraceptive agent) and EFdA-P at a predetermined rate for at least 1 month. MPT films containing EFdA will also be generated for comparison. The R61 phase of this milestone driven proposal will generate critical preformulation data for EFdA/EFdA-P and LNG/ENG drug combinations and optimize the MPT film formulation to achieve one- month delivery of both drugs with desired short-term stability. This phase will also establish the compatibility of film prototype with vaginal tissue and microbial flora in vitro followed by vaginal retention studies in the non- human primate (NHP) model. The R61 phase will demonstrate the ability of the MPT film prototype to attain desired release profiles of both drugs in vivo (NHP model). Using a clearly defined go / no go criteria, a lead MPT film will be transitioned to the R33 phase. The R33 phase will involve IND-enabling activities including drug- drug interaction, in vitro transporter and metabolism studies, manufacturing scale up and establishing long-term stability of the lead MPT film. It will also demonstrate the safety (rat, rabbit, and NHP) and efficacy of the lead MPT film against SHIV infection in NHP model. It will also confirm the ability of the film to function in the context of sexual activity and its ability to deliver contraceptive levels of progestin in the NHP model. The successful completion of proposed work will generate a novel extended release MPT film platform that can be applied to other drug combinations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The adherence of women to anti-HIV and contraceptives can be improved by providing convenient low-cost alternative product options. This project will develop novel extended release vaginal films that co-deliver anti- HIV and contraceptive agents for one month upon single intravaginal administration.",Long Acting Film Technology

"Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center Project Summary  This application is for the renewal of the Study to Help the AIDS Research Effort (SHARE), which has been the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) since 1984. The MACS was established with sites in Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles, initially to study the natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men and later, with the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the treated history of HIV infection, including the relationship between long-term controlled HIV infection and chronic diseases and co-morbidities associated with aging. To reflect these changing priorities in HIV research, SHARE has had subsequent enrollments to balance proportions of HIV- and HIV+ men and to reflect the HIV epidemic more accurately. Men enrolled have been followed semi annually since 1984 or enrollment and have a) provided questionnaire data, physical exam data, laboratory data (including HIV serostatus, T cell subset measurements, and HIV viral load measurements), and a large repository of plasma, serum, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other specimens; and these have permitted SHARE and MACS to make major contributions to the understanding of treated and untreated HIV disease, and comorbidities associated with increased survival due to antiretroviral treatment.  The present application, in response to RFA-HL-19-008, aims to extend followup of the SHARE cohort (about 640 men) from 2019 to 2026, to allow merger of SHARE (and the other MACS sites) with the nine sites of the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) into a single cohort, termed the MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS), that will include both men and women. The specific aims of the CCS are outlined in a parallel application from the putative Data and Coordinating Center (DACC) of the CCS, and the 10 Specific Aims of that single cohort are outlined in the DACC application for the CCS; these include Cardiovascular (CV), Pulmonary/Sleep (PS), Neurocognitive NC), Aging (AG), Cancer, HIV Pathogenesis (PA), Psychosocial (PS), Health Disparities, Platform (PL), and Career Development (CD) Aims. The specific aims of the SHARE Clinical Research Site (CRS) are to: 1) play a leading role in the achievement 7 of these Aims by the CCS (i.e., CV, PS, AG, PA, PS, PL, and CD), including serving as a reading center for echocardiography and sleep studies; 2) to contribute to the achievement of the other 3 CCS aims, and 3) to implement all applicable CCS protocols and support the scientific goals of the CCS. Local initiatives on inflammation and physical activity will also support these aims, which take full advantage of the extensive follow-up and repository of biological specimens already available from this cohort and which will be extended under this proposal, enabling further contributions to our understanding and care of comorbidities and other health issues faced by people living with HIV today. Narrative This application is for renewal for 7 years of the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a longstanding study of the natural and treated histories of HIV infection men who have sex with men in four US cites (Baltimore-Washington, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Chicago) which has made many important contributions to the treatment and understanding of HIV infection since 1984. For the next 7 years, we propose to integrate our site with the 9 WIHS sites into a new MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS) which will follow men already enrolled in Baltimore and Washington, DC, and also recruit a few new men replacing those who have been lost to the study, in order to better understand the long-term consequences of living with HIV, including possible effects on chronic diseases and aging, and to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of these consequences.",Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center,9903475,U01HL146201,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Chicago ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cryopreservation ', ' Cryofixation ', ' cold preservation ', ' cold storage ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' District of Columbia ', ' D.C.

"Big Data Analysis of HIV Risk and Epidemiology in Sub-Saharan Africa Project Summary/Abstract HIV is the largest single cause of death among adults in Sub-Saharan Africa, responsible for about a third of all deaths among adults. One of the key paradigms to halting HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa relies on identification of infected individuals and populations for delivery of biomedical and behavioral interventions. However, by the end of 2015 less that half of HIV-infected individuals accessed antiretroviral therapy (ART) despite expansion of eligibility and ongoing efforts to diagnose and initiate treatment. A better understanding of the social, behavioral, environmental, and economic contexts that influence HIV risk could improve the effectiveness and efficiency of programs that aim to identify and target HIV-infected populations. In response to the program announcement for “Harnessing Big Data to Halt HIV” (PA-15-273), the overall goal of this proposal is to develop new analytic tools in large-scale data to predict risk of HIV infection and to generate hypotheses about new or under-recognized risk factors in Sub-Saharan Africa. We plan four primary investigations: (1) Extract and harmonize all Sub- Saharan African nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys that include the HIV status of over 600,000 men and women collected in 29 countries, and hundreds to thousands of associated exposure variables; (2) Develop analytic tools based on LASSO and XWAS to predict HIV infection status and generate hypotheses about social, behaviorial, environmental, an economic risk factors; (3) Identify HIV risk in multi-country, large-scale data and synthesize findings across in Sub-Saharan Africa, and (4) develop a bioethics program to identify targets for new interventions and policies in a culturally and ethically sound manner. The project will develop leverage big data and high-throughput analytic methodology in the service of global HIV control. The outputs of this project include (1) accessible software code for efficient exploration of robust correlates of HIV status derived from the biggest collection of high-dimensional, harmonized, and nationally representative representative household surveys in the world, (2) an extensive landscape of the social, environmental, behavioral, and economic factors predictive of HIV infection among over 600K people tested for HIV in 29 Sub- Saharan countries, and (3) a ethical framework to enable practical, relevant, and appropriate translation and communication of findings. New models of HIV infection will facilitate identification of at-risk groups and the development of interventions to halt the HIV epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa. Project Narrative Advancing the the public health goals for global HIV, including the “AIDS-Free Generation” and “90-90- 90,” requires effective identification of HIV-infected individuals. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop new analytic tools to (1) predict HIV status using modern tools of statistical machine learning and (2) uncover new and under-recognized risk factors for HIV infection in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using person-level data including the HIV status of over 600,000 men and women collected in nationally representative household surveys from 29 countries, we propose to build a high-throughput statistical predictor of HIV status and apply a novel “X-wide association study” (XWAS) to search for and validate social, behavioral, environmental, and economic factors associated with HIV seropositivity. Through development of an ethical/decision making framework and with close consult of an advisory committee, the findings will be used to develop both broad and specific insights about risk factors and at-risk populations for improving HIV care and epidemiology.",Big Data Analysis of HIV Risk and Epidemiology in Sub-Saharan Africa,9892947,R01AI127250,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Algorithms ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communication ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Analyses ', ' Demographic Analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Household ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Persons ', ' Program Efficiency ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' sound ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Privacy ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Demographic and Health Surveys ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Country ', ' Consult ', ' Services ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Bioethicist ', ' Bioethics Consultants ', ' Effectiveness ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Output ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' behavioral economics ', ' high dimensionality ', ' testing services ', ' treatment services ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' health goals ', ' statistical learning ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large scale data ', ' statistical and machine learning ', ' ']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,691449,0.35691819003825265
"Development of a novel community-based high-performance surveillance network for drug use PROJECT SUMMARY Surveillance efforts for substance use are failing us. They rely on outdated risk prediction tools yet risk factors for HIV and overdose are context-specific and are impacted by the interplay between patient-, provider-, and system-level factors as well as epidemiologic realities in a community. They rely on direct estimation methods for measuring prevalence yet barriers such as lack of access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and harm reduction services, stigma, criminalization of drug use, and unaffordable housing prevent people who use drugs (PWUD) from being counted. Additionally, they rarely involve community engagement and surveillance data are not disseminated effectively to communities to achieve maximum benefit. In the context of the ongoing overdose crisis and recent outbreaks of HIV among PWUD in Indiana, Massachusetts, Kentucky, and West Virginia, the failures of this basic tool of public health take on a new urgency. The number of efficacious programs and interventions to prevent and treat substance use and HIV continues to grow, but without accurate estimates of the size of the pool of people at risk of overdose and for acquiring HIV and knowledge of their specific risk factors, these interventions cannot reach their full potential. We cannot reach people who we do not know exist and are at risk. We, therefore, need to immediately modernize and upgrade our surveillance capacity to understand the size and composition of drug-using populations. I am proposing an innovative, interdisciplinary research program that integrates epidemiology, community engagement, biostatistics, econometrics, and information dissemination to create a novel community-based, high- performance surveillance network for PWUD. I will do this by (1) creating a community engaged research (CEnR) process around big data for PWUD; (2) building community-specific risk prediction algorithms for HIV acquisition, disease progression, and loss to follow up among PWUD; (3) using enhanced indirect estimation methods to determine the size of populations of PWUD and to evaluate the impact of interventions; and (4) disseminating findings and translating research into action. The data centerpiece of this program will be the Public Health Data Warehouse, an individually-linked database from more than 15 Massachusetts government agencies, which includes more than 97% of the Massachusetts population. Preliminary analyses with this database are underway and will be made accessible to communities in real-time. This project represents an approach that is entirely divergent from traditional surveillance techniques by using a combination of complex methodologies with the community always at the center of the process—from initiation to final output. This novel Massachusetts cOMmunity-bAsed Drug use surveillANCE (“Moma Dance”) Network will begin in Massachusetts, but will serve as a model for other states and jurisdictions as they contend with the failures of their own surveillance systems for PWUD. These efforts will translate research into action at the community level and have an immediate and sustained public health impact on the drug use and HIV epidemics. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will create a novel community-based, high-performance surveillance network for people who use drugs (PWUD) through an interdisciplinary approach that combines community engaged research, machine learning, indirect estimation, and dissemination science. Through this process, communities will gain a more complete understanding of context- and community-specific risk factors and the true scope of the problem. This network will facilitate rapid knowledge transfer to communities, directly informing clinical care and local policy decisions regarding service planning and resource allocation, as they seek to respond to the ongoing drug epidemic in the U.S.",Development of a novel community-based high-performance surveillance network for drug use,10054384,DP2DA051864,"['Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Communities ', ' Dancing ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Government Agencies ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Housing ', ' Indiana ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Kentucky ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' Overdose ', ' Patients ', ' Population Sizes ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' West Virginia ', ' Measures ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' base ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Disease Progression ', ' tool ', ' PWUD ', ' people who use drugs ', ' people who use illicit drugs ', ' persons who use drugs ', ' Drug user ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' clinical care ', ' surveillance data ', ' surveillance network ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' prescription opioid ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' community building ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' overdose risk ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data repository ', ' data warehouse ', ' econometrics ', ' community involvement ', ' ']",NIDA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,DP2,2020,77554,0.2311958515759462
"The South African National HIV Pregnancy Cohort: evaluating continuity of care among women living with HIV ABSTRACT For the first time on a national level, we propose to utilize routinely-collected laboratory data to develop a cohort of pregnant women living with HIV in South Africa in a way that is uniquely robust to transfer across facilities. South Africa is home to more people living with HIV than any other country, and nearly one in three pregnant women attending antenatal care is living with HIV. Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased substantially since the start of the national ART program in 2004, with >95% ART coverage during pregnancy and delivery, and mother-to-child transmission of HIV greatly reduced. However, our work has demonstrated that women who initiate ART during pregnancy are at heightened risk of dropping out of care, particularly after delivery, leading to the potential for viral transmission, morbidity and mortality. It is difficult to evaluate the success of policies of expanded access to ART care, and assess continuity of care, due to the lack of a national longitudinal HIV care database. In addition, patient movement between unlinked facilities means that self-transfer often is misclassified as loss to care. To address this major shortcoming, our team at the Health Economics and Epidemiology Office (HE2RO) partnered with the South African National Health Laboratory Services in 2015 to use existing HIV-related laboratory data to create the South African National HIV Cohort. Now, through this five-year award, we propose to expand this successful project to use routinely- collected laboratory data to develop a cohort of pregnant women living with HIV in South Africa. We propose three specific aims. First, we will develop and validate a novel national cohort of pregnant women accessing HIV care. Using laboratory test data matched to facility type, we will identify entry to antenatal care to build the cohort, then describe key treatment milestones, including 1) engagement in antenatal care, 2) initiation of ART, 3) HIV viremia, and 4) continuity of HIV care in the postpartum period. Second, we will measure the effect of system-wide factors impacting continuity of care among pregnant women. We will assess policies of expanded treatment access on continuity of care using regression-discontinuity analyses. We then will assess mobility and its effect on continuity of care during and after pregnancy. Third, we will identify individual-level risk factors for loss from HIV care in order to develop targeted interventions to improve engagement in HIV care.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Women who initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy in South Africa are at high risk of dropping out of care – particularly after delivery – but efforts to evaluate continuity of HIV care among pregnant and postpartum women have been hampered by lack of a national longitudinal HIV care database. Through this five-year award, we propose to use routinely-collected laboratory data to develop a national cohort of pregnant women living with HIV in South Africa that is uniquely robust to patient transfer. This novel cohort of pregnant women will be a powerful tool available to policymakers, clinicians and researchers for improving our understanding of engagement in care among pregnant women in South Africa and assessing the performance of the South African national ART program in caring for pregnant women living with HIV.",The South African National HIV Pregnancy Cohort: evaluating continuity of care among women living with HIV,9984567,R01HD103466,"['Award ', ' Breast Feeding ', ' Breast fed ', ' Breastfed ', ' Breastfeeding ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Blood Tests ', ' Hematologic Tests ', ' Hematological Tests ', ' Hematology Testing ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Infant ', ' Laboratories ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Patient Transfer ', ' Patients ', ' Postpartum Women ', ' Post-partum Women ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Public Sector ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' South Africa ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Viremia ', ' viraemia ', ' viral sepsis ', ' virusemia ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Peripartum ', ' Perinatal ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Vertical Transmission ', ' mother to child transmission ', ' Vertical Disease Transmission ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Frequencies ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Viral ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' treatment program ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' health economics ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' BigData ', ' Big Data ', ' Mother-to-child HIV transmission ', ' virus transmission ', ' viral transmission ', ' South African ', ' post-partum care ', ' postpartum care ', ' antepartum ', ' antenatal ', ' patient mobility ', ' antenatal care ', ' data tools ', ' ']",NICHD,"WITS HEALTH CONSORTIUM (PTY), LTD",R01,2020,348982,0.27121975504441614
"Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center Project Summary  This application is for the renewal of the Study to Help the AIDS Research Effort (SHARE), which has been the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) since 1984. The MACS was established with sites in Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles, initially to study the natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men and later, with the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the treated history of HIV infection, including the relationship between long-term controlled HIV infection and chronic diseases and co-morbidities associated with aging. To reflect these changing priorities in HIV research, SHARE has had subsequent enrollments to balance proportions of HIV- and HIV+ men and to reflect the HIV epidemic more accurately. Men enrolled have been followed semi annually since 1984 or enrollment and have a) provided questionnaire data, physical exam data, laboratory data (including HIV serostatus, T cell subset measurements, and HIV viral load measurements), and a large repository of plasma, serum, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other specimens; and these have permitted SHARE and MACS to make major contributions to the understanding of treated and untreated HIV disease, and comorbidities associated with increased survival due to antiretroviral treatment.  The present application, in response to RFA-HL-19-008, aims to extend followup of the SHARE cohort (about 640 men) from 2019 to 2026, to allow merger of SHARE (and the other MACS sites) with the nine sites of the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) into a single cohort, termed the MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS), that will include both men and women. The specific aims of the CCS are outlined in a parallel application from the putative Data and Coordinating Center (DACC) of the CCS, and the 10 Specific Aims of that single cohort are outlined in the DACC application for the CCS; these include Cardiovascular (CV), Pulmonary/Sleep (PS), Neurocognitive NC), Aging (AG), Cancer, HIV Pathogenesis (PA), Psychosocial (PS), Health Disparities, Platform (PL), and Career Development (CD) Aims. The specific aims of the SHARE Clinical Research Site (CRS) are to: 1) play a leading role in the achievement 7 of these Aims by the CCS (i.e., CV, PS, AG, PA, PS, PL, and CD), including serving as a reading center for echocardiography and sleep studies; 2) to contribute to the achievement of the other 3 CCS aims, and 3) to implement all applicable CCS protocols and support the scientific goals of the CCS. Local initiatives on inflammation and physical activity will also support these aims, which take full advantage of the extensive follow-up and repository of biological specimens already available from this cohort and which will be extended under this proposal, enabling further contributions to our understanding and care of comorbidities and other health issues faced by people living with HIV today. Narrative This application is for renewal for 7 years of the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a longstanding study of the natural and treated histories of HIV infection men who have sex with men in four US cites (Baltimore-Washington, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Chicago) which has made many important contributions to the treatment and understanding of HIV infection since 1984. For the next 7 years, we propose to integrate our site with the 9 WIHS sites into a new MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS) which will follow men already enrolled in Baltimore and Washington, DC, and also recruit a few new men replacing those who have been lost to the study, in order to better understand the long-term consequences of living with HIV, including possible effects on chronic diseases and aging, and to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of these consequences.",Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center,10213917,U01HL146201,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Chicago ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cryopreservation ', ' Cryofixation ', ' cold preservation ', ' cold storage ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' District of Columbia ', ' D.C.

"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster

"Identifying adolescents at high risk of neurocognitive disorder: Development and validation of a composite risk index Project Summary  More than 1 in 3 children from lower middle income countries (LMIC) are cognitively impaired and at risk of neurocognitive disorder (ND) due to malnutrition, immune dysfunction, HIV, and poverty-associated parasitic infections. All LMIC children – including HIV unexposed uninfected (HUU), are at risk of ND but HIV-infected and HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) are at elevated risk. Presently, there is no reliable approach to separate these vulnerable children along the continuum of risk for new-onset/progressive ND. This problem prevents risk-stratification, timely identification and targeting of at-risk children for ND remediation or prevention interventions. This project solves these problems by defining and validating a composite risk index (CRI) that integrates rigorously identified ND risk factors based on prior research to predict future new or progressive ND. The risk factors include malnutrition, immune dysfunction and HIV status. These factors will be combined into the CRI using modern machine learning methods and longitudinal data available from established cohort of 750 Ugandan children age 6 – 18 years (250 PHIV, 250 HEU and 250 HUU). For HEU and HIV-infected children this index will be refined into CRI-HEU and CRI-HIV, respectively, to include applicable maternal ART, child's viral genome, and cART factors.  Preliminary data from this cohort have demonstrated that cognitive indices vary significantly within the 12 months reassessment period. Additional preliminary data shows that despite HAART, chronic-HIV infection as well as nutritional, immunologic, and viral genome factors are associated with deficits in executive function, psychosocial adjustment, and quality of life. We now propose to follow this already established cohort every 12 months to collect additional data at 0, 12, 24 and 36 months to be used in defining and validating CRI. CRI will be used to predict new-onset/progressive ND during follow-up. Specific aims include: 1. To develop a CRI by combining intake data on nutrition, immune parameters and HIV status and their  interactions and perform internal and external validation of CRI as predictor of ND at 12 months. 2. To further internally and externally validate CRI for “out-of-time-window” prediction from 24 to 36 months. 3. For HEU and HIV-infected children, to refine CRI into CRI-HEU and CRI-HIV, respectively, by including  type of maternal ART, viral genome parameters, current cART regimen/adherence (as applicable), and  their interactions. Overall Impact: This project advances the science needed to ensure that all children survive and thrive neurodevelopmentally whether HIV-infected, HEU, or HUU through establishment of predictive index for ND. Modifiable factors that are found to be driving this index can become potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies and behavioral interventions to mitigate the high burden of ND and/or HAND –if HIV infected. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE This project will define and validate a prognostic tool for proactively identifying children at elevated risk of neurocognitive disorder (ND) and/or HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) in order to produce knowledge that informs targets for interventions to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes and minimize ND/HAND. For the first time, established multiple separate risk factors for impaired neurodevelopment will be integrated to define a composite risk index based on factors of malnutrition and immune dysregulation. The index will then be refined for HIV-infected and HIV exposed uninfected children by incorporating maternal ART and HIV-specific factors – complications of long-term antiretroviral therapy and HIV-virus genetic factors. 0925-0001/0002 (Rev. 08/12) Page 1 of 1 Continuation Format Page",Identifying adolescents at high risk of neurocognitive disorder: Development and validation of a composite

"Developing an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot to Promote HIV Testing Title Developing an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot to Promote HIV Testing Abstract (30 Lines)  HIV testing jumpstarts the HIV prevention and treatment care continuum. HIV testing levels in men who have sex with men (MSM) and in diverse settings like Malaysia are especially low. MSM increasingly contribute to heightened HIV transmission in the presence of high levels of stigma and discrimination. For high risk MSM, new guidelines recommend frequent HIV testing, ranging from every 3 to 6 months. Yet, HIV testing in MSM often occurs less frequently due to individual (e.g., heightened concerns about risk disclosure), clinic (e.g., confidentiality breaches, and discrimination from healthcare providers) and policy (criminalization of same-sex sexual behaviors) barriers. HIV prevalence in MSM has soared to 21.6% in Malaysia, exceeding 40.9% in Kuala Lumpur. While surveillance surveys of MSM in Malaysia who meet criteria for PrEP suggest that lifetime HIV testing is 70.3%, past-year testing is 40.9% and only 9.5% were tested more than once-yearly despite extraordinary levels of self-reported risk. Once tested, however, MSM with HIV in Malaysia are likely to be treated with ART and achieve viral suppression, making HIV testing a central focus for HIV prevention and treatment.  Innovative strategies that motivate and provide guidance for testing among MSM in these settings are therefore urgently needed. Intervening using Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IBM) model of behavioral change is ideally suited to overcome barriers to recommended HIV testing in MSM. Moreover, in settings like Malaysia where the HIV epidemic has transitioned from primarily concentrated in PWID to a volatile epidemic in MSM, theory-guided behavioral change strategies that inform, motivate and provide pragmatic skills to more fully engage in recommended HIV testing are poised to accelerate the HIV prevention and care continuum. Given the many individual, clinic and policy barriers to HIV testing, mobile health (mHealth) interventions that reduce “in person” contact and offer a menu of behavioral skills is ideally suited to increase access to MSM in highly stigmatized settings and promote recommended HIV testing. Recent studies in the U.S., China, South Africa, and Peru show that mHealth interventions using smartphones and apps have the potential to increase HIV testing while maintaining MSM’s confidentiality and providing real-time information, motivation and behavioral skills to overcome barriers. Such mHealth interventions are feasible and acceptable among MSM, including in Malaysia where most MSM find sexual partners using smartphone apps with similar interfaces and functionalities to the proposed intervention. Current mHealth strategies, however, are limited by their lack of automation and need for high-intensity and sustained human inputs, which restricts their scale-up. Artificial intelligence using machine learning (AI/ML) may overcome such limitations, but have yet to be applied to mHealth-based HIV testing algorithms. We therefore aim to develop and pilot test to assess acceptability and feasibility of an AI/ML-Chatbot for HIV testing relative to treatment as usual (control). Findings from this exploratory pilot study will inform a future prospective Type 1 Hybrid implementation science trial. Project Narrative The proposed research will focus on developing a chatbot that adapts using machine learning and artificial intelligence to promote HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM). Once developed and adequately tested, the new chatbot (TestBot) will be embedded into a social networking app selected by MSM to create a mHealth intervention for MSM to promote real-time HIV testing-related information, motivation, and behavioral skills. TestBot will provide culturally-tailored messages to promote HIV testing in MSM that does not rely on intensive human resources to develop and maintain the intervention.",Developing an Artificial

"Health Informatics to Model the Scott County HIV Outbreak ABSTRACT Many regions of the United States, particularly rural and frontier areas, lack the resources to proactively identify isolated infectious disease outbreaks. Scott County Indiana experienced an HIV outbreak in 2014- 2015, resulting in approximately 200 new HIV infections. If not for a vigilant Disease Intervention Specialist (DIS) who noticed an escalating number of HIV infections in Scott County over a brief period of time, the outbreak could have been much worse. An isolated outbreak in resource-limited settings such as Scott County underscores the need for more innovative, automated, and real-time HIV biosurveillance systems in non-urban areas. To date, digital HIV epidemiologic research has relied almost exclusively on Twitter; however, this approach is likely too restrictive and has not yet yielded a promising approach to predicting HIV outbreaks. More heterogeneous sources of data--in addition to social media--may more efficiently predict the arrival of HIV in a community with limited surveillance resources. The proposed health informatics research will analyze historical time series data collected from 2014 through 2016 to identify predictor variables that model the Scott County HIV outbreak. Data to be analyzed include: (1) emergency room (ER) admissions and discharges related to opioid use and soft tissue infections related to drug abuse; (2) HIV testing surveillance data; (3) HCV incidence data; (4) search engine inquires of relevant topics, such as Google or Bing searches for “HIV testing” and “Opana”; (5) law enforcement arrest records (particularly those related to opioid possession and distribution); and (6) electronic healthcare reimbursement data of HIV-related treatments (e.g., post-exposure prophylaxis). Automated data/text mining and machine learning techniques will also be applied to (7) social media data (i.e., Twitter tweets and Reddit forum posts) that make reference to HIV, Opana, substance use, and other terms to determine if trends in social media data could have predicted HIV's arrival in, and transmission throughout, Scott County. Using the diverse data sources listed above, our team will correlate the time series of key predictor variables to identify the data source (or sources) most predictive of a known HIV outbreak. If our team develops a health informatics approach and algorithm(s) identifying trends in social media and other electronic data indicating an imminent HIV outbreak, state and county health departments can use these “signals” to increase the number of HIV testing and counseling sites in the affected area, health care providers can more aggressively screen for HIV/STI infection, syringe-service programs can be mobilized rapidly and targeted more efficiently, contact tracing activities can be initiated, and PEP and PrEP can be prescribed to those at risk for HIV infection in the geographic region of concern. This study will also examine feasibility issues related to the collection and analysis of electronic health information and social media data in HIV biosurveillance efforts, such as data accessibility, costs, and generalizability. Narrative In 2014, roughly 200 persons in rural Scott County Indiana were infected with HIV during an outbreak driven largely by widespread use of injected opioids, primarily Opana®. Had an automated biosurveillance system been in place, this isolated outbreak might have been identified at its earliest stages and a multi-faceted public health response could have been employed. Using heterogeneous sources of historical data from 2014 through 2016, the proposed health informatics research will analyze emergency room admissions and discharges for opioid overdose and soft tissue infections, social media posts, search engine inquiries, hepatitis C incidence data, and healthcare reimbursement data to determine if these data could have predicted the arrival and spread of HIV throughout Scott County Indiana.",Health Informatics to Model the Scott County HIV Outbreak,10017931,R21DA047893,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Communicable Diseases ', '

"Longitudinal Cognitive Outcomes in Children and Adolescents with HIV in Zambia Project Summary/Abstract:  This proposal represents a five-year research career development program focused on the study of longitudinal cognitive outcomes among children and adolescents with HIV in Zambia. The outlined proposal builds on the candidate’s prior research and experience, and will introduce the candidate to new skills that will be shared by the mentorship team led by Dr. Gretchen Birbeck, an expert in neuroepidemiology and clinical trials in resource-limited settings. The proposed training and mentored research will enable the candidate to transition to an independent research career focused on neurologic complications of HIV.  Cognitive impairment is common in children with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in low-resource settings, affecting up to 50% of perinatally-infected children in Sub-Saharan Africa. In children with HIV receiving Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), opportunistic infections and severe HIV-associated progressive encephalopathy have become less common, but more subtle forms of cognitive impairment have increased in prevalence. The foundation for this proposal is based on research conducted by the candidate as part of the HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorders in Zambia (HANDZ) study, in which 208 children and adolescents with HIV and 208 HIV-exposed uninfected controls were recruited, and clinical risk factors and biomarkers for cognitive impairment were evaluated. In the HANDZ study, we found that serum markers produced by activated platelets and pro- inflammatory monocytes associated with depression, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive impairment, suggesting that platelet-monocyte complexes (PMCs) may be key drivers in HIV-associated cognitive impairment. In the proposed project, the population recruited as part of HANDZ will be followed longitudinally for a total of five years, and an additional HIV-unexposed uninfected control group will be recruited.  The aims of this proposal include 1) To evaluate whether PMCs and pro-inflammatory monocytes predict depression and cognitive outcomes in ART-treated children and adolescents with HIV in Zambia 2) To assess whether PMCs and pro-inflammatory monocytes are associated with cerebrovascular disease in ART-treated children and adolescents with HIV and 3) To develop a comprehensive predictive model of cognitive change in children with HIV incorporating clinical characteristics, plasma biomarkers, and imaging biomarkers. The short- term goal of this application is to 1) Train the applicant through mentored research 2) Identify a subpopulation of children and adolescents with HIV at high risk of cognitive decline and 3) From clinical profiles, plasma biomarkers and imaging characteristics, identify factors associated with the greatest effect on cognitive outcomes that can be targeted in future intervention studies. The long-term impact will include setting the stage for clinical trials of interventions to prevent or treat HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders in children and adolescents. Project Narrative As a consequence of the widespread availability of antiretroviral therapy, HIV in children and adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa is evolving from a universally fatal illness into a chronic condition, often complicated by comorbidities including depression, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive impairment. However, there are few longitudinal studies assessing these comorbidities in children and adolescents in low-resource settings. This prospective study of Zambian children and adolescents will identify risk factors and biomarkers for HIV- associated comorbidities that will set the stage for future clinical trials.",Longitudinal

"The science for the last mile: Enhanced epidemiologic surveillance to accelerate HIV elimination PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cities account for a large proportion of the global population of people living with HIV. As a result, Cities have become the focus of UNAIDS's “Fast Track” approach to ending the AIDS epidemic through targeted scale-up of prevention and testing services. In the United States, HIV surveillance data indicates a shifting composition of the population of people newly infected with HIV, with females and minority populations accounting for disproportionate rates of infection. These emerging health disparities in HIV incidence suggest that the largely successful “Getting to Zero” public health initiatives (e.g. rapid expansion of pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP], needle exchange and safe injecting sites, etc.) are not reaching the most vulnerable populations. Leveraging routinely collected surveillance data paired with primary data collection, the major goal of this research is to identify the residual drivers of HIV infection in Fast Track cities, using San Francisco as a test case. This proposal seeks to provide multidisciplinary methodological and theoretical training to investigate the scientific knowledge gap of ongoing HIV transmission in the era of “Getting to Zero.” The proposed training areas are: (1) semi-parametric statistical modeling and machine learning in order to improve the accuracy and precision of population size estimation methods; (2) molecular epidemiology and phylogenetic techniques to assess the relatedness of HIV viral sequences between individuals, inferring a shared source of infection; and (3) minority stress theory to measure the (socio-structural) characteristics of the environment and relate these structural exposures to disparities in HIV infection. Aligned with the training components, the research goals of this study are to: (a) estimate how many people are living with HIV in San Francisco and quantify the magnitude of disparities in infection rates and access to health care services; (b) identify the sociodemographic correlates of membership to a transmission cluster; and (c) identify the socio-structural facilitators of recent HIV infections, particularly among minority populations, using a case-control study design. The evidence generated from this work could have a direct impact on San Francisco's Getting to Zero campaign and inform novel intervention targets for other Fast Track cities. Additionally, the exceptional methodological and practical experience gained from this project will position the candidate for an impactful career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cities account for a large proportion of HIV prevalence and incidence, and therefore are the focus of UNAIDS' “Fast Track” approach to ending the AIDS epidemic. Several “Fast Track Cities”, including San Francisco, CA, have achieved significant reductions in new HIV infections, and yet despite this success racial/ethnic and gender disparities in new infections are emerging. The proposed study will use semi-parametric statistical modeling and HIV phylogenetics applied to routinely collected public health surveillance data, paired with primary data collection informed by a minority stress theoretical framework, to identify the residual drivers of HIV infection and offer novel targets for intervention to achieve zero new infections.",The science for the last mile:

"MRI data fusion to investigate effects of drug abuse on HIV neurological complications Project Summary  Despite widespread use of antiretroviral therapy, nearly half of the 1.2 million Americans living with HIV experience neurocognitive impairments (NCI) that negatively impact daily functioning. HIV-associated NCI is estimated to be the most common form of midlife NCI worldwide. Drug abuse, a highly prevalent comorbidity in HIV+ persons, increases the risk of HIV-associated NCI. Unimodal MRI studies have shown that HIV and drug abuse are each linked with a distinct set of structural and functional alterations in the brain, but how they interact is not well understood. Conventional unimodal analyses are limited in their ability to characterize complex neuropsychiatric diseases because each modality provides an incomplete view of the brain. In contrast, we propose to use innovative fusion approaches that exploit the richness of multimodal data to discover covariations across multiple neuroimaging modalities and cognitive measures simultaneously. This proposal capitalizes on existing data from 3 completed NIDA-funded projects on the neurobehavioral effects of HIV and drug abuse. When combined, the dataset will consist of 217 unique cases (108 HIV+ and 109 HIV-) with in-depth substance use histories, multimodal brain images (i.e., structural, diffusion, and resting-state functional MRI), comprehensive neurocognitive batteries, and a wide range of other phenotypic data. The central hypothesis is that HIV-specific co-alterations in gray matter volume and white matter integrity shape neural functioning and in turn NCI, and that cocaine use worsens these alterations due to its long-term effects on neural circuitry. Using complementary multimodal analyses (supervised fusion and connectomics), we aim to: (1) identify neural biomarkers of HIV neurological disease and associated NCI; and (2) test cocaine as a moderator of HIV-specific co-alterations in brain structure and function and associated NCI. In addition, the project will develop new, advanced methods to improve MRI data quality for cross-study harmonization and to optimize the prediction of NCI based on multimodal indices. This amalgamated dataset provides an unprecedented opportunity to test new and clinically important hypotheses about the neural substrates of HIV- associated NCI in the context of drug abuse. The proposal responds directly to the need for research to “characterize brain morphology or function that is aberrant as a consequence of chronic drug use” and “[its role] in the evolving dynamics of HIV/AIDS pathogenesis, treatment, prevention, and service delivery” [PAR- 16-234]. This research also addresses high priority topics for AIDS-designated funding, including investigation of neurological complications [NOT-15-137]. Building upon a sound premise and robust preliminary data, this innovative project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers of neuroHIV that may facilitate diagnosis and treatment monitoring in active drug users and serve as targets for clinical interventions to mitigate the burden caused by HIV-associated NCI. Public Health Relevance  Nearly half of HIV-infected Americans experience neurocognitive impairments that impact daily functioning, and the prevalence is even higher among persons who are addicted to stimulant drugs. Using innovative multimodal data fusion approaches, this study will identify the distinct and shared neural signatures of HIV neurological disease and cocaine use disorder that are predictive of neurocognitive impairment.

"Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in patient-oriented HIV research, seven of whom have secured K funding and four of whom are now R-funded . She is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. Her mentees will have access to a wealth of research opportunities in the context of the many large HIV-focused clinical trials and studies that Dr. Lockman leads (and led over the past 18 years) in Botswana and elsewhere, ranging from randomized trials of antiretroviral or antibiotic regimens (many in pregnant women and their infants) to observational and epidemiologic studies of clinical outcomes among HIV-infected adults and HIV-exposed children. In the proposed K24, she will leverage the unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a large ongoing randomized HIV combination prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000 with longitudinal cohort of 12,000 adults), in order to mentor investigators from Botswana and the US on pressing questions of substantial public health and clinical relevance to the severe epidemic still affecting sub-Saharan Africa. For context, UNAIDS is promoting high levels (90% or greater) of HIV diagnosis, antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage, and virologic suppression (“90-90-90” targets) to end the HIV epidemic. However, despite nearly meeting these targets in Botswana, we observe annual HIV incidence >1%. Furthermore, with more than 15% of the adult population of Botswana on ART (and recent implementation of universal ART), it is essential that we understand the implications of widespread treatment for clinical outcomes and non-communicable disease incidence in persons living with HIV at the population level. We will therefore: a) Characterize adults with recent HIV infection using predictive analysis, in order to identify groups at highest risk for HIV acquisition in the current epidemic, and augment our understanding with individual in-depth interviews with recently- infected adults; b) Study the feasibility, acceptability, and uptake of a targeted approach to TDF/FTC pre- exposure prophylaxis, offered to HIV-negative persons meeting this high-risk profile; c) Evaluate the impact of HIV (and of early ART) on clinical outcomes, including c ancer incidence and hypertension prevalence in HIV-infected vs. HIV-uninfected adults, and HIV-related outcomes among persons starting dolutegravir- vs. efavirenz-based ART. In addition, Dr. Lockman will also mentor junior investigators on projects nested within a new large randomized IMPAACT trial of 3 antiretroviral regimens in pregnancy that that she leads, and in prior large perinatal HIV studies in Botswana that enrolled more than 9,000 mother-infant pairs. This K24 is critical, to support the protected time and resources that are required for Dr. Lockman to mentor junior investigators from both the US and Botswana in patient-oriented research. NARRATIVE Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in global patient-oriented HIV research (many of whom have gone on to conduct funded research of their own), and is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. In this project, she will harness unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a randomized HIV prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000), in order to study questions of major public health importance in the new reality of universal antiretroviral treatment (regardless of HIV disease stage)--namely, whether it is feasible and acceptable to identify and offer proven HIV prevention interventions to HIV-negative persons at high risk for acquiring HIV; and what the longer-term health implications of HIV (and of universal treatment) are, for the health of HIV-infected and –uninfected people (including hypertension and cancer risk).",Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial,9873904,K24AI131928,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Botswana ', ' Bechuanaland ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Male Circumcision ', ' Circumcision ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemic ', ' Faculty ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HIV-1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Household ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Mothers ', ' Persons ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' virology ', ' Measures ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Viread ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Country ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' cancer risk ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' antiretroviral ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' efavirenz ', ' treatment program ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' emtricitabine ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' trial regimen ', ' trial treatment ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' point of care ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' community intervention ', ' Outcome ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' high risk ', ' HIV prevention trial ', ' population based ', ' IMPAACT ', ' International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Regimen ', ' Secure ', ' Prevention trial ', ' trial design ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' perinatal HIV ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2020,188938,0.380206186955001
"Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1 Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health. Project Narrative  This project aims at developing next-generation neutralization fingerprinting algorithms for the analysis of antibody specificities in polyclonal responses against HIV-1. Overall, this work will build a more complete picture of the broadly neutralizing antibody epitopes on Env, and will lead to a better understanding of the antibody responses against HIV-1 both at the individual and population levels. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health.",Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1,9936138,R01AI131722,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Monoclonal Antibodies ', ' Clinical Treatment Moab ', ' mAbs ', ' Antibody Specificity ', ' Epitopes ', ' Antigenic Determinants ', ' Binding Determinants ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Goals ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' hep C ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV-1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Least-Squares Analysis ', ' Least Squares ', ' Least-Squares Analyses ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Epitope Mapping ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' polyclonal antibody ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' neutralizing antibody ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Influenza C ', ' Influenza Viruses Type C ', ' Influenzavirus C ', ' Orthomyxoviruses Type C ', ' Influenza C Virus ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Address ', ' Donor Screening ', ' Donor Selection ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Collection ', ' computational analyses ', ' computational analysis ', ' computer analyses ', ' Computer Analysis ', ' Vaccine Design ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Knockout ', ' Knock-out ', ' Derivation ', ' Derivation procedure ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' health economics ', ' HIV1 vaccine ', ' HIV-1 vaccine ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Algorithmic Analyses ', ' Analyses of Algorithms ', ' Analysis of Algorithms ', ' Algorithmic Analysis ', ' Antibody Response ', ' ']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,617708,0.10999712608725956
"Optimizing outcomes at the intersection of HIV and mental health: Prediction, precision medicine, and population health PROJECT SUMMARY  Psychiatric disorders and substance misuse are prevalent among people with HIV (PWH) and have negative effects on HIV control. These conditions impose substantial emotional and physical burdens, impede the achievement of virologic suppression, and are associated with behaviors that increase the risk of transmission. While it is common for PWH to have multiple psychiatric diagnoses, relatively little is known about the ways in which combinations of psychiatric symptoms and substance misuse behaviors confer elevated risk for poor HIV control, or how to personalize the management of these commonly co-occurring disorders. Furthermore, estimates of the potential public-health impact of mental health service innovations on the HIV epidemic are generally lacking. Recent innovations in statistics and machine learning make it possible to harness complex data to identify patterns of psychiatric disease in PWH and tailor psychiatric therapy to optimize HIV control in ways that classical statistical approaches cannot.  The candidate is a translational and computational investigator and general internal medicine physician at Johns Hopkins University with a background in computer science and biostatistics. During this award period, he will be mentored by a team whose expertise spans HIV care, psychiatric epidemiology, machine learning, population-level HIV modeling, and personalized medicine. The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent, translational researcher who applies innovative statistical and machine learning approaches to improve the health of individuals and populations at the intersection of HIV and mental health.  The overarching objective for this project is to address psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in the context of the HIV continuum of care by developing models that leverage complex data to inform patient care and public policy. Three aims will be undertaken: (1) to identify how combinations of symptoms of depression and anxiety and misuse of alcohol, cocaine, opioids, marijuana, and amphetamines impact individual-level HIV control; (2) to use repeated patient-reported measures of depression, anxiety, and substance misuse to predict future mental health and HIV control under a potential pharmacotherapies; and (3) to develop population models that project the impact of mental health service interventions on HIV incidence and mortality. The models will leverage data from the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS), a racially diverse, multi-site cohort of over 31,000 PWH.  This mentored research will be accompanied by relevant skills training in mental health epidemiology, the care of PWH, and advanced Bayesian and machine-learning methods. Collectively, this research and career development training will provide a clear pathway to an independent career as a clinical investigator focused on optimizing the management of psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in PWH at both the individual and population level. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric comorbidities and substance misuse present major obstacles for many persons with HIV in achieving virologic suppression, with negative consequences for both individual and population health. I propose to address psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in the context of the HIV continuum of care by developing innovative models that leverage complex patient data (1) to guide the care of individual persons with HIV and mental illness and (2) to inform policy decisions about systems-level interventions in mental health. As part of a mentored research training program, this award will allow me to become a leading independent researcher with the expertise to leverage complex individual- and population-level data to optimize the health of individuals and populations with HIV who suffer from mental illness.","Optimizing outcomes at the intersection of HIV and mental health: Prediction, precision medicine, and

"Big Data analytics of HIV treatment gaps in South Carolina: Identification and prediction Project Summary/Abstract. Early HIV diagnosis as well as linkage into and retention in HIV medical care for HIV+ individuals is important for patient survival and treatment. Missed opportunities for early HIV diagnosis continues even with recommended routine HIV testing. National and South Carolina (SC) estimates of retention in HIV medical care are slightly above fifty percent, indicating a gap in HIV treatment. With significant proportions of HIV+ individuals not receiving HIV medical care, improved outcomes of care and HIV prevention as part of national HIV/AIDs strategies are difficult to achieve. The purpose of this study is to use novel machine learning algorithms to further explore, identify, characterize, and explain predictors of missed opportunities for HIV medical care utilization among all living HIV+ individuals in SC. Profiles of HIV+ individuals based on their patterns of HIV medical care seeking behavior will be developed with concomitant identification of both gaps in HIV care and missed opportunities for reengagement into HIV care. Health utilization behavior for HIV+ individuals' pre-HIV diagnosis also will be studied to identify where missed opportunities for HIV testing occurs. Findings will be integrated with the ongoing effort of the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC)'s Data-to-Care (DTC) program as well as the Ryan White Care Program. The public health value that HIV treatment brings includes improved survival outcomes of care among HIV+ individuals as well as reduced HIV transmission. These important components form part of the overall strategy for fighting and controlling the HIV epidemic in the United States and aligns closely with the strategic goals of reducing new HIV infections. Using state-level CD4 and Viral Load (VL) testing data available for all SC HIV+ individuals since 2004, the study will link inpatient and outpatient claims data sources, the state electronic HIV/AIDS reporting system, Area Health Resource Files, and data from the state corrections database to create a unique population based dataset spanning 10 years (2004-2013). Advanced Big Data analytical algorithms will be used to create person-level profile patterns of pre- and post- HIV diagnosis health utilization behaviors and for identifying best predictors of linkage and retention in HIV medical care. These algorithms will be useful in unearthing hidden features/predictors of HIV medical care utilization. A predictive model useful for predicting where HIV+ individuals who are not in care will access routine medical care (missed opportunities) also will be developed. Findings will provide fresh guidance for public health interventions targeting early HIV testing and linkage to and retention in HIV medical care for SC HIV-infected individuals. Project Narrative. Treatment as a public health strategy of HIV prevention is important in fighting the national HIV epidemic. Early diagnosis, linkage to, and retention in HIV medical care are key public health strategies for HIV prevention. Missed opportunities for HIV diagnosis as well as inadequate HIV medical care utilization by HIV+ individuals in South Carolina negatively impacts HIV survival outcomes, while increasing population transmission risks. The analyses of population-based health utilization data for HIV+ individuals using powerful machine learning techniques such as deep learning algorithms will generate new factors useful for improving retention in HIV care. This valuable new information will be translated into ongoing efforts such as SC's Data-to Care and Ryan White care efforts through improved targeting of HIV medical care engagement and reengagement interventions.",Big Data analytics of HIV treatment gaps in South Carolina: Identification and prediction,9944437,R01AI127203,"['Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Awareness ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Dropout ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Resources ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Inpatients ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Manuals ', ' Persons ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' South Carolina ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Immunology ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' fighting ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' care seeking ', ' intervention program ', ' novel ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Drops ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Predictive Value ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' surveillance data ', ' public health intervention ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' improved outcome ', ' survival outcome ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' Big Data Analytics ', ' Big Data Tools ', ' Big Data Methods ', ' big-data science ', ' treatment research ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2020,589629,0.40224731787593315
