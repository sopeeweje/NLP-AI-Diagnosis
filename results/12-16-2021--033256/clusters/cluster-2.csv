"NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE ANALYSIS We will use a combination of computer programming and biochemistry to study some interesting questions in molecular biology.  Our nucleic-acid sequence library system will be improved to allow the user the powers of recombinant DNA technology available to the biochemist.  All of our software will be extensively modularized to facilitate program development and transportation, both of which will hasten improvements.  We will continue to expand our collection of programs to analyze sequence-function relationships.  This will include improvements to our program of a pattern recognition algorithm (the ""perceptron"") and adaptations of multiple regression analyses to nucleic-acid sequence problems.  These techniques will be used to make quantitative models for sequence effects on promoter efficiency and mutagenicity.  We will generate a large collection of data for sequence effects on translational initiation efficiency using the technologies of recombinant DNA, chemical DNA sysnthesis and DNA sequencing.  These data, analyzed by our computer programs, will lead to a quantitative understanding of translational initiation.

"NUCLEAR DNA AND MORPHOMETRIC STUDIES OF GYNECOLOGIC CANC The goals of this project are to improve our understanding of carcinogenesis in gynecologic cancers and to enhance diagnostic and prognostic accuracies using quantitative analyses.  During the past year, a close relationship between human papillomavirus infection (genital warts, condylomas) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (squamous dysplasias and carcinomas in situ) has been confirmed by nuclear DNA quantitation, immunoperoxidase stain for human papillomavirus capsid antigens, and morphologic analyses.  Using these techniques, it is possible to demonstrate a transition from cervical condyloma to neoplasia.  This occurrence is supported by the coexistence of papillomavirus capsid antigens and aneuploid DNA patterns in 14% of cervical condylomatous lesions.  The risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is increased in flat rather than exophytic condylomas, and in condylomas with moderate as compared to mild degree of nuclear atypia.  These findings support the recent molecular hybridization studies indicating that several types of human papillomaviruses with different oncogenicities exist in the female genital tract.  In 51 patients with clinical stage I or II cervical adenocarcinoma, the survival is most reliably predicted by the standard deviation of nuclear size (p=0.002), the DNA ploidy level (p=0.003), the clinical stage (p=0.0072), the percentage of glandular lumen (p=0.0074), the mean nuclear size (p=0.04), and the histologic grade (p=0.09).

"NOVEL PROBES FOR EFFICIENT GENETIC DISEASE DIAGNOSIS Current techniques for the diagnosis of genetic disease are limited by an inability to detect the majority of mutations and polymorphisms in DNA. DNA molecules which differ by one or a few base pairs can most efficiently be distinguished currently by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis due to sequence specific differences in melting properties of the DNA. However, base changes can be detected only in domains of the molecule which melt first in these gels.  We propose to improve this technique so that base pair changes can be detected in all domains of a DNA molecule.  We will modify DNA probes in ways that will significantly alter the melting behavior of DNA hybrids, so that new regions of the DNA molecule will be included in the first melting domain.  In addition, we will use experimental data to generate computer models to predict melting behavior of modified DNA molecules.  These computer programs can then be used to design optimal probes for detecting sequence changes in any DNA molecule. This technology should be broad enough for application to any gene of interest, and could lead to the commercial development of diagnostic tests for a number of genetic diseases.

"AUTOMATION OF DNA SEQUENCE DATA ENTRY DNA sequence determination has become a standard method for the characterization of newly isolated genes.  Recent advances in the technology for the determination of DNA sequences have allowed large amounts of data to accumulate rapidly.  However, methods for transferring that data into the computer, where it is to be analysed, are still far from ideal, in that they require considerable manual interention.  We propose to develop a highly automated system that will greatly increase the accuracy and the speed with which sequence data can be collected and analysed.  The method requires first producing a digital image of the sequencing radioautogram.  Algorithms will then be devised that are able to convert that ditigized data into a DNA sequence.  A key feature of the software for this interpretative step is that it will operate according to a set of heuristic procedures that are clearly defined and which can easily be modified and extended.  When these rules fail to provide an unambiguous interpretion then operator assistance will be requested to make a final decision.  An important consequence of the strategy is that the primary data upon which the DNA sequence depends will be available in machine-readable form.  Appropriate software will be developed to manage this primary data and to assist in the resolution of discrepancies that may arise during the course of a sequencing project.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION IN NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE DATABASES The proposed work focuses on searching large nucleic acid sequence databases for functionally, structurally, and evolutionarily significant patterns.  There is a need to develop efficient and biologically relevant strategies for defining higher- order patterns and for using the defined pattern as a basis for searches through nucleic acid sequence databases (e.g., the GenBank database).  We will design and install on the Cray computer an improved set of algorithms that will:  (1) use a hash function to rapidly scan large databases for evidence of local similarity; (2) use a rigorous measure to find and score the best local alignments; (3) dynamically filter significant scores; and (4) store the results of the scan in a dynamically maintained database of similarity scores.  The increased speed and reduced cost of these algorithms will allow us to examine in greater detail variations in measures (on both nucleic acid and protein levels) of similarity; the programs will be well suited to the large-scale sequence comparison projects being planned for the Crays becoming available to the molecular biology research community.  We will develop an improved method for recognizing potential donor and acceptor sites for intron sequences.  We will re- examine the notion of ""consensus sequence"" donor and acceptor patterns as well as define additional attributes that distinguish these patterns.  These measures will be combined through discriminant analysis to create an algorithm that predicts whether or not a potential donor or acceptor site is functional.  We will develop a general approach for scanning large databases for structural patterns, initially in the context of a search for potential curved DNA sequences.  First we will develop useful measures for gauging curvature in DNA, and then test the predictions of the Tung-Harvey model by comparison with experimental results for curved DNA.  With the established measures and model, we will scan the GenBank database for anomalously curved regions, and determine whether or not they are correlated with the functional roles of coincident or neighboring sequences.

"SYMBOLIC SIMULATION OF DNA METABOLISM Using established methods of knowledge representation and rule- based expert systems I propose to develop a symbolic simulation of DNA metabolism.  Rule-based expert systems permit simulations of DNA metabolism which can predict the activity of both individual enzymes and of entire pathways under a wide variety of physiological conditions.  Both classical production rules and an assumption-based truth maintenance system will be used.  Rule-based methods have the intrinsic property of being able to explain conclusions using English sentences or graphic representations of the pattern of inference.  The enzymes, substrates and products will also be represented in a frame-based knowledge system.  Knowledge based systems facilitate the description of product-precursor relationships between different metabolites as well as the complete pathway.  Physiological conditions such as the presence of salts, nucleotides, temperature, ionic strength, pH, etc. will be presented graphically as active images of thermometers, gauges and switches.  All environmental and substrate conditions can be changed by using a mouse pointing device.  In response to changes of any parameter, a series of rules defining the specificity and reactivity of enzymes are automatically invoked and specific conclusions are made. The methods for specifying the actions of enzymes are well defined, allowing ready simulation of other enzymes.  Simulations of individual enzymatic steps can be coupled together to generate a discrete event simulation of the entire metabolic pathway.

The method will combine Dr. Myers' new algorithm for the very fast identification of matches to a pattern allowing some number of mismatches, with improvements to an analysis and display method previously developed by the PI and Dr. Ehrenfeucht.  We expect that the method will give quantitative, graphical information about repeated patterns (allowing for some differences between instances of the patterns) that can be used to identify important features in the sequences that are typical of known functional domains of DNA and proteins.

"GENETIC DATABASES--APPLICATIONS FOR MACHINE LEARNING Recent advances in neural network theory, in which the present authors have played a significant role, have resulted in machine learning algorithms of great power.  In an initial investigation, the authors have applied these algorithms to detecting and exploiting pattern regularities in DNA and also in amino acid sequences.  In the two situations considered thus far (determination of whether or not a fragment of DNA codes for a protein, and predicting protein secondary structure given amino acid sequence) the results of the neural net analysis technique equals or exceeds results of conventional methods.  We propose to intensively investigate these two problems with the goal of verifying and expanding our initial results, particularly to DNA sequences of other species, especially humans.  We plan to expand our investigations to include pattern recognition searches for promoter/terminator sequences, intron/exon splice junctions, and other regulatory signals.  Methods for the sequence to structure problem will be extended to include new results in energy minimization techniques for analogue models that contain numerous local minima.  Different network architectures and different representations for the data will be investigated.  When a neural net method exceeds a conventional method in accuracy we plan to analyze the network connections with the goal of understanding what rules the network developed (by virtue of the learning algorithm) that yielded the increased accuracy.  Other machine learning algorithms, such as ""classifier systems,"" will also be applied, as well as new approaches to information theoretic constructions of default hierarchies.

"SYMBOLIC SIMULATION OF DNA METABOLISM Using established methods of knowledge representation and rule- based expert systems I propose to develop a symbolic simulation of DNA metabolism.  Rule-based expert systems permit simulations of DNA metabolism which can predict the activity of both individual enzymes and of entire pathways under a wide variety of physiological conditions.  Both classical production rules and an assumption-based truth maintenance system will be used.  Rule-based methods have the intrinsic property of being able to explain conclusions using English sentences or graphic representations of the pattern of inference.  The enzymes, substrates and products will also be represented in a frame-based knowledge system.  Knowledge based systems facilitate the description of product-precursor relationships between different metabolites as well as the complete pathway.  Physiological conditions such as the presence of salts, nucleotides, temperature, ionic strength, pH, etc. will be presented graphically as active images of thermometers, gauges and switches.  All environmental and substrate conditions can be changed by using a mouse pointing device.  In response to changes of any parameter, a series of rules defining the specificity and reactivity of enzymes are automatically invoked and specific conclusions are made. The methods for specifying the actions of enzymes are well defined, allowing ready simulation of other enzymes.  Simulations of individual enzymatic steps can be coupled together to generate a discrete event simulation of the entire metabolic pathway.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION IN NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE DATABASES The proposed work focuses on searching large nucleic acid sequence databases for functionally, structurally, and evolutionarily significant patterns.  There is a need to develop efficient and biologically relevant strategies for defining higher- order patterns and for using the defined pattern as a basis for searches through nucleic acid sequence databases (e.g., the GenBank database).  We will design and install on the Cray computer an improved set of algorithms that will:  (1) use a hash function to rapidly scan large databases for evidence of local similarity; (2) use a rigorous measure to find and score the best local alignments; (3) dynamically filter significant scores; and (4) store the results of the scan in a dynamically maintained database of similarity scores.  The increased speed and reduced cost of these algorithms will allow us to examine in greater detail variations in measures (on both nucleic acid and protein levels) of similarity; the programs will be well suited to the large-scale sequence comparison projects being planned for the Crays becoming available to the molecular biology research community.  We will develop an improved method for recognizing potential donor and acceptor sites for intron sequences.  We will re- examine the notion of ""consensus sequence"" donor and acceptor patterns as well as define additional attributes that distinguish these patterns.  These measures will be combined through discriminant analysis to create an algorithm that predicts whether or not a potential donor or acceptor site is functional.  We will develop a general approach for scanning large databases for structural patterns, initially in the context of a search for potential curved DNA sequences.  First we will develop useful measures for gauging curvature in DNA, and then test the predictions of the Tung-Harvey model by comparison with experimental results for curved DNA.

"MOLECULAR TYPING AND SEQUENCING OF HLA CLASS I ALLELES The overall objective for this proposal is to develop a system for HLA phenotyping for the HLA-A, -B, -C antigens based on nucleotide sequence variations in the coding region of the individual HLA alleles. Conventional serological typing for HLA does not detect all known HLA alleles.  Serological techniques supplemented by cellular assays for histocompatibility testing or biochemical detection of the HLA gene products by isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis or by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis are impractical for routine applications in clinical histocompatibility testing, and many HLA alleles are still undetected.  Recent progress in the definition of HLA alleles by their unique combination of nucleotide sequences provide an extensive database from which a DNA-based HLA typing system can be developed.  The application of gene specific DNA amplification utilizing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with sequence specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOP) and allele specific oligonucleotide probes (ASOP) have made it possible to develop HLA typing procedures for HLA class II alleles encoded by the DRB, DQA, DQB, DPA and DPB genes.  A similar systematic approach for DNA-based allele specific typing for HLA-A, -B and -C genes has not yet been developed.  The present proposal focuses on the development of a PCR-based DNA typing procedure with SSOP and ASOP. Presently available nucleotide sequence data for more than sixty HLA-A, -B and -C alleles will be used within the first specific aim to design a system for HLA class I typing.  Universal and locus specific primers will be designed for the HLA-A, -B and -C alleles and optimal conditions for their application will be determined.  A series of SSOPs and ASOPs will be developed and conditions for a uniform hybridization pattern will be determined.  The hybridization pattern will be evaluated on an HLA well-defined highly selected cell panel and a computer algorism to assist in allele assignment will be designed.  The second specific aim concerns the determination of nucleotide sequences for HLA-A, -B and -C variants which can be detected by 1D-IEF.  Full-length cDNA clones encoding the class I genes will be obtained using a PCR-based technology.  An expres- sion vector which can be used for sequencing as well as transfection will be used for cloning.  The cDNA clones will be expressed in a human B cell line deficient for its HLA class I antigen expression and the HLA specificity of the isolated gene will be determined by 1D-IEF. Nucleotide sequence data obtained within specific aim #2 together with other novel sequences reported will be included in the database and applied for refining the SSOP and ASOP developed in the first specific aim.

"TRANSLATION OF AUTOMATED SEQUENCER DATA TO DNA SEQUENCES The objective of this proposal is to significantly improve automated determination of DNA sequences.  Practical performance limits of automated DNA sequencers are determined by the separation of oligonucleotides effected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.  Designs of contemporary instruments are basically similar.  As oligomers in a DNA sequencing ladder pass the detector(s), multi-component analysis specifies the radioactive or fluorescent label associated with each oligomer.  Under ideal conditions, determination of the sequence of terminal nucleotides is straightforward.  When separations of oligomers or signal levels are not optimal, ambiguities or errors are likely.  These are miscalled bases, extra or missing bases, or unidentified bases in the DNA sequence file, typically at about 1 to 3 errors per 100 bases.  An error rate near 1% is a common target for DNA sequencing performance, since comparison with complementary strand sequence data should then reduce errors to about 1 per 10,000 base pairs.  This is only possible if every mismatch of the sequence and its complement is identified and correctly reconciled.  Even then, error rates from 0.01% to 0.1% approximate the variation among alleles in a gene pool: some such alleles can correlate with severe burdens of inherited pathology.  Small improvements in single strand error rate will have substantial impact on quality of finished sequences from 1/10,000 bp to 1/1,000,000 bp. Improvements are needed if automated systems are to provide longer spans of DNA sequences with fewer errors.  The emphasis of this proposal is on raw data acquisition and new methods for translation of the raw data to finished DNA sequences.  An expert system, rule-based method will be developed to reinforce conventional translation of raw data to DNA sequences.  An independent, pattern-recognition system will also be developed and tested, using techniques for construction and training of neural nets.  We will also evaluate two new approaches to utilize single label, single data channels for more efficient determination of DNA sequences.  Alternative approaches to oligonucleotide separation for sequence analysis will also be investigated.  In pursuit of these specific aims we will take advantage of the relative separations and intensities of successive oligomers in DNA sequencing ladders, as independent determinants of DNA sequence-specific data stream patterns.

"COMPUTER ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF PROTEIN STRUCTURE      The amino acid sequence of a protein uniquely determines its tertiary structure.  Deciphering this relationship, the protein folding problem, has become increasingly important to molecular biologists.  DNA sequencing has become routine, but structural experiments remain very difficult. Computational strategies are needed to help address this problem.       This proposal describes a strategy to identify the location of alpha-helices and beta-strands throughout the sequence.  A rationale is offered for employing neural networks and pattern based algorithms to address the secondary structure prediction problem.  Once secondary structure is located, computational methods exist for generating plausible tertiary structures.  However, these combinatorial strategies give rise to a large number of alternative structures which are difficult to distinguish from the correct fold.  Simplified potential functions are proposed as a method for overcoming this structure evaluation problem.  The properties of a non-lattice based simplified representation of a polypeptide chain will be explored to aid in the construction of an appropriate simplified potential function. Collaborative ventures are planned to experimentally test the merits of existing algorithms for predicting protein structure.       In collaboration with Dr. Bunn at Harvard, the relationship of the erythropoietin sequence to its structure and function will be explored.

"EFFICIENT SOFTWARE FOR THE ANALYSIS OF BIOSEQUENCES We propose to design efficient computer algorithms providing novel and/or improved methods and software for a number of computational problems in molecular biology.  the emphasis will b eon blending theoretical results with practical concerns.  All software emerging from the project will be made available free of charge.  The proposal and the principal investigator's current research efforts are divided into three projects.  The first project centers on computational problems in the physical mapping and sequencing of DNA.  We propose to continue refining a software system for the fragment assembly problem, i.e., determine the most likely complete DNA sequence consistent with electrophoresis data gathered from cloned fragments.  The refinements consist of improved algorithms for a number of the phases of the computation, expanding the functionality to support user- interaction, and developing a complete environment to support megabase sequencing projects.  The methods we developed for fragment assembly also apply in large part to the problem of determining physical maps via various fingerprinting techniques.  We have formulated a generalized assembly problem and plan to build a system that is capable of solving such problems for any combination of restriction map, digest, and hybridization information about the clones.  The second project is to design algorithms for a number of computational problems arising in molecular biology.  Progress in this arena tends to be inspired rather than calculated.  We demonstrate our track record of producing interesting results and then describe the following problems for which we have a number of ideas and preliminary results:  sublinear similarity searches, restriction map comparison, super pattern matching (gene recognition), determining restriction maps from digest data, designing oligonucleotide probes, and RNA secondary structure prediction.  The objective of the last project is to develop a pattern matching system permitting the expression of complex patterns and their reduction to efficient search strategies.  The pattern specification language is simple yet powerful enough to succinctly express the most complex patterns of biological interest.  An ""expert system"" compiler for the language will examine a pattern and will choose a search strategy or combination of strategies from a built-in library of basic search techniques.  The build- in library will contain implementations of the best available search algorithms for exact and approximate matches to keywords, repeats, and regular expressions.  Using a dynamic-programming style calculation the expert compiler chooses the optimal backtracking strategy over the basic library searches.  We have proven the efficacy of this approach on a small prototype for a subset of the language that is useful for specifying protein motifs.  We now propose to embark upon the construction of a complete system.

"THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF DNA SUPERHELICAL EQUILIBRIA This research program will develop accurate theoretical methods for analyzing secondary structural equilibria in superhelical DNA molecules of kilobase length and specified sequence, in which all transitions compete to which the sequence is susceptible.  These include B-Z transitions, cruciform extrusions, B-H transitions, and strand separation.  Methods also will be developed for handling local sequence effects, known to occur in practice, that complicate the energetics of transitions and the calculation of equilibria.  Examples include chemical adducts, abasic sites or other disruptions of base pairing, and imperfect susceptible sequences such as imprecise inverted repeat symmetry or purine-pyrimidine alternation.  Methods based on Monte Carlo techniques will be developed for the analysis of superhelical secondary structural transitions at high temperatures or in extremely long DNA sequences (approximately 105 base pairs).  Monte Carlo methods also will be developed to analyze the interplay between transitions and bending deformations in superhelical  DNA molecules.  Transition state theories of the kinetics of superhelical transconformation reactions will be developed and tested against available data.  Collaborations with several experimental groups will illuminate roles that superhelical DNA conformational transitions play in normal and pathological processes. These include projects examining:  1) the role of superhelical strand separation in the initiation of replication; 2) mechanisms by which superhelicity enhances DNA sensitivity to single strand breakage by x- rays, and; 3) superhelical cruciform formation at orthopoxviral telomere sequences and its role in replication.  The analytic techniques developed in this research will be used to deduce from experimental data the values of important energetic and conformational parameters governing superhelical transitions.

"TRANSLATION OF AUTOMATED SEQUENCER DATA TO DNA SEQUENCES The objective of this proposal is to significantly improve automated determination of DNA sequences.  Practical performance limits of automated DNA sequencers are determined by the separation of oligonucleotides effected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.  Designs of contemporary instruments are basically similar.  As oligomers in a DNA sequencing ladder pass the detector(s), multi-component analysis specifies the radioactive or fluorescent label associated with each oligomer.  Under ideal conditions, determination of the sequence of terminal nucleotides is straightforward.  When separations of oligomers or signal levels are not optimal, ambiguities or errors are likely.  These are miscalled bases, extra or missing bases, or unidentified bases in the DNA sequence file, typically at about 1 to 3 errors per 100 bases.  An error rate near 1% is a common target for DNA sequencing performance, since comparison with complementary strand sequence data should then reduce errors to about 1 per 10,000 base pairs.  This is only possible if every mismatch of the sequence and its complement is identified and correctly reconciled.  Even then, error rates from 0.01% to 0.1% approximate the variation among alleles in a gene pool: some such alleles can correlate with severe burdens of inherited pathology.  Small improvements in single strand error rate will have substantial impact on quality of finished sequences from 1/10,000 bp to 1/1,000,000 bp. Improvements are needed if automated systems are to provide longer spans of DNA sequences with fewer errors.  The emphasis of this proposal is on raw data acquisition and new methods for translation of the raw data to finished DNA sequences.  An expert system, rule-based method will be developed to reinforce conventional translation of raw data to DNA sequences.  An independent, pattern-recognition system will also be developed and tested, using techniques for construction and training of neural nets.  We will also evaluate two new approaches to utilize single label, single data channels for more efficient determination of DNA sequences.  Alternative approaches to oligonucleotide separation for sequence analysis will also be investigated.  In pursuit of these specific aims we will take advantage of the relative separations and intensities of successive oligomers in DNA sequencing ladders, as independent determinants of DNA sequence-specific data stream patterns.

"SOLUTION STRUCTURE OF DNA AND DNA-PROTEIN COMPLEXES The three-dimensional structure of DNA is quite dependent on sequence.

"MOLECULAR TYPING AND SEQUENCING OF HLA CLASS I ALLELES The overall objective for this proposal is to develop a system for HLA phenotyping for the HLA-A, -B, -C antigens based on nucleotide sequence variations in the coding region of the individual HLA alleles. Conventional serological typing for HLA does not detect all known HLA alleles.  Serological techniques supplemented by cellular assays for histocompatibility testing or biochemical detection of the HLA gene products by isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis or by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis are impractical for routine applications in clinical histocompatibility testing, and many HLA alleles are still undetected.  Recent progress in the definition of HLA alleles by their unique combination of nucleotide sequences provide an extensive database from which a DNA-based HLA typing system can be developed.  The application of gene specific DNA amplification utilizing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with sequence specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOP) and allele specific oligonucleotide probes (ASOP) have made it possible to develop HLA typing procedures for HLA class II alleles encoded by the DRB, DQA, DQB, DPA and DPB genes.  A similar systematic approach for DNA-based allele specific typing for HLA-A, -B and -C genes has not yet been developed.  The present proposal focuses on the development of a PCR-based DNA typing procedure with SSOP and ASOP. Presently available nucleotide sequence data for more than sixty HLA-A, -B and -C alleles will be used within the first specific aim to design a system for HLA class I typing.  Universal and locus specific primers will be designed for the HLA-A, -B and -C alleles and optimal conditions for their application will be determined.

I believe that my background in theoretical and experimental particle physics provides me with a unique set of skills relevant to the solution of these and other problems.  The goals of this training program are to: 1) obtain a firm grounding in modern molecular biology and genetics with specialization in genome research, 2) develop a set of skills in laboratory-based genome research through a first year project in physical mapping and DNA sequencing, and 3) develop a long term project focusing on DNA sequence acquisition and analysis which will utilize the analytical, computational and model building skills which I have developed as a physicist.  In particular, I would hope to develop optimum protocols for gene mapping and sequence assembly applicable to large scale genome analysis and to develop new and more efficient algorithms for gene sequence identification and interpretation.  In addition, I intend to pursue the development of advanced automated sequencing technology based on highly sensitive detectors and techniques developed for particle physics.  Achievement of either or both of these goals will greatly facilitate the formidable task faced by the researchers involved in the Human Genome Project in accumulating and analyzing vast amounts of genomic DNA sequence.

"COMPUTER ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF PROTEIN STRUCTURE      The amino acid sequence of a protein uniquely determines its tertiary structure.  Deciphering this relationship, the protein folding problem, has become increasingly important to molecular biologists.  DNA sequencing has become routine, but structural experiments remain very difficult. Computational strategies are needed to help address this problem.       This proposal describes a strategy to identify the location of alpha-helices and beta-strands throughout the sequence.  A rationale is offered for employing neural networks and pattern based algorithms to address the secondary structure prediction problem.  Once secondary structure is located, computational methods exist for generating plausible tertiary structures.  However, these combinatorial strategies give rise to a large number of alternative structures which are difficult to distinguish from the correct fold.  Simplified potential functions are proposed as a method for overcoming this structure evaluation problem.  The properties of a non-lattice based simplified representation of a polypeptide chain will be explored to aid in the construction of an appropriate simplified potential function. Collaborative ventures are planned to experimentally test the merits of existing algorithms for predicting protein structure.       In collaboration with Dr. Bunn at Harvard, the relationship of the erythropoietin sequence to its structure and function will be explored.  In collaboration with Dr.  Wang at UCSF, the merits of a proposed structure of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase will be studied using site directed mutagenesis.

At present, however, obtaining patent protection for inventions involving recombinant DNA technology is an acknowledged bottleneck in the development of the U.S. biotechnology industry.  While much attention has been focused on the problems that occur during prosecution of patent applications, little has been focused on the quality of those applications.  This research will assess the technical feasibility of developing a knowledge-based expert system for facilitating the authoring of recombinant DNA invention disclosures.

"INTEGRATED SOLID-STATE/SOLUTION NMR STUDY OF DNA It is proposed to use a combination of solid-state and solution NMR spectroscopy to investigate the structure and dynamics of DNA and of drugs and other agents bound to DNA.  It has recently been shown that the methods for determining the conformation of the deoxyribose ring in DNA oligomers may be susceptible to errors arising from quantum-mechanical interference between dipolar cross-relaxation and the J coupling.  This J coupling is used, via the Karplus equation, to determine the conformation.  A new mathematical formalism is proposed to allow calculation of these interference effects.  A series of experiments is proposed to evaluate the seriousness of the errors resulting from a neglect of this term; methods for correct extraction of J couplings and cross-relaxation rate constants will be developed.  Solid-state NMR experiments on DNA fibers and model compounds, which originally gave the discrepant results which pointed out the existence of this interference term, will be continued, with an emphasis on observing drug binding to synthetic DNA high polymers of high molecular weight.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION FOR ANALYSIS OF MOLECULAR SEQUENCES We propose to work in the development and application of mathematical,  statistical, and computational methods for the analysis of nucleic acid  and amino acid sequence data. The long range goals can be placed into  three categories. (1) Computational analysis is essential to our  approaches to sequence data. Algorithms are being developed for shotgun  sequence assembly, to search for tandem repeats of length up to 32  basepairs, to find the consensus local alignment of an unknown region  common to an unknown subset of sequences, to study the  thermodynamic/statistical behavior of experiments that repeatedly select  and amplify DNA molecules, and to weight multiple and suboptimal sequence  alignment paths. (2) Physical mapping of DNA is important in genome  analysis. Studies include the PEP procedure to amplify single chromosomes,  PCR is a branching process including both amplification errors and  efficiency less than 1, the mathematical analysis of physical mapping  using end characterized clones, and classification of multiple solutions  of the double digest problem. (3) As sequence data increase, estimating  statistical significance becomes more central. We will develop methods for  estimating statistical significance of scores of tandem repeats, Poisson  distributional results for sequence alignment in certain cases where the  Chen-Stein method fails, the statistical distribution of correctly  inferred sequence in shotgun sequencing projects as a function of depth  and accuracy, and the growth of minimum free energy of secondary  structures of a random RNA.

"THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF DNA SUPERHELICAL EQUILIBRIA This research program will develop accurate theoretical methods for  analyzing secondary structural equilibria in superhelical DNA molecules  of kilobase length and specified sequence, in which all transitions  compete to which the sequence is susceptible.  These include B-Z  transitions, cruciform extrusions, B-H transitions, and strand  separation.  Methods also will be developed for handling local sequence  effects, known to occur in practice, that complicate the energetics of  transitions and the calculation of equilibria.  Examples include chemical  adducts, abasic sites or other disruptions of base pairing, and imperfect  susceptible sequences such as imprecise inverted repeat symmetry or  purine-pyrimidine alternation.  Methods based on Monte Carlo techniques  will be developed for the analysis of superhelical secondary structural  transitions at high temperatures or in extremely long DNA sequences  (approximately 105 base pairs).  Monte Carlo methods also will be  developed to analyze the interplay between transitions and bending  deformations in superhelical  DNA molecules.  Transition state theories  of the kinetics of superhelical transconformation reactions will be  developed and tested against available data.  Collaborations with several  experimental groups will illuminate roles that superhelical DNA  conformational transitions play in normal and pathological processes.  These include projects examining:  1) the role of superhelical strand  separation in the initiation of replication; 2) mechanisms by which  superhelicity enhances DNA sensitivity to single strand breakage by x-  rays, and; 3) superhelical cruciform formation at orthopoxviral telomere  sequences and its role in replication.  The analytic techniques developed  in this research will be used to deduce from experimental data the values  of important energetic and conformational parameters governing  superhelical transitions.  The effects of sequence modifications and  imperfections on the energetics of superhelical transitions will be found  in several specific cases.  These will include determining the influence  of violations of perfect inverted repeat symmetry on cruciform extrusion,  the effects of base methylation on strand separation, and the energetics  of strand separation in molecules containing abasic sites or chemical  adducts.  Transition and destabilization profiles will be calculated for  a variety of DNAs to determine how local susceptibilities to specific  transitions correlate with regulatory regions, mutational hotspots,  chromosomal breakpoints and other sites of biological activity.

"EFFICIENT SOFTWARE FOR THE ANALYSIS OF BIOSEQUENCES We propose to design efficient computer algorithms providing novel and/or  improved methods and software for a number of computational problems in  molecular biology.  the emphasis will b eon blending theoretical results  with practical concerns.  All software emerging from the project will be  made available free of charge.  The proposal and the principal  investigator's current research efforts are divided into three projects.    The first project centers on computational problems in the physical mapping  and sequencing of DNA.  We propose to continue refining a software system  for the fragment assembly problem, i.e., determine the most likely complete  DNA sequence consistent with electrophoresis data gathered from cloned  fragments.  The refinements consist of improved algorithms for a number of  the phases of the computation, expanding the functionality to support user-  interaction, and developing a complete environment to support megabase  sequencing projects.  The methods we developed for fragment assembly also  apply in large part to the problem of determining physical maps via various  fingerprinting techniques.  We have formulated a generalized assembly  problem and plan to build a system that is capable of solving such problems  for any combination of restriction map, digest, and hybridization  information about the clones.    The second project is to design algorithms for a number of computational  problems arising in molecular biology.  Progress in this arena tends to be  inspired rather than calculated.  We demonstrate our track record of  producing interesting results and then describe the following problems for  which we have a number of ideas and preliminary results:  sublinear  similarity searches, restriction map comparison, super pattern matching  (gene recognition), determining restriction maps from digest data,  designing oligonucleotide probes, and RNA secondary structure prediction.    The objective of the last project is to develop a pattern matching system  permitting the expression of complex patterns and their reduction to  efficient search strategies.  The pattern specification language is simple  yet powerful enough to succinctly express the most complex patterns of  biological interest.  An ""expert system"" compiler for the language will  examine a pattern and will choose a search strategy or combination of  strategies from a built-in library of basic search techniques.  The build-  in library will contain implementations of the best available search  algorithms for exact and approximate matches to keywords, repeats, and  regular expressions.  Using a dynamic-programming style calculation the  expert compiler chooses the optimal backtracking strategy over the basic  library searches.  We have proven the efficacy of this approach on a small  prototype for a subset of the language that is useful for specifying  protein motifs.  We now propose to embark upon the construction of a  complete system.

"ADVANCED ALGORITHMS AND TOOLS FOR CONTIG BUILDING This is an application for an NCHGR/SERCA grant (K01) to support  interdisciplinary research in genomic science.  The immediate objective of  this research project is to develop a fully automated/robust algorithm for  computer assembly of high density cosmid contigs to serve as templates for  large-scale sequence-based mapping.  This includes integrating the cosmid  contigs with chromosome-wide YAC based maps and incorporating diverse  sources of data (e.g., DNA sequence from cosmid ends, STSs and other  markers, or results of specific gap-filling efforts) to resolve  ambiguities and verify self-consistency.  Initial efforts will be focused  on the high resolution mapping and sampled sequencing of human chromosome  11.  The mapping strategy employs high density cosmid contig assembly over  individual 200 kb to 1 Mb regions of the chromosome coupled with DNA  sequencing of the cosmid ends.  The relative order and spacing of the  sequence fragments is determined from the template contig resulting in a  physical map of 1 to 5 kb resolution which contains up to 40% of the  entire sequence at one-pass accuracy.  A simple restriction-site based  approach to cosmid fingerprinting will be effective, provided that the  contig-building algorithm correlates fragment data from multiple  restriction digests and includes labeled vector/insert end fragments to  determine the orientation of individual cosmids, i.e., the orientation of  the genomic insert relative to the cloning vector.

"TRANSLATION OF AUTOMATED SEUENCER DATA TO DNA SEQUENCES The primary objective of this research is to improve automated analysis of  gel-based DNA sequencing ladders, through pattern recognition-based  translation of raw instrument data to DNA sequences.

The  performances of pattern recognition and conventional basecalling software  will be evaluated: (1) as experimental errors challenge description of the  natural allelic diversity of human adenoviral genomes; (2) for detection  and specification of heterozygous loci in diploid template experiments;  (3) for primer selection and assembly operations of large scale sequencing  projects. Distributions of basecalling errors will be analyzed in the  contexts of neighboring nucleotide identities and as results of different  sequencing strategies.    Three principal advantages are expected from pattern recognition  basecalling software: (1) analysis of contextual arrays of oligomer traces  improves basecalling accuracy; (2) specifically tasked, neural network and  algorithmic processors support on-line signal conditioning and basecalling  in real time; and (3) the signal conditioning and pattern recognition  modules support objective measures of confidence for each basecall.    This project will significantly and positively impact progress towards the  stated goals of the human genome initiative. No incremental costs for  hardware or strategic modifications are required. Cost savings can be  realized through automation of labor intensive review and editing of  primary data. Real-time basecalling supports higher throughput  instruments, exploiting faster separation of larger parallel arrays of  sequencing ladders. Objective basecall confidence parameters support  overlap assignment during sequence assembly, and should facilitate  sequence - match searches through expanding databases.

"COMPUTER ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF PROTEIN STRUCTURE      The amino acid sequence of a protein uniquely determines its tertiary  structure.  Deciphering this relationship, the protein folding problem, has  become increasingly important to molecular biologists.  DNA sequencing has  become routine, but structural experiments remain very difficult.  Computational strategies are needed to help address this problem.         This proposal describes a strategy to identify the location of  alpha-helices and beta-strands throughout the sequence.  A rationale is  offered for employing neural networks and pattern based algorithms to  address the secondary structure prediction problem.  Once secondary  structure is located, computational methods exist for generating plausible  tertiary structures.  However, these combinatorial strategies give rise to  a large number of alternative structures which are difficult to distinguish  from the correct fold.  Simplified potential functions are proposed as a  method for overcoming this structure evaluation problem.  The properties of  a non-lattice based simplified representation of a polypeptide chain will  be explored to aid in the construction of an appropriate simplified  potential function. Collaborative ventures are planned to experimentally  test the merits of existing algorithms for predicting protein structure.         In collaboration with Dr. Bunn at Harvard, the relationship of the  erythropoietin sequence to its structure and function will be explored.  In  collaboration with Dr.  Wang at UCSF, the merits of a proposed structure of  hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase will be studied using site  directed mutagenesis.

"AC IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY FOR HIV DNA DETECTION DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the applicant's abstract) This project                proposes a biosensor for the detection of DNA fragments specific to HIV.         The sensing element will be an interdigitated array (IDA) having single          stranded DNA immobilized between the array's digits. Immobilized DNA             strands will be complimentary to a conserved sequence in the HIV target          thus allowing selective detection. Electronics capable of measuring              impedance changes will be the detection of the hybridization of                  complementary DNA strands. Impedance spectroscopy, i.e., multiple                frequency impedance measurements, will be used to completely characterize        the sensor's response. The resulting impedance spectrum will be treated          by Neural Network Analysis (NNA) to isolate the hybridized DNA response          from non-specifically adsorbed species and other matrix effects.

"SOLUTION STRUCTURE OF DNA AND DNA-PROTEIN COMPLEXES The three-dimensional structure of DNA is quite dependent on sequence.           This should be intuitively obvious from the sequence specificity required        by many proteins for recognition.  The few available x-ray crystal               structures and NMR solution structures attest to this structural                 flexibility as well.  The location and orientation of potential ligand           binding functions on the DNA such as charges, hydrogen bonding and               hydrophobic sites can be modified substantially from that which one might        expect on the basis of assuming a canonical B-DNA structure.                     Consequently, we intend to continue development of the methodology for           determination of high-resolution nucleic acid structures in solution and         apply this methodology to some oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide              complexes.  This entails methods designed to improve the accuracy and            resolution of the structures determined.  Improved structures can be             obtained with more accurate and more numerous experimental distance and          torsion angle constraints, as well as improvements in calculating                structure from these constraints.  Enhancements will result from                 improvements in our iterative complete relaxation matrix program                 MARDIGRAS, development of a more encompassing density matrix approach for        analysis of spectra derived from any pulse sequences (even those not yet         invented), development of tailored excitation pulses, inclusion of               experimental molecular motion information, and development of alternative        methods of reducing experimental structural constraint data to                   structures.  The latter includes (a) for restrained molecular dynamics           simulations, use of improved force fields, empirical development of              improved force fields, and use of constraint terms permitting a more             realistic picture of conformational flexibility, and (b) development of          an alternative restrained Monte Carlo method in torsion angle and helical        parameter space, which is quite promising especially for structure               refinement directly against NOE intensities.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION FOR ANALYSIS OF MOLECULAR SEQUENCES We propose to work in the development and application of mathematical,           statistical, and computational methods for the analysis of nucleic acid          and amino acid sequence data. The long range goals can be placed into            three categories. (1) Computational analysis is essential to our                 approaches to sequence data. Algorithms are being developed for shotgun          sequence assembly, to search for tandem repeats of length up to 32               basepairs, to find the consensus local alignment of an unknown region            common to an unknown subset of sequences, to study the                           thermodynamic/statistical behavior of experiments that repeatedly select         and amplify DNA molecules, and to weight multiple and suboptimal sequence        alignment paths. (2) Physical mapping of DNA is important in genome              analysis. Studies include the PEP procedure to amplify single chromosomes,       PCR is a branching process including both amplification errors and               efficiency less than 1, the mathematical analysis of physical mapping            using end characterized clones, and classification of multiple solutions         of the double digest problem. (3) As sequence data increase, estimating          statistical significance becomes more central. We will develop methods for       estimating statistical significance of scores of tandem repeats, Poisson         distributional results for sequence alignment in certain cases where the         Chen-Stein method fails, the statistical distribution of correctly               inferred sequence in shotgun sequencing projects as a function of depth          and accuracy, and the growth of minimum free energy of secondary                 structures of a random RNA.

"NEW WORD BASED METHODS FOR DNA SEQUENCE ASSEMBLY The growing use of DNA sequence data in research, databases, diagnostic          and therapeutic biotechnology, and even litigation dramatically                  increases the need to improve the quality of data being used.  This              proposal addresses the problem of assembling a large set of sequenced            DNA fragments into a finished consensus. In order for a sequencing               project to produce high quality finished sequence data, the assembly of          sequence fragments must be correct and accurate both in its large scale          structure and in the fine scale detail of the alignment of individual            base calls. We propose to investigate new algorithms for consensus               estimation and assembly of DNA sequence fragments.  Recent novel word-           based approaches to consensus estimation offer promise as a method for           de novo assembly and for exploring alternative assemblies on the large           scale.  This will be especially important when sequences contain large           exact or approximate repeats.  We propose to develop several main                enhancements to these algorithms.  In particular, we will develop a              global optimization algorithm for determining consensus sequences,               replacing current locally optimizing methods.  Also, we propose to               develop algorithms allowing alternative alignments in regions of                 ambiguity.  This approach will allow us to assess alignment accuracy at          both the large and fine scale level.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION IN MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY Computer algorithms based on pattern recognition are being used in many areas of science and technology to assist the scientist in solving complex, time-consuming, and often tedious real-world problems.  The basic premise is to train a computer to efficiently identify a known pattern in an unknown dataset.  This needle-in-a-haystack approach is being used in the area of genomics, where there are already several examples of very powerful computational pattern recognition approaches available for searching new sequences for structural motifs, similarities to other proteins and DNA, and predicting secondary structure, based solely on the DNA or amino acid sequence.  We believe that macromolecular crystallography can also benefit from the application of pattern recognition to the often daunting task of fitting atoms into an electron density map.  The fact that electron density maps are three-dimensional images provides an additional challenge to this technology in that the procedures we are developing in order to find matching patterns must be rotation invariant.  To test the validity of our hypothesis we will complete the following aims: 1) we will develop a set of rotation invariant features that can characterize the patterns in regions of an electron density map, 2) we will determine the optimal size of feature regions and the size and type of structural database required to find similar regions of electron density capable of accurately determining structures, and 3) we will develop a methodology to synthesize matched regions to produce coherent local and global models of protein structure. If these goals can be met, we will investigate the feasibility of incorporating knowledge-based methods, neural networks, and other AI techniques to augment the interpretation of structures from electron density maps.  In addition, we will attempt to extend this methodology to produce initial structures for electron density maps that are either of poor quality and/or low resolution.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION IN MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY Computer algorithms based on pattern recognition are being used in many areas of science and technology to assist the scientist in solving complex, time-consuming, and often tedious real-world problems.  The basic premise is to train a computer to efficiently identify a known pattern in an unknown dataset.  This needle-in-a-haystack approach is being used in the area of genomics, where there are already several examples of very powerful computational pattern recognition approaches available for searching new sequences for structural motifs, similarities to other proteins and DNA, and predicting secondary structure, based solely on the DNA or amino acid sequence.  We believe that macromolecular crystallography can also benefit from the application of pattern recognition to the often daunting task of fitting atoms into an electron density map.  The fact that electron density maps are three-dimensional images provides an additional challenge to this technology in that the procedures we are developing in order to find matching patterns must be rotation invariant.  To test the validity of our hypothesis we will complete the following aims: 1) we will develop a set of rotation invariant features that can characterize the patterns in regions of an electron density map, 2) we will determine the optimal size of feature regions and the size and type of structural database required to find similar regions of electron density capable of accurately determining structures, and 3) we will develop a methodology to synthesize matched regions to produce coherent local and global models of protein structure. If these goals can be met, we will investigate the feasibility of incorporating knowledge-based methods, neural networks, and other AI techniques to augment the interpretation of structures from electron density maps.  In addition, we will attempt to extend this methodology to produce initial structures for electron density maps that are either of poor quality and/or low resolution.

"Second Generation DNA Sequence Management Tools   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human genome project spurred the            development of high throughput technologies, especially in the area of DNA           sequencing. Not only has this effort produced a draft of the human genome, it's      catalyzed development of an entire industry based on DNA sequencing and              genomics. Since these technologies produce enormous amounts of data they depend      on bioinformatics programs for data management. Phrap, Cross_Match,                  RepeatMasker and Consed are four programs that played an integral role in the        human genome project and became accepted as standard. However, as the                technology for sequencing has evolved, so too, have the applications. These new      applications include sequencing additional genomes, EST cluster analysis, and        genotyping and they have highlighted the need to update standard bioinformatics      programs to meet the current needs of a broader community.

"Pharmacogenetic Prediction of Paroxetine Response  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project proposes the development of a computational model, called GeneRx, to incorporate pharmacogenetics and nonlinear adaptive algorithms toward optimizing anti-schizophrenic therapy on a patient specific basis.   Preliminary studies on the anti-schizophrenic drug olanzapine show a 40% patient-by-patient error between predicted starting dose and optimal therapeutic dose, using a prototype trained only with patient chart information. This is a significant reduction from the range of starting doses for olanzapine currently used, which is from 1 to 80 mgs/day. Anti-schizophrenic drugs likewise have a large window of therapeutic options, including significant variation in dosages, medications, and combinations of therapies used. Using patient-specific genetic information in conjunction with patient medical chart information, obtained from schizophrenia studies performed by outside sources, we propose to develop computational models to predict efficacy of treatment (i.e. Response/Non-response) to the neuroleptic risperidone. Genetic data for each patient will be acquired by genotyping DNA from the blood samples, scored as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present or absent in key schizophrenia-related genes. GeneRx will take a patient's individual genetic, demographic, and environmental variables and predict if the patient will respond initial risperidone drug therapy. Response will be measured by change in standard severity test scores. A more efficient method to prescribe effective anti-schizophrenic pharmaceuticals would expedite recovery, minimize side effects, and reduce medical costs.

"Automated PCR Pathogen Detection and Quantification  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We will develop software for automated pathogen detection and quantification using data from PCR experiments. Automated pathogen detection using data from a PCR experiment requires software to determine whether DNA from the pathogen is present or absent in a sample. We will develop a pattern-matching algorithm to mathematically analyze PCR amplification data. We will optimize the algorithm against a data set of at least 5000 PCR reactions (including a significant set of data gathered during the anthrax attack) to determine its efficacy and limitations. We expect the pathogen detection algorithms to distinguish positives samples from negative samples in more than 98% of the samples, to find inconclusive results in less than 1% of the samples, and to incorrectly classify less than 1% of the samples. We will also develop software to perform automated melting curve analysis of samples that our detection algorithm has determined to be positive or inconclusive. The melting profile of the probes is a property of the assay, and it can be used for secondary confirmation of a pathogen by comparing the profile of the unknown samples to the profile of the assay's positive controls. We will develop algorithms to automatically determine whether the melting profile of the sample and controls match. With melting analysis confirmation, the failure rate of the final detection algorithm should be less than 0.5%.   Automated pathogen quantification requires software to determine the number of copies of a pathogen's DNA in a sample. We will develop discrete dynamical models of PCR for quantification. We will optimize these methods against a large data set of PCR reactions with dilution series. We will systematically determine the features of the models that provide information and the features that can be ignored. We will measure efficacy by comparing computed DNA copy numbers against the known concentrations (as specified by experimenters), and against each other. We will use the most effective model (or models) in the software we produce.

"Statistical Models in Epigenomics The primary objective of this proposal is to develop statistical models for the analysis of DNA methylation data. Questions that are currently posed for gene expression profiles, such as how to classify samples based on cell-wide gene expression patterns or how to classify genes with unknown function, based on their expression patterns across samples, may be similarly posed for DNA methylation patterns.  Our focus is on the discovery of new subgroups based on patterns of DNA methylation.  We view DNA methylation patterns as an intermediate variable along a pathway from exposures to outcomes and take a flexible hierarchical modeling approach that can incorporate measured and unmeasured covariates.  Our aims are motivated by ongoing and planned future studies in the Department of Preventive Medicine and Norris Cancer Center at the University of Southern California.  Specifically, we propose to: 1. Develop model-based class discovery methods (cluster analysis/unsupervised learning approaches) using quantitative measures of DNA methylation, adjusting for locus-specific and sample-specific covariate effects. a.

"Development of Bioinformatic Tools for Virtual Cloning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to delineate (at least in theory) all the proteins encoded in the human genome and all of those encoded by the genomes of major human parasites has given us an unprecedented opportunity to address the causes and treatment of every major human disease.  However, the vast increase in biological knowledge that has resulted from the last decade of genomic DNA sequencing has led us to a a crisis in bioinformatics.  This crisis is two-fold: analysis of data and planning of experiments.  Most of the scientific resources being expended in bioinformatics are being spent on data analysis tools. While these are essential, we should not neglect the opportunity to accelerate the progress of actual experimental biology.  All modern experimental molecular biology (and, increasingly, structural biology) depends upon the availability of plasmid clones to address specific scientific questions.  Although software facilitating DNA manipulations exists, few programs advise users of optimal strategies and none automate the process of clone generation. Genomics initiatives identify proteins at the genome level and demand the generation of hundreds of expression clones for recombinant protein production in exogenous hosts such as E. coli.  Establishment of libraries of expression clones requires automation and optimization as well as effective means of data storage, archiving, annotation and query.  To address these needs, as well as to facilitate routine DNA manipulations in virtually any molecular biology laboratory, we propose (1) to test and build a task centered virtual cloning expert system that serves as a knowledge base for DNA manipulations, and (2) to test and build an information automaton for the construction of expression clone libraries in support of structural genomics initiatives and other high throughput experiments.

"Second Generation DNA Sequence Management Tools   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human genome project spurred the            development of high throughput technologies, especially in the area of DNA           sequencing. Not only has this effort produced a draft of the human genome, it's      catalyzed development of an entire industry based on DNA sequencing and              genomics. Since these technologies produce enormous amounts of data they depend      on bioinformatics programs for data management.

"Novel Methylation Targets in Gastric Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular pathology of gastric carcinoma, the second most common cancer in the world, and of its precancerous precursor lesions has become much better elucidated in recent years, but much remains to be discovered. For example, tumor suppressor gene mutation, DNA hypermethylation, microsatellite instability (MSI), and altered gene expression have been shown to occur frequently during the origin and progression of this cancer. However, a greater understanding of these mechanisms and their timing in gastric carcinogenesis could lead to the ultimate development of early detection and staging biomarkers, as well as novel therapeutic approaches to this deadly disease. Therefore, in order to deepen our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying gastric carcinogenesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) To compare and contrast the global gene expression patterns of various subtypes and premalignant stages of gastric cancer, using cDNA microarrays and bioinformatics algorithms. 1a) cDNA microarrays will be produced and hybridized to amplified RNA from various histologic subtypes and premalignant stage precursor lesions of gastric cancer. 1b) The bioinformatics programs Cluster/Treeview, significance analysis of microarrays (SAM), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines (SVMs) will be used to derive global gene expression patterns for each subtype of gastric cancer or precursor lesion. During this process, we will also identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed among the various subgroups. 2) To perform a limited methylotyping assay to ascertain epigenetic signatures of different types of gastric cancer and premalignant lesions, focusing on known as well as novel CpG islands in the promoter or upstream regions of genes. 2a) Known methylation targets will be analyzed, including E-cadherin (CDH 1), p 16, p 15, p 14-ARF, death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), human mutL homolog 1 (hMLH1), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), RASSFIA, deleted in colon carcinoma (DCC), and 14-3-3-sigma. 2b) Novel methylation target searches will be performed using CpG island microarrays, with alternative backup approaches to include methylation-sensitive genomic DNA digestion followed by arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR), as well as single-gene MSP. 3) To correlate the results of, aims (1) and (2) with each other as well as with other clinical and biologic parameters of these gastric lesions.

"AUTOMATED MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE QUANTIFICATION Quantification of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is a general concern in oncology since this parameter is likely to give valuable information to clinicians to customize chemotherapeutic treatments and to anticipate possible relapses. An automated system will be developed for the quantification of MRD by using real-time PCR to quantify cancer cells in a background of non pathologic DNA. The system will be derived from an existing high-throughput sample handling system (developed by Meldrum and team) named Acapella. Acapella has a pipelined serial architecture which makes it possible to develop an adaptive PCR control algorithm ensuring a level of sensitivity and accuracy for the quantification results specified by the clinician. In the R21 phase of the project, a critical component of the system is the real-time thermocycler. It will provide DNA quantification results of greater precision than what is currently possible with commercial instruments such as the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector by taking advantage of a high performance custom fluorescence analyzer and sophisticated data analysis methods. The fluorescence analyzer will have a signal to noise ratio and a dynamic range of at least one order of magnitude larger than the optics used on commercial systems. This unique feature will permit precise measurements of the amplification kinetics during at least five cycles in the exponential phase of the reaction. The amplification yield will he derived from these data using statistical estimators customized to meet the requirements of real-time PCR data analysis. The sample DNA content will be derived from the amplification yield and the calibrated fluorescence measurements of the reaction kinetics. This new approach will make it possible to run series of real-time PCRs with more flexibility than would be possible if the assay was based on standard reactions required to have the same amplification yield as the clinical samples. PCR conditions will be adapted online without concerns about possible differences of amplification rate. The assay control algorithm will adapt the reaction DNA content, the primer selection, and the number of PCRs to meet the clinician requirements for particular patient DNA. During the R21 phase of the project a prototype of the real-time thermocycler will be developed to demonstrate the optic performance and the possibility to estimate the PCR amplification rates with 5% accuracy. A conceptual design of the fully integrated process from patient blood sample to MRD quantification data will be completed to allow assessment of expected performance, cost, and risks associated with the development of the fully engineered system. The development of the various hardware and software components along with their integration into the automated system will take place during the R33 phase of the project.

This application's specific objective is to build, test and refine an automated system capable of unattended production of 50,000 base pairs of synthetic DNA fragments in less than 18 hours. This system will first be commercialized by incorporating it into Blue Heron Biotechnology's existing automated gene synthesis process. In the future, it could be the basis for a commercial instrument for gene synthesis. The instrument will be based on the novel and innovative technologies for gene assembly developed in the Phase I portion of this research. It will involve both custom-designed instruments and the incorporation of available automation for plate handling and plate storage, novel attachment chemistry and custom-manufactured solid-phase supports.         ",Automated Synthesis of Large DNA Fragments,6702317,R44GM062093,"['biomedical equipment development ', ' biomedical automation ', ' biotechnology ', ' nucleic acid chemical synthesis ', ' artificial intelligence ', ' computer system design /evaluation ', ' computer program /software ', ' genetic manipulation ', ' molecular cloning ', ' oligonucleotide ', ' technology /technique development ', ' ']",NIGMS,"BLUE HERON BIOTECHNOLOGY, INC.",R44,2004,747805,0.09014166158242566
"Second Generation DNA Sequence Management Tools   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human genome project spurred the            development of high throughput technologies, especially in the area of DNA           sequencing. Not only has this effort produced a draft of the human genome, it's      catalyzed development of an entire industry based on DNA sequencing and              genomics. Since these technologies produce enormous amounts of data they depend      on bioinformatics programs for data management. Phrap, Cross_Match,                  RepeatMasker and Consed are four programs that played an integral role in the        human genome project and became accepted as standard. However, as the                technology for sequencing has evolved, so too, have the applications. These new      applications include sequencing additional genomes, EST cluster analysis, and        genotyping and they have highlighted the need to update standard bioinformatics      programs to meet the current needs of a broader community. In this project we        will re-engineer Phrap, Cross_Match and Repeat Masker to improve performance by      optimizing these algorithms and developing a hierarchical data file to store         and manipulate assembled sequence data. Phrap and Cross_Match will also be           modified to use XML-formatted data allowing users to apply constraints to            sequence assembly. Lastly, we will develop a new program to review, edit, and        manipulate sequences, thus giving users unprecedented control over their data.      PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:                                                                                     Phrap is widely used in industry and academia for applications involving DNA sequences.  There are over 100 commercial sites that would benefit from new versions of Phrap that support incremental assemblies and utilize computer resources better.  An API for Phrap will encourage application development creating additional commercialization possibilities for algorithm and application developers.

"Statistical Models in Epigenomics The primary objective of this proposal is to develop statistical models for the analysis of DNA methylation data. Questions that are currently posed for gene expression profiles, such as how to classify samples based on cell-wide gene expression patterns or how to classify genes with unknown function, based on their expression patterns across samples, may be similarly posed for DNA methylation patterns.  Our focus is on the discovery of new subgroups based on patterns of DNA methylation.  We view DNA methylation patterns as an intermediate variable along a pathway from exposures to outcomes and take a flexible hierarchical modeling approach that can incorporate measured and unmeasured covariates.  Our aims are motivated by ongoing and planned future studies in the Department of Preventive Medicine and Norris Cancer Center at the University of Southern California.  Specifically, we propose to: 1. Develop model-based class discovery methods (cluster analysis/unsupervised learning approaches) using quantitative measures of DNA methylation, adjusting for locus-specific and sample-specific covariate effects. a. Analysis of paired samples of tumor tissue and normal tissue taken from the margin of the tumor. b. Extend model to allow for multiple tumors per subject. c.

"Development of Bioinformatic Tools for Virtual Cloning  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The elaboration of the sequences of the human genome and those of many cellular and viral parasites has given us an unprecedented opportunity to address the causes and treatment of every major human disease. It has also resulted in the formation of an entirely new field, bioinformatics, which promises to manage and analyze the vast amount of data being generated.

Most of the scientific and corporate resources being expended in bioinformatics are being spent on data analysis tools. While these are essential, we should not neglect the opportunity to accelerate the progress of actual experimental biology. Essentially every experiment in biology now begins with cloning one or more pieces of DNA.

"Novel Methylation Targets in Gastric Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular pathology of gastric carcinoma, the second most common cancer in the world, and of its precancerous precursor lesions has become much better elucidated in recent years, but much remains to be discovered. For example, tumor suppressor gene mutation, DNA hypermethylation, microsatellite instability (MSI), and altered gene expression have been shown to occur frequently during the origin and progression of this cancer. However, a greater understanding of these mechanisms and their timing in gastric carcinogenesis could lead to the ultimate development of early detection and staging biomarkers, as well as novel therapeutic approaches to this deadly disease. Therefore, in order to deepen our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying gastric carcinogenesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) To compare and contrast the global gene expression patterns of various subtypes and premalignant stages of gastric cancer, using cDNA microarrays and bioinformatics algorithms. 1a) cDNA microarrays will be produced and hybridized to amplified RNA from various histologic subtypes and premalignant stage precursor lesions of gastric cancer. 1b) The bioinformatics programs Cluster/Treeview, significance analysis of microarrays (SAM), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines (SVMs) will be used to derive global gene expression patterns for each subtype of gastric cancer or precursor lesion. During this process, we will also identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed among the various subgroups. 2) To perform a limited methylotyping assay to ascertain epigenetic signatures of different types of gastric cancer and premalignant lesions, focusing on known as well as novel CpG islands in the promoter or upstream regions of genes. 2a) Known methylation targets will be analyzed, including E-cadherin (CDH 1), p 16, p 15, p 14-ARF, death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), human mutL homolog 1 (hMLH1), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), RASSFIA, deleted in colon carcinoma (DCC), and 14-3-3-sigma. 2b) Novel methylation target searches will be performed using CpG island microarrays, with alternative backup approaches to include methylation-sensitive genomic DNA digestion followed by arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR), as well as single-gene MSP. 3) To correlate the results of, aims (1) and (2) with each other as well as with other clinical and biologic parameters of these gastric lesions.

"The MEME suite of motif-based sequence analysis tools DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A wide variety of biological processes and signals are mediated by patterns detectable at the sequence level in proteins, DNA and RNA. For example, one facet of transcriptional regulation of genes involves proteins (transcription factors) recognizing and binding to specific DNA sequence patterns. Other examples of important biological sequence patterns include protein structural domains, microRNAs and the protein target sequences of kinases. The MEME suite of bioinformatics software tools provide biologists with powerful methods for discovering, analyzing and interpreting biological sequence patterns of many types, including those mentioned above. The suite includes one tool - MEME -- that biologists use to discover novel sequence patterns (motifs), and three tools -- Meta-MEME, MCAST and MAST -- that biologists use to search sequence databases for matches to motif-based sequence models. This grant will enable us to dramatically improve the scientific value of the suite to the thousands of biologists who already use it. These improvements will be visible to the biologist using the suite as increased availability, better support, better user-interface and documentation, more powerful algorithms, better interoperability, and faster release cycles.

"Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes a detailed plan for a Cancer Genome Characterization Center (CGCC) to act as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. This CGCC will contribute two platforms to accurately analyze over 1,000 cancer genomes per year using two of the most efficient and informative technologies currently available. In Specific Aim 1 we propose the first platform, a whole genome analysis of copy number changes using Illumina BeadArray(tm) technology. The Illumina 550,000 SNP BeadChip will be used to create high- resolution copy number maps of whole cancer genomes. Our side-by- side comparison of the current 300,000 SNP BeadChip to Digital Karyotyping shows that it provides higher resolution at a dramatically lower cost. Our data show that this technology can be used to accurately detect deletions and amplifications, powerful indicators of genes of interest. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the CpG island hypermethylome in human cancer. Leading experts in the field of cancer epigenetics have a proven approach to define the set of possible genes that have expression silencing as a result of hypermethylation. This assay will again use the Illumina technology for high-throughput and accurate assay of functionally selected 5' CpG islands across the genome, as well as all CpG islands located on chromosomes 21 and 22, and a random selection of non- CpG island CpG sites located on these two chromosomes. In addition to DNA mutations and structural changes, DNA methylation is a significant cause of abnormal gene silencing linked to the development of cancer. In the informatics and data verification proposed in Specific Aim 3 we have developed an integrated approach to organized transmission of raw and verified data to the NCICB Data Coordinating Center using CaBIG-compliant data feeds. We will also make available data analysis tools developed as part of this project. These include means to integrate diverse genomic data from normal and cancer genomes, user- friendly visualization tools, web portals for data sharing, and use machine learning to derive systems biology correlates among available TCGA data, all designed for CaBIG silver or better compliance. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have a rapid and efficient means to assay tens of thousands of cancer genomes, and rapidly produce biologically meaningful data on copy number changes and hypermethylation. This project has direct relevance to public health. Precise knowledge of the type and frequency of the major cancer causing alterations will allow the best molecular targets to be selected for new therapy development.             ",Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins,7233923,U24CA126561,"['genome ', ' neoplasm /cancer ', ' clinical research ', ' CpG island ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U24,2006,781539,0.04567558777300289
"In Silico Analysis of Ocular Genes and Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in computation and high-throughput methods of biomedical data collection have created tremendous opportunities to advance our understanding of visual physiology. We will test the hypothesis that genes and their protein products expressed in ocular tissues can be analyzed in silico using statistical and machine learning techniques and create knowledge regarding ocular gene regulation, structure and function. In particular, these studies will produce testable predictions that may be validated by bench experiments. A primary goal will be to characterize the regulatory elements that govern gene expression in ocular cells. In addition, these tools will be used to characterize ocular protein structure, particularly structure/function relationships and to make predictions about secondary and tertiary structure. Finally, in silico methods will be used to analyze the gene/protein networks that carry out cellular functions such as metabolism, signal transduction and regulation of gone expression. The following specific questions will be addressed in this research:      1) Can computational and statistical methods be used to identify DNA sequences that regulate   ocular gene expression? Can these sequences be used to identify new, uncharacterized   genes in the human genome?      2) Can these methods be used to predict protein structural features in both health and disease   states?      3) Can gene/protein functional networks be elucidated in silico by the use of advanced   analytical and modeling techniques?      This proposal describes a four year training program that aims to develop the independent research abilities of the PI, and to prepare for a career as an individual investigator in computational biology and translational medicine.         ",In Silico Analysis of Ocular Genes and Proteins,7082121,K08EY014665,"['biological signal transduction ', ' eye ', ' trabecular meshwork ', ' vision ', ' gene expression ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' genetic library ', ' genetic regulation ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' metabolism ', ' mathematical model ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' protein structure function ', ' DNA binding protein ', ' glycoprotein ', ' silicon compound ', ' molecular biology information system ', ' functional /structural genomics ', ' serial analysis of gene expression ', ' computational biology ', ' ']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K08,2006,42432,-0.0032521506003100474
"Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic sequencing in nanopores shows great promise for inexpensive DNA sequencing at high speed and with minimal preparative steps. Such capability would lead to efficient reading of human SNPs or other genetic variations, which would in turn have a significant impact in pharmacogenomics and other disease treatments and preventions based on information from the patient's own genome. Recently, researchers identified the inability to regulate the speed of a molecule's translocation through the pore as the primary obstacle to realizing the sequencing potential of hemolysin nanopores.      The proposed research will investigate the application of feedback control to substantially improve the ability to regulate molecule translocation speeds in a nanopore, thereby improving the ability to sequence with existing nanopore technology. In particular, the primary goal is to design novel hardware and software algorithms for feedback control of single polymers in a hemolysin nanopore on a microsecond time scale and with near angstrom precision. Such capability would contribute to the development of nanopore-based sequencing technologies, augment the efforts of the $1000/mammalian genome project, and be a revolutionary contribution to the realm of applied feedback control. The control algorithms would also leverage the long-term objective of the proposed effort: the development of a nanopore-based single cell analyzer. The device would enable one to efficiently determine the concentration of all mRNA in a single cell at an instant of time. This technology would improve the ability to accurately track molecular events that occur during cell differentiation, by reducing the number of cells required for event detection and increasing the time resolution of detection measurements.        There are two primary aspects to the proposed research program that are necessary augmentations to my expertise in control. First, I will engage in a two-year intensive period of didactic training in relevant courses, including molecular and cellular biology, embryology, cell signaling, genomics and bioinformatics.

"A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The structure and dynamics of DNA duplex ends can influence numerous enzyme-dependent processes such as transposition of phage Mu, and integration of HIV dsDNA copies into target chromosomal DNA. Despite their critical importance in biology, DNA duplex ends are significantly under-represented in NMR and crystal structure studies, and their dynamic properties have not been measured directly. The long-term goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive dynamic and structural map of DNA duplex ends. This map will be at near angstrom precision and will include all possible combinations of base pairs for the last six positions of the DNA helix (i.e. 46 = 4096 unique sequences). The approach we will use to generate the map couples NMR spectroscopy with an instrument developed in our laboratory for single molecule measurements. This instrument is based on a nanoscale pore formed by the bacterial toxin, ?-hemolysin. When individual DNA hairpins are captured in this pore by an applied electric field, the duplex stem is suspended in the pore vestibule. Preliminary results suggest that low frequency (kHz) current noise during DNA capture is caused by structural changes of the helix terminus. The aim of this R-21 proposal is to determine if the nanopore detector gives unbiased reads of DNA duplex end structure and dynamics in the Hz to MHz range. Specific questions we will address include: 1) To what extent does the pore vestibule and the applied electric field influence DNA dynamics? 2) Are the duplex end kinetics independent of hairpin loop identity and duplex stem length? 3) There is broad consensus that some sequences are unusually rigid (e.g. A tracts) while others are highly flexible (e.g. TATA). Do these sequences cause nanopore current signatures that cluster together as predicted? 4) Can pattern recognition algorithms be used to automate data analysis? We consider this research to be suited for R-21 funding because there is substantial risk that the outcome will be negative, i.e. we may find that the observed current dynamics are only relevant to the limited case of DNA hairpins captured in a nanoscale protein cavity. However, if the research is successful, it will yield a new way to observe DNA dynamics that reports precise kinetic data, and that is amenable to high throughput experiments. These nanopore experiments will be used to direct subsequent NMR experiments and vice versa.         ",A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends,7024252,R21GM073617,"['bioengineering /biomedical engineering ', ' chemical kinetics ', ' molecular dynamics ', ' nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ', ' artificial intelligence ', ' computer system design /evaluation ', ' computer program /software ', ' electric field ', ' DNA ', ' nucleic acid structure ', ' nucleobase ', ' protein structure ', ' biomedical equipment ', ' technology /technique development ', ' method development ', ' nanotechnology ', ' computational biology ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2006,172838,0.11184821344773635
"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome-wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. Our objective is to develop a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will develop and evaluate modifications and extensions to the ReliefF algorithm for selecting or filtering subsets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction.

Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategy to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a large genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4).

"Vortex Tubed Thermocycler with Intelligent Software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A novel system is proposed for the rapid identification of DNA. The system comprises of a unique thermocycler platform built around the extraordinary vortex tube, detection optics, intelligent software to provide users with information on most ideal operating conditions, and virtual insight into the PCR process as it progresses. An intelligent user interface will allow DNA amplification/detection on an unprecedented timescale (less than 10 minutes). A multi-disciplinary team that consists of a chemical engineer, a mechanical engineer, and two biochemists has been assembled for this project. The efficiency of the vortex tube will be optimized by the use of computational fluid dynamics. Heat transfer between the gas phase and the cuvets will be improved through computational fluid dynamic calculations. The intelligent software consists of a detailed mathematical model that uses similar starting conditions as the initial cuvet composition to model the amplification progress and it performs a virtual PCR in parallel with the actual process. The virtual PCR will become a quantitative tool point-of-care diagnosis of a wide variety of heritable and infectious diseases.

"Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       During the current grant period, we have developed two models of the impact of missense SNPs on protein function in vivo. Through this work, and that of others, we now have a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to monogenic disease. We have also developed a web resource which integrates our results with a large range of other information relevant to disease. Goals for next phase fall into three categories: (1) Exploiting the present results to address basic questions concerning the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Specifically: What is the distribution of mechanisms by which mis-sense SNPs influence protein function; how common are epistatic (non-linear) interactions between SNPs with the same protein molecule and across protein-protein interfaces; what are the characteristics of the approximately 1500 proteins involved in monogenic disease, versus all the others; which SNPs are most significant in directly and indirectly affecting particular biological processes and susceptibility to common diseases? (2) Improving and extending SNP analysis methods, both to obtain a more extensive and reliable set of deleterious mis-sense SNPs, and to include analysis of SNPs that influence disease susceptibility through other processes. New models will be developed for effects on transcription, message processing and translation. Available database information will be augmented by a combination of literature analysis and   soliciting input from appropriate members of the scientific community. (3) Maintain and enhance the web resource to increase its utility to the research community. Functionality will be extended to allow users to input their own SNPs and receive a real time analysis from both models; a user annotation interface will be developed, to capture knowledge on the role of amino acids altered mis-sense SNPs, as well as which genes are most relevant to disease, and what buffering mechanisms shield the phenotype from particular deleterious SNPs; additional information sources will be incorporated, including SNP analysis by others.    Relevance to public health: Many common human diseases, such as heart attack, Alzheimer, asthma and diabetes, are partly inherited, through specific DNA features. At present, there is no common disease for which these inheritance mechanisms are understood. This work will provide specific insight into a number of diseases, and improved understanding of the inheritance process.              ",Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs,7214011,R01LM007174,"['Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Address ', ' Disease Association ', ' Range ', ' in vivo ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Translation Process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' Set protein ', ' Template Activating Factor I Beta ', ' SET Translocation Inhibitor-2 of Protein Phosphatase-2A ', ' Phosphatase 2A Inhibitor I2PP2A ', ' Inhibitor of GZMA-Activated DNase ', ' IGAAD ', ' HLA-DR Associated Protein II ', ' Affect ', ' Genes ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Depth ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Literature ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Methods ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Molting ', ' Ecdysis ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Phenotype ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Work ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Source ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' mutant ', ' protein structure function ', ' Buffers ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Categories ', ' Catalysis ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' falls ', ' Modeling ', ' Communities ', ' Population ', ' human disease ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MD BIOTECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE,R01,2007,312439,0.05944312572233709

Specific questions we will address include: 1) To what extent does the pore vestibule and the applied electric field influence DNA dynamics? 2) Are the duplex end kinetics independent of hairpin loop identity and duplex stem length? 3) There is broad consensus that some sequences are unusually rigid (e.g. A tracts) while others are highly flexible (e.g. TATA). Do these sequences cause nanopore current signatures that cluster together as predicted? 4) Can pattern recognition algorithms be used to automate data analysis? We consider this research to be suited for R-21 funding because there is substantial risk that the outcome will be negative, i.e. we may find that the observed current dynamics are only relevant to the limited case of DNA hairpins captured in a nanoscale protein cavity. However, if the research is successful, it will yield a new way to observe DNA dynamics that reports precise kinetic data, and that is amenable to high throughput experiments. These nanopore experiments will be used to direct subsequent NMR experiments and vice versa.         ",A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends,7229898,R21GM073617,"['Couples ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Digestion ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Caliber ', ' Diameter ', ' DNA mapping ', ' Pore Proteins ', ' Address ', ' Enzymes ', ' Length ', ' Automated Pattern Recognition ', ' Bathing ', ' Baths ', ' Data ', ' Range ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Process ', ' Exonuclease ', ' Future ', ' Output ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' detector ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Helix (Snails) ', ' Hemolysin ', ' Hemalysins ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Algorithms ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Phase ', ' Kinetics ', ' Laboratories ', ' ear helix ', ' Auricle Helix ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Maps ', ' Noise ', ' Bacteriophage mu ', ' Phage mu ', ' Enterobacteria phage Mu ', ' Coliphage mu ', ' polymerization ', ' Shapes ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' electric field ', ' Reading ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Robotics ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vestibule ', ' Vestibular Apparatus ', ' Roentgen Rays ', ' Xrays ', ' X-Rays Radiation ', ' X-Rays ', ' X-Radiation ', ' Radiation, X-Rays, Gamma-Rays ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Bacterial Toxins ', ' Behavior ', ' interest ', ' Biology ', ' professor ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Structure ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Canada ', ' Teflon ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Measures ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5 ', ' Chromosome 5 ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' single molecule ', ' NMR Spectroscopy ', ' nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ', ' nanoscale ', ' nanometer sized ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nano scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nanopore ', ' nano pore ', ' Outcome ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' stem ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2007,143598,0.11184821344773635
"Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes a detailed plan for a Cancer Genome Characterization Center (CGCC) to act as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. This CGCC will contribute two platforms to accurately analyze over 1,000 cancer genomes per year using two of the most efficient and informative technologies currently available. In Specific Aim 1 we propose the first platform, a whole genome analysis of copy number changes using Illumina BeadArray(tm) technology. The Illumina 550,000 SNP BeadChip will be used to create high- resolution copy number maps of whole cancer genomes. Our side-by- side comparison of the current 300,000 SNP BeadChip to Digital Karyotyping shows that it provides higher resolution at a dramatically lower cost. Our data show that this technology can be used to accurately detect deletions and amplifications, powerful indicators of genes of interest. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the CpG island hypermethylome in human cancer. Leading experts in the field of cancer epigenetics have a proven approach to define the set of possible genes that have expression silencing as a result of hypermethylation. This assay will again use the Illumina technology for high-throughput and accurate assay of functionally selected 5' CpG islands across the genome, as well as all CpG islands located on chromosomes 21 and 22, and a random selection of non- CpG island CpG sites located on these two chromosomes. In addition to DNA mutations and structural changes, DNA methylation is a significant cause of abnormal gene silencing linked to the development of cancer. In the informatics and data verification proposed in Specific Aim 3 we have developed an integrated approach to organized transmission of raw and verified data to the NCICB Data Coordinating Center using CaBIG-compliant data feeds. We will also make available data analysis tools developed as part of this project. These include means to integrate diverse genomic data from normal and cancer genomes, user- friendly visualization tools, web portals for data sharing, and use machine learning to derive systems biology correlates among available TCGA data, all designed for CaBIG silver or better compliance. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have a rapid and efficient means to assay tens of thousands of cancer genomes, and rapidly produce biologically meaningful data on copy number changes and hypermethylation. This project has direct relevance to public health. Precise knowledge of the type and frequency of the major cancer causing alterations will allow the best molecular targets to be selected for new therapy development.             ",Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins,7294347,U24CA126561,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Feeds ', ' Data ', ' Hypermethylation ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Resolution ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Karyotype determination procedure ', ' Karyotyping Genetics ', ' Karyotyping ', ' Numbers ', ' Maps ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' CpG Islands ', ' CpG-Rich Islands ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Random Allocation ', ' Random Selection ', ' Silver ', ' Ag element ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Technology ', ' Atlases ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Side ', ' interest ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Gene Silencing ', ' Gene Inactivation ', ' Informatics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21 ', ' Chromosome 21 ', ' high throughput technology ', ' Genomics ', ' cost ', ' cancer genome ', ' digital ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' user-friendly ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U24,2007,873921,0.04567558777300289
"Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposed study will build upon the extensive epidemiologic database and specimen repository derived from an ongoing bladder cancer study entitled ""Genetic Susceptibility to Bladder Cancer: A Molecular Epidemiologic Approach"" (RO1 CA74880, PI: Xifeng Wu). The parent grant involved a multidisciplinary group of researchers applying a molecular epidemiologic approach to identify inter-individual differences in susceptibility to bladder carcinogenesis, with a focus on genes involved in protecting against genomic instability, such as DNA repair, cell cycle, and telomere maintenance. It is increasing recognized that inflammation plays an important role in the etiology of many cancers, including bladder cancer (BC). We have recently shown that an IL-6 promoter SNP (G-174C) is associated with BC risk and progression. In this application, we will test the hypothesis that BC is modulated by common, low penetrance polymorphisms in inflammation related genes, interacting with each other and/or environmental factors. We will take a pathway based genotyping approach and apply novel statistical tools to address the hypothesis. There are 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify candidate polymorphisms in inflammation related genes that predispose individuals to BC. We plan to perform genotyping of a comprehensive list of potential functional polymorphisms in inflammation genes (85 polymorphisms in 44 genes) on 1000 Caucasian cases and 1000 controls matched on age, gender, and ethnicity. Specific Aim 2: To perform genotyping on tagging SNPs for the top 8 candidate genes that were identified in Specific Aim 1 (using a significance level of 0.1) identified in Specific Aim 1. This will give us a complete picture of the role that the specific gene plays in BC etiology. We will implement haplotype-based analyses to identify any additional variants that might have been missed using individual SNP-based approaches. Specific Aim 3: To apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene- gene interactions influencing risk for BC. These analyses will examine SNP main effects and gene-gene interactions, gene-environment interaction and develop and validate algorithms, which will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. The application will allow us to have a comprehensive picture of the effects of functional polymorphisms in inflammation related genes on BC risk.          ",Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk,7320980,R03CA130063,"['Cytogenetics ', ' Telomere Maintenance ', ' Cell Cycle Regulation ', ' Cell Cycle Control ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA Repair ', ' Unscheduled DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA Damage Repair ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Suspension substance ', ' suspension ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red blood corpuscule ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Erythrocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood normocyte ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Medicine ', ' M.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Molecular ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Algorithms ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Interleukin 6 (Interferon, Beta 2) ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 (B cell stimulating factor 2) ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medicine ', ' Mutagens ', ' genotoxic agent ', ' Genotoxins ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Physicians ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Play ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' tool ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Suspensions ', ' Testing ', ' Caucasians ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Penetrance ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Bladder ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' cancer risk ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene interaction ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cells ', ' Gender ', ' Significance Level ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' telomere ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' repository ', ' Genomics ', ' Genomic Instability ', ' Genome Instability ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' parent grant ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R03,2007,77000,0.02748819270043697
"A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The structure and dynamics of DNA duplex ends can influence numerous enzyme-dependent processes such as transposition of phage Mu, and integration of HIV dsDNA copies into target chromosomal DNA. Despite their critical importance in biology, DNA duplex ends are significantly under-represented in NMR and crystal structure studies, and their dynamic properties have not been measured directly. The long-term goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive dynamic and structural map of DNA duplex ends. This map will be at near angstrom precision and will include all possible combinations of base pairs for the last six positions of the DNA helix (i.e. 46 = 4096 unique sequences). The approach we will use to generate the map couples NMR spectroscopy with an instrument developed in our laboratory for single molecule measurements. This instrument is based on a nanoscale pore formed by the bacterial toxin, ?-hemolysin. When individual DNA hairpins are captured in this pore by an applied electric field, the duplex stem is suspended in the pore vestibule. Preliminary results suggest that low frequency (kHz) current noise during DNA capture is caused by structural changes of the helix terminus. The aim of this R-21 proposal is to determine if the nanopore detector gives unbiased reads of DNA duplex end structure and dynamics in the Hz to MHz range. Specific questions we will address include: 1) To what extent does the pore vestibule and the applied electric field influence DNA dynamics? 2) Are the duplex end kinetics independent of hairpin loop identity and duplex stem length? 3) There is broad consensus that some sequences are unusually rigid (e.g. A tracts) while others are highly flexible (e.g. TATA).

"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials. PUBLIC HEALTH REVELANCE: The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for HNPCC, which may also have important implications for sporadic colorectal cancer as well as other cancer sites.             ",Molecular Genetics of HNPCC,7467185,R01CA070759,"['aurora-A kinase ', ' auroraA kinase ', ' Mismatch Repair ', ' Post-Replication Mismatch Repair ', ' Cell

"Visualization and Analysis of the TCGA Data Using the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project aims to determine the feasibility of identifying and cataloging the genomic-level alterations associated with human cancers, including alterations in DNA copy number and transcript levels, epigenetic modifications, cancer somatic mutations, and inherited genetic variance that contribute to cancer susceptibility. As experimental techniques for a comprehensive survey of the cancer landscape mature, there is a great demand in the cancer research field to develop advanced analysis and visualization tools for the characterization and integrative analysis of the large, complex genomic datasets arising from different technology platforms.    The proposed UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser is a suite of web-based tools designed to integrate, visualize and analyze genomic and clinical data generated by the TCGA project. The browser, which will be available at https://cancer.cse.ucsc.edu/, currently consists of three major components: hgHeatmap, hgFeatureSorter and hgPathSorter. The main panel, hgHeatmap, displays a whole-genome-oriented view of genome-wide experimental measurements for individual and sets of samples/patients along with their clinical information. hgFeatureSorter and hgPathSorter together enable investigators to order, filter, aggregate and display data interactively based on any given feature set ranging from clinical features to annotated biological pathways to user-edited collections of genes. Standard and advanced statistical tools will be installed on the server's side through a caBIG-compatible mechanism to provide quantitative analysis of the whole genomic data or any of its subsets. The UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser is an extension of the UCSC Genome Browser; thus it inherits and integrates the Genome Browser's existing rich set of human biology and genetics data to enhance the interpretability of the cancer genomic data. A pathway- centric, multi-layer machine learning algorithm, BioIntegrator, will be built on top of the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for the integration of cancer genomics and clinical data to assess the levels of perturbation of biological pathways in cancers and during the course of therapy, and to predict clinical outcomes.    Collectively, these proposed tools will facilitate a synergistic interaction among clinicians, experimental biologists and bioinformaticians. They will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA cancer genomics data resources, and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools may advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, as well as the development of therapeutic and prevention strategies.           ",Visualization and Analysis of the TCGA Data Using the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browse,7539926,R21CA135937,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Display ', ' Decision Making ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Range ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Transcript ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Compatible ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Intention ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Metadata ', ' Output ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Depth ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' prognostic ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Measurement ', ' Maps ', ' Collaborations ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Patients ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Catalogs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Atlases ', ' Work ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Somatic Mutation ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Secure ', ' Human Biology ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Cataloging ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' cancer genomics ', ' oncogenomics ', ' cancer genome ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' DNA copy number ', ' cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid ', ' caBIG ', ' Plug-in ', ' tumor ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2008,215094,-0.004696177191290058
"VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect millions of people in US and across the world. There is strong evidence of a genetic component in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related traits. An emerging consensus is that both genes and environment and, perhaps more importantly, their interactions are responsible for this complex disease. As a result, many genetic epidemiological (GE) studies of CVD use a study design that tests hundreds of thousands of genetic predictors (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers) and hundreds of (related) disease phenotypes and environmental covariates. This has brought tremendous analytical challenges, particularly the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables. As a result, searching for CVD disease genes has become a task of selecting important variables from a vast number of SNPs and other predictor variables. Our real data analyses in several ongoing large scale CVD related studies motivated us to consider new methodological solutions to the variable selection problem. This application is developed upon these positive preliminary findings. Our main idea is to develop a strategy for selecting important predictors of CVD by integrating multiple sources of information via the method of statistical learning (i.e., optimizing the selection by repeated learning from examples). In this strategy, we will first develop a method for selecting significant SNPs in moderate-dimensional data (e.g., lower thousands of SNPs, in candidate genes studies) by an integrated classifier. The method will build upon existing techniques assessing information of SNPs in haplotype similarity, imputed functional potential, and gene-gene interactions. We then scale up the new method to the high-dimensional setting of genome-wide association studies (e.g., at least hundreds of thousands of SNPs), by dimension reduction that utilizes the local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure in SNPs and by combining latent factor analysis of correlated CVD traits and pathway-based analysis to account for gene-environment (GxE) interactions. A fast-search algorithm will also be developed based on an existing search heuristic that was successfully applied in high-dimensional data of gene expression and genomic sequence analysis. The new methods and algorithms will be coded into R programs and distributed as tool set for an association analysis pipeline. Evaluations of the new methods will be performed by intensive simulation studies and by applying to existing datasets in ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. Results from evaluation studies, together with the ancillary databases generated by the study such as imputed functional scores of potential or known CVD SNPs will be distributed on a dedicated project website. By doing so, we believe that the utilities resulted from the proposed research will make a significant contribution to many ongoing genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related traits.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is aimed at timely development of computational tools for emerging large-scale genome-wide association studies of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) that affect millions of people in US and across the world. The new methods deal with the analytical challenges brought forth by the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables in these studies, and the tools will be applied to ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. The results, together with the computer programs and ancillary databases will make a significant contribution to many ongoing and new genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related diseases.             ",VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,7528626,R01HL091028,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Environment ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' hypertensive heart disease ', ' hypertensive heart disorder ', ' hypertensive cardiomyopathy ', ' heart hypertension ', ' heart disorder hypertension ', ' heart disease hypertension ', ' cardiac hypertension ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Public Domains ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Algorithms ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Hypertrophy ', ' Evaluation ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Numbers ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Nation ', ' Developed Country ', ' Noise ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' ventricular hypertrophy ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Sea ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Solutions ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Statistical Computing ', ' Testing ', ' Investigation ', ' Weight ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Score ', ' Techniques ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' gene interaction ', ' Performance ', ' heuristics ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Exclusion ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Measures ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Accounting ', ' disease phenotype ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' scale up ', ' Computer Programs and Programming ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' ']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,228000,0.03749147150278932
"Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic sequencing in nanopores shows great promise for inexpensive DNA sequencing at high speed and with minimal preparative steps. Such capability would lead to efficient reading of human SNPs or other genetic variations, which would in turn have a significant impact in pharmacogenomics and other disease treatments and preventions based on information from the patient's own genome. Recently, researchers identified the inability to regulate the speed of a molecule's translocation through the pore as the primary obstacle to realizing the sequencing potential of hemolysin nanopores.      The proposed research will investigate the application of feedback control to substantially improve the ability to regulate molecule translocation speeds in a nanopore, thereby improving the ability to sequence with existing nanopore technology. In particular, the primary goal is to design novel hardware and software algorithms for feedback control of single polymers in a hemolysin nanopore on a microsecond time scale and with near angstrom precision. Such capability would contribute to the development of nanopore-based sequencing technologies, augment the efforts of the $1000/mammalian genome project, and be a revolutionary contribution to the realm of applied feedback control. The control algorithms would also leverage the long-term objective of the proposed effort: the development of a nanopore-based single cell analyzer. The device would enable one to efficiently determine the concentration of all mRNA in a single cell at an instant of time. This technology would improve the ability to accurately track molecular events that occur during cell differentiation, by reducing the number of cells required for event detection and increasing the time resolution of detection measurements.        There are two primary aspects to the proposed research program that are necessary augmentations to my expertise in control. First, I will engage in a two-year intensive period of didactic training in relevant courses, including molecular and cellular biology, embryology, cell signaling, genomics and bioinformatics. The basic understanding gained is required for success in the application of control to problems in human health broadly, and in technology development for cell interrogation specifically. Second, I will participate in the $1000/mammalian genome project to learn about the physics and biology of the hemolysin nanopore. In parallel to the $1000 genome project, I will explore the controlled capabilities of the nanopore for efficient mRNA sequencing, using tools from bioinformatics and machine learning to translate the controlled response data into the identity of unknown nucleotides.          ",Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore,7492192,K25HG004035,"['Cytosine ', ' 2(1H)-Pyrimidinone, 4-amino- ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Electronics ', ' Embryology ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular and Cellular Biology ', ' Resolution ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Rate ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feedback ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Affect ', ' Genome ', ' base ', ' cell analyzer ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Hemolysin ', ' Hemalysins ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Measurement ', ' Methods ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Poly C ', "" homopolymer 5'-Cytidylic acid "", ' Polycytidylic Acids ', ' Cytosine Polynucleotides ', ' Poly U ', "" homopolymer 5'-Uridylic acid "", ' Uracil Polynucleotides ', ' Polyuridylic Acids ', ' Poly(rU) ', ' Polymers ', ' tool ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Uracil ', ' 2-hydroxy-4-(3H)-pyrimidione ', ' 2,4-pyrimidinediol ', ' 2,4-dioxopyrimidine ', ' 4-hydroxy-2-(1H)-pyrimidione ', ' 2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Base Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Biology ', ' copolymer ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' success ', ' voltage ', ' V (voltage) ', ' laptop ', ' technology development ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cells ', ' Measures ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' desire ', ' single molecule ', ' Genomics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanopore ', ' nano pore ', ' mammalian genome ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,K25,2008,161298,0.034408796909769335
"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome-wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. Our objective is to develop a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will develop and evaluate modifications and extensions to the ReliefF algorithm for selecting or filtering subsets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction. (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will develop and evaluate a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). The filter approach will be statisyically compared to the wrapper approach. The best ReliefF strategies will be provided as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategy to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a large genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). The methods developed here will be applied to nearly 1500 haplotype tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) across approximately 300 cancer susceptibility genes measured in 542 subjects with bladder cancer and 745 healthy controls ascertained as part of a large epidemiological study from the state of New Hampshire.          ",Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility,7485154,R01LM009012,"['Purpose ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Address ', ' Detection ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Age ', ' analytical method ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Algorithms ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' New Hampshire ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Complex ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene interaction ', ' heuristics ', ' Boxing ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Measures ', ' Modeling ', ' Cancer-Predisposing Gene ', ' Cancer Susceptibility Gene ', ' Communities ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' cancer type ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' combinatorial ', ' open source ', ' human disease ', ' ']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2008,304625,0.016054622926023797
"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.

"Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposed study will build upon the extensive epidemiologic database and specimen repository derived from an ongoing bladder cancer study entitled ""Genetic Susceptibility to Bladder Cancer: A Molecular Epidemiologic Approach"" (RO1 CA74880, PI: Xifeng Wu). The parent grant involved a multidisciplinary group of researchers applying a molecular epidemiologic approach to identify inter-individual differences in susceptibility to bladder carcinogenesis, with a focus on genes involved in protecting against genomic instability, such as DNA repair, cell cycle, and telomere maintenance. It is increasing recognized that inflammation plays an important role in the etiology of many cancers, including bladder cancer (BC). We have recently shown that an IL-6 promoter SNP (G-174C) is associated with BC risk and progression. In this application, we will test the hypothesis that BC is modulated by common, low penetrance polymorphisms in inflammation related genes, interacting with each other and/or environmental factors. We will take a pathway based genotyping approach and apply novel statistical tools to address the hypothesis. There are 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify candidate polymorphisms in inflammation related genes that predispose individuals to BC. We plan to perform genotyping of a comprehensive list of potential functional polymorphisms in inflammation genes (85 polymorphisms in 44 genes) on 1000 Caucasian cases and 1000 controls matched on age, gender, and ethnicity. Specific Aim 2: To perform genotyping on tagging SNPs for the top 8 candidate genes that were identified in Specific Aim 1 (using a significance level of 0.1) identified in Specific Aim 1. This will give us a complete picture of the role that the specific gene plays in BC etiology. We will implement haplotype-based analyses to identify any additional variants that might have been missed using individual SNP-based approaches. Specific Aim 3: To apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene- gene interactions influencing risk for BC. These analyses will examine SNP main effects and gene-gene interactions, gene-environment interaction and develop and validate algorithms, which will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. The application will allow us to have a comprehensive picture of the effects of functional polymorphisms in inflammation related genes on BC risk.          ",Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk,7458073,R03CA130063,"['Pattern ', ' Penetrance ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Suspensions ', ' Testing ', ' Caucasians ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Bladder ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' cancer risk ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene interaction ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cells ', ' Gender ', ' Significance Level ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' telomere ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' repository ', ' Genomics ', ' Genomic Instability ', ' Genome Instability ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' parent grant ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medicine ', ' Mutagens ', ' genotoxic agent ', ' Genotoxins ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Physicians ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Play ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' tool ', ' Cytogenetics ', ' Telomere Maintenance ', ' Cell Cycle Regulation ', ' Cell Cycle Control ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA Repair ', ' Unscheduled DNA Synthesis ', ' DNA Damage Repair ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Suspension substance ', ' suspension ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red blood corpuscule ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Erythrocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood normocyte ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Medicine ', ' M.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Molecular ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Algorithms ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 (B cell stimulating factor 2) ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Interleukin 6 (Interferon, Beta 2) ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R03,2008,77000,0.02748819270043697
"Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes a detailed plan for a Cancer Genome Characterization Center (CGCC) to act as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. This CGCC will contribute two platforms to accurately analyze over 1,000 cancer genomes per year using two of the most efficient and informative technologies currently available. In Specific Aim 1 we propose the first platform, a whole genome analysis of copy number changes using Illumina BeadArray(tm) technology. The Illumina 550,000 SNP BeadChip will be used to create high- resolution copy number maps of whole cancer genomes. Our side-by- side comparison of the current 300,000 SNP BeadChip to Digital Karyotyping shows that it provides higher resolution at a dramatically lower cost. Our data show that this technology can be used to accurately detect deletions and amplifications, powerful indicators of genes of interest. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the CpG island hypermethylome in human cancer. Leading experts in the field of cancer epigenetics have a proven approach to define the set of possible genes that have expression silencing as a result of hypermethylation. This assay will again use the Illumina technology for high-throughput and accurate assay of functionally selected 5' CpG islands across the genome, as well as all CpG islands located on chromosomes 21 and 22, and a random selection of non- CpG island CpG sites located on these two chromosomes. In addition to DNA mutations and structural changes, DNA methylation is a significant cause of abnormal gene silencing linked to the development of cancer. In the informatics and data verification proposed in Specific Aim 3 we have developed an integrated approach to organized transmission of raw and verified data to the NCICB Data Coordinating Center using CaBIG-compliant data feeds. We will also make available data analysis tools developed as part of this project. These include means to integrate diverse genomic data from normal and cancer genomes, user- friendly visualization tools, web portals for data sharing, and use machine learning to derive systems biology correlates among available TCGA data, all designed for CaBIG silver or better compliance. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have a rapid and efficient means to assay tens of thousands of cancer genomes, and rapidly produce biologically meaningful data on copy number changes and hypermethylation. This project has direct relevance to public health. Precise knowledge of the type and frequency of the major cancer causing alterations will allow the best molecular targets to be selected for new therapy development.             ",Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins,7499105,U24CA126561,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Systems Biology ', ' Feeds ', ' Data ', ' Hypermethylation ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Resolution ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Karyotype determination procedure ', ' Karyotyping Genetics ', ' Karyotyping ', ' Numbers ', ' Maps ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' CpG Islands ', ' CpG-Rich Islands ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Random Allocation ', ' Random Selection ', ' Silver ', ' Ag element ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Technology ', ' Atlases ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Side ', ' interest ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Gene Silencing ', ' Gene Inactivation ', ' Informatics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21 ', ' Chromosome 21 ', ' high throughput technology ', ' Genomics ', ' cost ', ' cancer genome ', ' digital ', ' Data Coordinating Center ', ' Data Coordination Center ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' user-friendly ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U24,2008,881014,0.04567558777300289
"Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       During the current grant period, we have developed two models of the impact of missense SNPs on protein function in vivo. Through this work, and that of others, we now have a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to monogenic disease. We have also developed a web resource which integrates our results with a large range of other information relevant to disease. Goals for next phase fall into three categories: (1) Exploiting the present results to address basic questions concerning the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Specifically: What is the distribution of mechanisms by which mis-sense SNPs influence protein function; how common are epistatic (non-linear) interactions between SNPs with the same protein molecule and across protein-protein interfaces; what are the characteristics of the approximately 1500 proteins involved in monogenic disease, versus all the others; which SNPs are most significant in directly and indirectly affecting particular biological processes and susceptibility to common diseases? (2) Improving and extending SNP analysis methods, both to obtain a more extensive and reliable set of deleterious mis-sense SNPs, and to include analysis of SNPs that influence disease susceptibility through other processes. New models will be developed for effects on transcription, message processing and translation. Available database information will be augmented by a combination of literature analysis and   soliciting input from appropriate members of the scientific community. (3) Maintain and enhance the web resource to increase its utility to the research community. Functionality will be extended to allow users to input their own SNPs and receive a real time analysis from both models; a user annotation interface will be developed, to capture knowledge on the role of amino acids altered mis-sense SNPs, as well as which genes are most relevant to disease, and what buffering mechanisms shield the phenotype from particular deleterious SNPs; additional information sources will be incorporated, including SNP analysis by others.    Relevance to public health: Many common human diseases, such as heart attack, Alzheimer, asthma and diabetes, are partly inherited, through specific DNA features. At present, there is no common disease for which these inheritance mechanisms are understood. This work will provide specific insight into a number of diseases, and improved understanding of the inheritance process.              ",Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs,7383901,R01LM007174,"['Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Address ', ' Disease Association ', ' Range ', ' in vivo ', ' Ligand Binding ', ' Translation Process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' Set protein ', ' Template Activating Factor I Beta ', ' SET Translocation Inhibitor-2 of Protein Phosphatase-2A ', ' Phosphatase 2A Inhibitor I2PP2A ', ' Inhibitor of GZMA-Activated DNase ', ' IGAAD ', ' HLA-DR Associated Protein II ', ' Affect ', ' Genes ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Depth ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Literature ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Methods ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Molting ', ' Ecdysis ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Phenotype ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Work ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Source ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' mutant ', ' protein structure function ', ' Buffers ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Categories ', ' Catalysis ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' falls ', ' Modeling ', ' Communities ', ' Population ', ' human disease ', ' ']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MD BIOTECHNOLOGY INSTITUTE,R01,2008,285166,0.05944312572233709
"Statistical and Computational Methods for Systematically Mining the SNP and Gene     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This application is submitted in response to PAR-04-159 ``Small Grants Program for Cancer Epidemiology'' `Analyzing existing data that otherwise may have gone unexplored, such as pooled analysis of data from multiple studies coordinated into consortia.' A quick review of research articles in current literature, there are only tens of paper related to cancer study with integrated SNP and gene expression data. The lack of algorithms and user-friendly software to mine the existing data may be partly blamed. The proposed study will provide useful tools to mine the genetic data from different sources. This pilot project focuses on developing efficient algorithms for clustering, molecular network construction, and biomarker discovery with integrated SNP and gene expression data. With the efficient data mining methods we develop, cancer researchers may get much more useful information from the otherwise unexplored data. Therefore it has broad implications in the analysis of all high priority areas in cancer epidemiology research identified by Progress Review Groups, such as multiple myeloma and cancers of the breast, colon/rectum, prostate, lung, pancreas, and brain, and linking genetic polymorphisms with other variable related to cancer risk. Upon complete the proposed research, the methods/algorithms developed can potentially be applied to other mixed data sources such as methylation, gene expression, and others.

"Enhance human ENCODE by function comparisons to mouse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to discover and use relationships between mouse and human regulatory genomes to advance the ENCODE Project in its effort to map all functional elements in the human genome. Our comparative approach aims to uncover principles and solve problems that are proving difficult by studying the human genome alone. ENCODE is vigorously mapping hundreds of function-associated biochemical markers in selected cell lines, resulting already in tens of millions of reproducible biochemical features. Some observed protein:DNA interactions find and refine known transcriptional enhancers, promoters, silencers, together with associated chromatin structure, as was anticipated. But substantial questions arise as to how many of the myriad biochemical events are functional, what those functions are, which gene or genes are meaningful targets, etc. To highlight and sort functionally important biochemical marks from others, we will systematically identify the molecular events retained by both mouse and human since they diverged. We will then analyze how conservation of biochemical features relates to conservation of DNA sequence and conservation of regulated gene expression. By using the mouse, we can leverage decades of molecular genetics and manipulated mouse genomes that do not exist in any other mammal. In Aim 1 we execute genome-wide assays for biochemical signatures of functional DNA sequences in a few specific mouse cell types. By using well-studied mouse lines and cell states, we can interpret results in light of previously validated elements and in light of ENCODE human results. We will use ENCODE standards for high throughput, sequence-based assays to determine gene expression, DNase hypersensitive sites, histone modifications and selected transcription factor occupancy in seven mouse cell types. The eight selected features are the most informative ones for function, and thus most useful for comparison with human data. In Aim 2, we apply a genome-wide implementation of chromosome conformation capture to map the interactions between transcription factor binding sites and their responsive genes in two cell types. These results will be compared to those from an ENCODE developmental project. Comparative analysis in Aim 3 will insure that the impact of the data we produce will go beyond the individual mouse cell systems per se. To do this we have organized a collaboration of investigators at multiple institutions, in which each group is expert in one or more critical aspects. Our data, made public and accessible via ENCODE, will fuel and accelerate many future studies after the 2-yr stimulus both in and beyond ENCODE. This responds to NHGRI request for applications on ""Enhancement of the value of the human ENCODE Project by conducting a parallel effort on the mouse genome.""

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers. Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation, including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.           Project Narrative The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.

Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.",Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers,7742918,R01CA132065,"['Cytosine ', ' 2(1H)-Pyrimidinone, 4-amino- ', ' histone modification ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA Modification Methylases ', ' Site-Specific DNA-methyltransferase ', ' Modification Methylases ', ' EC 2.1.1.113 ', ' Dnmt ', ' DNA-Methyltransferases ', ' DNA Modification Methyltransferases ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Defect ', ' Aberrant DNA Methylation ', ' DNA Methyltransferase ', ' Data ', ' Deletion Mutation ', ' Ectopic Expression ', ' Hypermethylation ', ' Molecular Target ', ' in vivo ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Tumor-Suppressor Gene Inactivation ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Affect ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Histones ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Site ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Alu Elements ', ' Alu Repetitive Sequences ', ' Alu Family ', ' Lung Neoplasms ', ' Pulmonary Neoplasms ', ' Lung Tumor ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Methylation ', ' Protein Methylation ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' CpG Islands ', ' CpG-Rich Islands ', ' Transgenes ', ' Play ', ' Shapes ', ' Promoter Regions (Genetics) ', ' genetic promoter element ', ' Promotor Regions (Genetics) ', ' Promotor Regions ', ' Promoter Regions ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Publishing ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Repression ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' sound ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' carcinogenesis ', ' Cancer Induction ', ' Tumor Suppressor Proteins ', ' tumor suppressor ', ' Gene Silencing ', ' Gene Inactivation ', ' treatment planning ', ' Primary Neoplasm ', ' Primary Tumor ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC -

"Integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic datasets in multiple cell types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (08) Genomics, and specific Challenge Topic, 08-OD-101, Computational approaches for epigenomic analysis. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence. These epigenetic modifications lead to the diversity of function across different human cell types, and play key roles in the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity during development, and also in health and disease. The human ENCODE project, the NIH Epigenome Roadmap, and several other large-scale experimental efforts are currently underway to map dozens of histone and DNA modifications across multiple human cell types and disease states, generating a diversity of rich epigenomic datasets. This creates a pressing need for the development of rigorous computational methods for the systematic integrative analysis of epigenomic datasets, and for understanding their relationship to other genomic datasets, including gene expression, disease association, and phenotypic profiling. In this proposal, we will develop and apply graphical probabilistic models for describing chromatin modifications, based on multivariate hidden Markov models. We will use these models to discover the set of underlying chromatin state, based on recurrent combinations of epigenetic marks across the entire genome (Aim 1). We will validate and functionally characterize these states based on their enrichments and positional biases with respect to existing functional elements, as well as large-scale gene expression and disease association datasets (Aim 2). Lastly, we will extend these methods to study dynamics of chromatin state across both healthy and disease cell types, and study how these correlate with functional differences between the observed cell types (Aim 3). We will work closely with the scientists involved in data production and facilitate communication and data integration across them, and also with data analysis and coordination centers already established to facilitate sharing of methods and results across the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap consortia, and with the larger community. Overall, the proposed integrative analysis of large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets will provide a unified view of current and planned epigenomic datasets, towards a systematic understanding of gene and genome regulation in health and disease. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence, leading to the diversity of function across different human cell types. This project will create a computational framework and resource to integrate large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets, to understand their functional role in health and disease, and to understand their dynamics across different cell lines and disease states. The knowledge gained can play key roles in understanding the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity during healthy development, and how dysregulation of these processes can lead to the onset of disease.               Narrative: While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence, leading to the diversity of function across different human cell types.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure.

"Gene Prediction by Markov Models and Complementary Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the ab initio self-training algorithms for eukaryotic gene finding developed in the previous grant period in several important directions. First we will upgrade this algorithm to a multilevel data mining approach to allow construction of a consistent ""genome- transcriptome-proteome"" data structure at the early stages of a genome project. Here, we will compensate for an information deficit in various segments of experimental data (such as EST data) by unsupervised machine learning on existing and abundant data segments (an anonymous genomic sequence) with subsequent computational modeling of missing biological information (protein-coding genes and proteins). An important new feature of the self-training algorithm will be the utilization of protein level information to monitor and increase biological relevance of the models derived by the unsupervised iterative algorithm. Second, we will enhance the self-training algorithm developed earlier on a smaller scale and tested on fungal and other ""compact"" eukaryotic genomes (such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) to work with most complex eukaryotic genomes. At this higher level of complexity we see species with host genes occupying just a small fraction of genome which can be inhomogeneous in GC composition, populated with transposable elements and pseudogenes (besides animal genomes, genomes of some fungal pathogens as well as human parasites and their vectors fall into this category). Third, for the human microbiome containing bacterial, archaeal, viral and fungal species, situated at yet another end of the genome in homogeneity spectrum, we will develop improved algorithms and tools for ab initio gene identification. This work will be done in close contact with sequencing and annotation groups from leading genome centers both in the US and abroad.           NARRATIVE Rational systems biology, cancer cure, vaccine development, drug design, is impossible without understanding genomic DNA in human cell.

"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation can cause genetic diseases, and it appears to be a major contributor to susceptibility to common diseases.

"Visualization and Analysis of the TCGA Data Using the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project aims to determine the feasibility of identifying and cataloging the genomic-level alterations associated with human cancers, including alterations in DNA copy number and transcript levels, epigenetic modifications, cancer somatic mutations, and inherited genetic variance that contribute to cancer susceptibility. As experimental techniques for a comprehensive survey of the cancer landscape mature, there is a great demand in the cancer research field to develop advanced analysis and visualization tools for the characterization and integrative analysis of the large, complex genomic datasets arising from different technology platforms.    The proposed UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser is a suite of web-based tools designed to integrate, visualize and analyze genomic and clinical data generated by the TCGA project. The browser, which will be available at https://cancer.cse.ucsc.edu/, currently consists of three major components: hgHeatmap, hgFeatureSorter and hgPathSorter. The main panel, hgHeatmap, displays a whole-genome-oriented view of genome-wide experimental measurements for individual and sets of samples/patients along with their clinical information. hgFeatureSorter and hgPathSorter together enable investigators to order, filter, aggregate and display data interactively based on any given feature set ranging from clinical features to annotated biological pathways to user-edited collections of genes. Standard and advanced statistical tools will be installed on the server's side through a caBIG-compatible mechanism to provide quantitative analysis of the whole genomic data or any of its subsets. The UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser is an extension of the UCSC Genome Browser; thus it inherits and integrates the Genome Browser's existing rich set of human biology and genetics data to enhance the interpretability of the cancer genomic data. A pathway- centric, multi-layer machine learning algorithm, BioIntegrator, will be built on top of the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for the integration of cancer genomics and clinical data to assess the levels of perturbation of biological pathways in cancers and during the course of therapy, and to predict clinical outcomes.    Collectively, these proposed tools will facilitate a synergistic interaction among clinicians, experimental biologists and bioinformaticians. They will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA cancer genomics data resources, and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer.

"VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect millions of people in US and across the world. There is strong evidence of a genetic component in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related traits. An emerging consensus is that both genes and environment and, perhaps more importantly, their interactions are responsible for this complex disease. As a result, many genetic epidemiological (GE) studies of CVD use a study design that tests hundreds of thousands of genetic predictors (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers) and hundreds of (related) disease phenotypes and environmental covariates. This has brought tremendous analytical challenges, particularly the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables. As a result, searching for CVD disease genes has become a task of selecting important variables from a vast number of SNPs and other predictor variables. Our real data analyses in several ongoing large scale CVD related studies motivated us to consider new methodological solutions to the variable selection problem. This application is developed upon these positive preliminary findings. Our main idea is to develop a strategy for selecting important predictors of CVD by integrating multiple sources of information via the method of statistical learning (i.e., optimizing the selection by repeated learning from examples). In this strategy, we will first develop a method for selecting significant SNPs in moderate-dimensional data (e.g., lower thousands of SNPs, in candidate genes studies) by an integrated classifier. The method will build upon existing techniques assessing information of SNPs in haplotype similarity, imputed functional potential, and gene-gene interactions. We then scale up the new method to the high-dimensional setting of genome-wide association studies (e.g., at least hundreds of thousands of SNPs), by dimension reduction that utilizes the local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure in SNPs and by combining latent factor analysis of correlated CVD traits and pathway-based analysis to account for gene-environment (GxE) interactions. A fast-search algorithm will also be developed based on an existing search heuristic that was successfully applied in high-dimensional data of gene expression and genomic sequence analysis. The new methods and algorithms will be coded into R programs and distributed as tool set for an association analysis pipeline. Evaluations of the new methods will be performed by intensive simulation studies and by applying to existing datasets in ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. Results from evaluation studies, together with the ancillary databases generated by the study such as imputed functional scores of potential or known CVD SNPs will be distributed on a dedicated project website. By doing so, we believe that the utilities resulted from the proposed research will make a significant contribution to many ongoing genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related traits.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is aimed at timely development of computational tools for emerging large-scale genome-wide association studies of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) that affect millions of people in US and across the world. The new methods deal with the analytical challenges brought forth by the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables in these studies, and the tools will be applied to ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. The results, together with the computer programs and ancillary databases will make a significant contribution to many ongoing and new genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related diseases.             ",VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,7663792,R01HL091028,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Environment ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' hypertensive heart disease ', ' hypertensive heart disorder ', ' hypertensive cardiomyopathy ', ' heart hypertension ', ' heart disorder hypertension ', ' heart disease hypertension ', ' cardiac hypertension ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Ventricular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Public Domains ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' Algorithms ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Hypertrophy ', ' Evaluation ', ' Learning ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' Individual ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Nation ', ' Developed Country ', ' Noise ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Sea ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Solutions ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Statistical Computing ', ' Testing ', ' Investigation ', ' Weight ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' gene interaction ', ' Performance ', ' heuristics ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Exclusion ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Measures ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Accounting ', ' disease phenotype ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' scale up ', ' public health relevance ', ' Computer Programs and Programming ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' ']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,228000,0.03749147150278932
"Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes a detailed plan for a Cancer Genome Characterization Center (CGCC) to act as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. This CGCC will contribute two platforms to accurately analyze over 1,000 cancer genomes per year using two of the most efficient and informative technologies currently available. In Specific Aim 1 we propose the first platform, a whole genome analysis of copy number changes using Illumina BeadArray(tm) technology. The Illumina 550,000 SNP BeadChip will be used to create high- resolution copy number maps of whole cancer genomes. Our side-by- side comparison of the current 300,000 SNP BeadChip to Digital Karyotyping shows that it provides higher resolution at a dramatically lower cost. Our data show that this technology can be used to accurately detect deletions and amplifications, powerful indicators of genes of interest. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the CpG island hypermethylome in human cancer. Leading experts in the field of cancer epigenetics have a proven approach to define the set of possible genes that have expression silencing as a result of hypermethylation. This assay will again use the Illumina technology for high-throughput and accurate assay of functionally selected 5' CpG islands across the genome, as well as all CpG islands located on chromosomes 21 and 22, and a random selection of non- CpG island CpG sites located on these two chromosomes. In addition to DNA mutations and structural changes, DNA methylation is a significant cause of abnormal gene silencing linked to the development of cancer. In the informatics and data verification proposed in Specific Aim 3 we have developed an integrated approach to organized transmission of raw and verified data to the NCICB Data Coordinating Center using CaBIG-compliant data feeds. We will also make available data analysis tools developed as part of this project. These include means to integrate diverse genomic data from normal and cancer genomes, user- friendly visualization tools, web portals for data sharing, and use machine learning to derive systems biology correlates among available TCGA data, all designed for CaBIG silver or better compliance. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have a rapid and efficient means to assay tens of thousands of cancer genomes, and rapidly produce biologically meaningful data on copy number changes and hypermethylation. This project has direct relevance to public health. Precise knowledge of the type and frequency of the major cancer causing alterations will allow the best molecular targets to be selected for new therapy development.

"Depression susceptibility genes and networks: expression, eQTL and GWAS analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability in the world (WHO). The severe, recurrent form often onsets during childhood or adolescence and becomes chronic. Heritability (35-70%) is similar to that of other common disorders for which genetic methodologies have yielded major discoveries. However, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have not yet produced significant results, and success may require much larger samples than are available. Alternative discovery strategies are urgently needed. Here, we will integrate genome-wide gene expression data from fresh blood with GWAS data to detect expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs - SNP loci that influence gene expression) with the goal of discovering new MDD susceptibility loci using two novel analytic strategies, including a gene network analysis method that will be substantially developed in the context of this work. We will also seek to refine and confirm the results with genome-wide expression data from brain tissue. We will recruit a new, population-based sample of 500 new recurrent MDD cases and 500 depression-free controls, using a novel strategy in collaboration with a survey research company. Using RNA extracted from RNA-stabilized whole blood, genome-wide gene expression levels will be assayed with Illumina HT-12 array, and common SNP genotypes will be assayed (Illumina 660W) from DNA. (We will also assay brain tissue from two regions from 39 case and 27 control specimens for confirmatory studies.) Potential non-genetic sources of variability will be considered and statistically controlled. Two novel analytic strategies will be used to discover MDD susceptibility alleles, genes and gene regulatory networks. (1) A univariate discovery strategy will identify case-control gene expression differences; detect SNP eQTLs for the selected genes using genome-wide SNP data in controls; and test the association of these SNPs to MDD in two independent GWA datasets. The prior selection of a small number of eQTLs in a separate sample greatly improves power by reducing the burden of multiple testing in GWA analysis. (2) We will extend a novel multivariate method that uses machine learning algorithms to detect gene regulatory networks, and then apply this model to the analysis of the association of co-regulated gene modules to MDD. These algorithms (a) use a background pathway graph that integrates a wide range of high-throughput and curated bioinformatic data to predict biological relationships between genes, to bias the algorithm toward biologically plausible hypotheses; and then (b) use eQTL data to construct a set of gene regulatory modules (co-expressed genes) and infer a sparse regulatory program for each module. The method will then be applied to the GWA data, and (using a novel transfer learning method) to brain data. These studies will identify genes and gene networks underlying susceptibility to major depression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells. Using a new set of statistical methods, the study will attempt to identify genes and networks of genes that are altered in some people who suffer from depression. This information would be useful in finding new treatment or prevention strategies.              The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells.

"Machine learning to identify predictive SNPs and complex interaction effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Susceptibility to complex diseases is determined by the coordinated function of multiple genetic variants and environmental factors interacting in a composite and potentially nonlinear manner. Although the genome-wide views provided by advanced single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays present an opportunity to discover previously unrecognized genomic patterns, the ability to recognize such complex features of genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association study to discover genetic determinants of health and disease from massive genomic data. The focus of this application is the development and validation of effective computational statistics approaches to detect complex interaction effects of multi-locus SNPs which could be useful for classification and prediction of disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of complex phenotypes. Based on very promising preliminary studies, the specific aims of this R21 application are carefully designed: (1) to refine and evaluate the recently developed significant conditional association (SCA) criterion and heuristic combinatorial interaction growing (HCIG) search strategy (specifically designed to discover complex interaction effects of multi-locus jointly-predictive SNPs), test and validate on real SNP based realistic simulations and compare with a panel of most relevant existing methods; and (2) to apply SCA- HCIG method to the real SNP data of NIAMS-funded FMS cohort in relationship to metabolic syndrome etc. and develop SNP marker based classification/ prediction models, assessed by the prediction power and initial biological plausibility of the implicated SNP subsets. This proposal represents a unique cross-disciplinary collaboration focusing on the development of new analytical methods to more effectively identify interacting susceptibility SNPs and environmental factors that can be used to determine individual risk to a specific disease and to estimate prognosis and response to treatment.

"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome-wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. Our objective is to develop a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will develop and evaluate modifications and extensions to the ReliefF algorithm for selecting or filtering subsets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction. (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will develop and evaluate a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). The filter approach will be statisyically compared to the wrapper approach. The best ReliefF strategies will be provided as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategy to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in a large genome-wide association study of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). The methods developed here will be applied to nearly 1500 haplotype tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) across approximately 300 cancer susceptibility genes measured in 542 subjects with bladder cancer and 745 healthy controls ascertained as part of a large epidemiological study from the state of New Hampshire.

"Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic sequencing in nanopores shows great promise for inexpensive DNA sequencing at high speed and with minimal preparative steps. Such capability would lead to efficient reading of human SNPs or other genetic variations, which would in turn have a significant impact in pharmacogenomics and other disease treatments and preventions based on information from the patient's own genome. Recently, researchers identified the inability to regulate the speed of a molecule's translocation through the pore as the primary obstacle to realizing the sequencing potential of hemolysin nanopores.      The proposed research will investigate the application of feedback control to substantially improve the ability to regulate molecule translocation speeds in a nanopore, thereby improving the ability to sequence with existing nanopore technology. In particular, the primary goal is to design novel hardware and software algorithms for feedback control of single polymers in a hemolysin nanopore on a microsecond time scale and with near angstrom precision. Such capability would contribute to the development of nanopore-based sequencing technologies, augment the efforts of the $1000/mammalian genome project, and be a revolutionary contribution to the realm of applied feedback control. The control algorithms would also leverage the long-term objective of the proposed effort: the development of a nanopore-based single cell analyzer. The device would enable one to efficiently determine the concentration of all mRNA in a single cell at an instant of time. This technology would improve the ability to accurately track molecular events that occur during cell differentiation, by reducing the number of cells required for event detection and increasing the time resolution of detection measurements.        There are two primary aspects to the proposed research program that are necessary augmentations to my expertise in control. First, I will engage in a two-year intensive period of didactic training in relevant courses, including molecular and cellular biology, embryology, cell signaling, genomics and bioinformatics. The basic understanding gained is required for success in the application of control to problems in human health broadly, and in technology development for cell interrogation specifically. Second, I will participate in the $1000/mammalian genome project to learn about the physics and biology of the hemolysin nanopore. In parallel to the $1000 genome project, I will explore the controlled capabilities of the nanopore for efficient mRNA sequencing, using tools from bioinformatics and machine learning to translate the controlled response data into the identity of unknown nucleotides.          ",Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore,7687632,K25HG004035,"['Detection ', ' Molecular and Cellular Biology ', ' Resolution ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feedback ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Affect ', ' Genome ', ' base ', ' cell analyzer ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Hemolysin ', ' Hemalysins ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Measurement ', ' Methods ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Poly C ', "" homopolymer 5'-Cytidylic acid "", ' Polycytidylic Acids ', ' Cytosine Polynucleotides ', ' Poly U ', "" homopolymer 5'-Uridylic acid "", ' Uracil Polynucleotides ', ' Polyuridylic Acids ', ' Poly(rU) ', ' Polymers ', ' tool ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Uracil ', ' 2-hydroxy-4-(3H)-pyrimidione ', ' 2,4-pyrimidinediol ', ' 2,4-dioxopyrimidine ', ' 4-hydroxy-2-(1H)-pyrimidione ', ' 2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Base Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Biology ', ' copolymer ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' success ', ' voltage ', ' V (voltage) ', ' laptop ', ' technology development ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cells ', ' Measures ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' single molecule ', ' Genomics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanopore ', ' nano pore ', ' mammalian genome ', ' Cytosine ', ' 2(1H)-Pyrimidinone, 4-amino- ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Electronics ', ' Embryology ', ' Data ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,K25,2009,165961,0.034408796909769335
"Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       During the current grant period, we have developed two models of the impact of missense SNPs on protein function in vivo. Through this work, and that of others, we now have a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to monogenic disease. We have also developed a web resource which integrates our results with a large range of other information relevant to disease. Goals for next phase fall into three categories: (1) Exploiting the present results to address basic questions concerning the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Specifically: What is the distribution of mechanisms by which mis-sense SNPs influence protein function; how common are epistatic (non-linear) interactions between SNPs with the same protein molecule and across protein-protein interfaces; what are the characteristics of the approximately 1500 proteins involved in monogenic disease, versus all the others; which SNPs are most significant in directly and indirectly affecting particular biological processes and susceptibility to common diseases? (2) Improving and extending SNP analysis methods, both to obtain a more extensive and reliable set of deleterious mis-sense SNPs, and to include analysis of SNPs that influence disease susceptibility through other processes. New models will be developed for effects on transcription, message processing and translation. Available database information will be augmented by a combination of literature analysis and   soliciting input from appropriate members of the scientific community. (3) Maintain and enhance the web resource to increase its utility to the research community.

"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials. PUBLIC HEALTH REVELANCE: The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for HNPCC, which may also have important implications for sporadic colorectal cancer as well as other cancer sites.             ",Molecular Genetics of HNPCC,7637943,R01CA070759,"['aurora-A kinase ', ' auroraA kinase ', ' Mismatch Repair ', ' Post-Replication Mismatch Repair ', ' Cell Cycle Checkpoint ', ' Base Excision Repairs ', ' DNA Base Excision Repair ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' STK6 gene ', ' STK6 ', ' STK15 Gene ', ' STK15 ', ' BTAK ', ' AURORA2 ', ' ARK1 ', ' CHEK2 gene ', ' RAD53 ', ' PP1425 ', ' CHK2 ', ' CHEK2 ', ' CDS1 ', ' Preventive ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Cancer Model ', ' CancerModel ', ' Cell Cycle Progression ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Nonhomologous DNA End Joining ', ' Non-Homologous End Joining ', ' NHEJ ', ' Ubiquitination ', ' ubiquitin conjugation ', ' ubiquination ', ' Ubiquitinoylation ', ' Ubiquitilation ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Foundations ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Cyclin D1 ', ' cyclin D ', ' c-bcl-1 Proteins ', ' bcl1 Proto-Oncogene Proteins ', ' bcl-1 Proto-Oncogene Proteins ', ' bcl-1 Proto-Oncogene Products ', ' Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-1 ', ' PRAD1 Protein ', ' G1/S-Specific Cyclin D1 ', ' CCND1 Protein ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' early onset ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Germ-Line Mutation ', ' Hereditary Mutation ', ' Germline Mutation ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Learning ', ' Leukocytes ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Individual ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' cdc Genes ', ' Cell Division Cycle Genes ', ' Cell Cycle Genes ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Maintenance ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Play ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Smoking ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Testing ', ' Aspirin ', ' Measurin ', ' Extren ', ' Entericin ', ' Empirin ', ' Ecotrin ', ' Aspergum ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' 2-(Acetyloxy)benzoic Acid ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Nucleotide Excision Repair ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' gene interaction ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Proteolysis ', ' Protein Cleavage ', ' homologous recombination ', ' Budgets ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Abbreviations ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cells ', ' Gender ', ' TP53 gene ', ' p53 Genes ', ' Tumor Protein p53 Gene ', ' TRP53 ', ' TP53 ', ' P53 ', ' MDM2 gene ', ' p53-Binding Protein Gene ', ' MDM2 ', ' MDM 2 ', ' forest ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' cancer site ', ' cancer location ', ' Gene Order ', ' Gene Position ', ' Gene Arrangement ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Microsatellite Instability ', ' Large Intestine Carcinoma ', ' Large Bowel Carcinoma ', ' Colorectal Carcinomas ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Neoplasms ', ' hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer ', ' Lynch Syndrome ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS1, hPMS2) ', ' Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Hereditary Defective Mismatch Repair Syndrome ', ' Hereditary Colorectal Endometrial Cancer Syndrome ', ' Familial Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Familial Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS1, hPMS2) ', ' genetic variant ', ' mutation carrier ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2009,567963,0.03776526381847281
"DNA repair, Cell cycle Checkpoints and Apoptosis and Bladder Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term goal is to become an independent molecular epidemiologist with in-depth training in genetics and advanced statistical methods in order to be able to analyze high throughput gene variant data to explore gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in cancer susceptibility. My career development plan include didatic courses/seminars, meetings with mentors in the areas of human genetics, cancer biology and advanced statistical methods. My research proposal will focus on genetic susceptibility of bladder cancer (BC). I propose to capitalize on availability of epidemiologic and genetic marker data from an on-going case-control study, ""Markers of Genetic Susceptibility to Bladder Cancer""(R01 CA74880,PI:Xifeng. Wu). The parent study currently include over 2,500,mostly Caucasian, BC cases and controls, matched on sex, age and ethnicity. My goal is to identify novel loci that confer bladder cancer susceptibility using state-of-the-art genotyping technology and novel statistical and bioinformatics tools. The Specific Aims are: 1) To enhance my knowledge and skills in genetics and statistics to identify novel genetic loci as susceptibility markers of BC by extending the original45 potential functional SNPs to include additional 2112 tagging SNPs in genes in the DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways in 800 Caucasian cases and 800 Caucasian controls using the Illumina Golden Gate Assay; 2) To assess haplotypes and diplotypes as markers of susceptibility; 3) To use bioinformatics tools to assess functional significance of SNPs in the DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways and to correlate genotype data of DNA repair and cell cycle control with functional data derived from phenotypic assays. The secondary aim is to apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to explore any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions influencing BC risk. My project complements the parent grant in that it: 1) adds tagging SNPs to potential functional SNPs addressed in the parent grant; 2) adds haplotype analyses; 3) proposes novel statistical and bioinformatics approaches. RELEVANCE: Bladder cancer is a tobacco-related cancer which is the fourth most common cancer in men in U.S. The fact that only a fraction of smokers develop bladder cancer indicating genetic susceptibility to the disease. This study will identify novel genetic markers may be useful as biomarkers to identify high-risk populations that could then be targeted for intervention programs.          ","DNA repair, Cell

"VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect millions of people in US and across the world. There is strong evidence of a genetic component in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related traits. An emerging consensus is that both genes and environment and, perhaps more importantly, their interactions are responsible for this complex disease. As a result, many genetic epidemiological (GE) studies of CVD use a study design that tests hundreds of thousands of genetic predictors (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers) and hundreds of (related) disease phenotypes and environmental covariates. This has brought tremendous analytical challenges, particularly the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables. As a result, searching for CVD disease genes has become a task of selecting important variables from a vast number of SNPs and other predictor variables. Our real data analyses in several ongoing large scale CVD related studies motivated us to consider new methodological solutions to the variable selection problem. This application is developed upon these positive preliminary findings. Our main idea is to develop a strategy for selecting important predictors of CVD by integrating multiple sources of information via the method of statistical learning (i.e., optimizing the selection by repeated learning from examples). In this strategy, we will first develop a method for selecting significant SNPs in moderate-dimensional data (e.g., lower thousands of SNPs, in candidate genes studies) by an integrated classifier. The method will build upon existing techniques assessing information of SNPs in haplotype similarity, imputed functional potential, and gene-gene interactions. We then scale up the new method to the high-dimensional setting of genome-wide association studies (e.g., at least hundreds of thousands of SNPs), by dimension reduction that utilizes the local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure in SNPs and by combining latent factor analysis of correlated CVD traits and pathway-based analysis to account for gene-environment (GxE) interactions. A fast-search algorithm will also be developed based on an existing search heuristic that was successfully applied in high-dimensional data of gene expression and genomic sequence analysis. The new methods and algorithms will be coded into R programs and distributed as tool set for an association analysis pipeline. Evaluations of the new methods will be performed by intensive simulation studies and by applying to existing datasets in ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. Results from evaluation studies, together with the ancillary databases generated by the study such as imputed functional scores of potential or known CVD SNPs will be distributed on a dedicated project website. By doing so, we believe that the utilities resulted from the proposed research will make a significant contribution to many ongoing genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related traits.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is aimed at timely development of computational tools for emerging large-scale genome-wide association studies of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) that affect millions of people in US and across the world. The new methods deal with the analytical challenges brought forth by the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables in these studies, and the tools will be applied to ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. The results, together with the computer programs and ancillary databases will make a significant contribution to many ongoing and new genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related diseases.

"Machine learning to identify predictive SNPs and complex interaction effects    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Susceptibility to complex diseases is determined by the coordinated function of multiple genetic variants and environmental factors interacting in a composite and potentially nonlinear manner. Although the genome-wide views provided by advanced single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays present an opportunity to discover previously unrecognized genomic patterns, the ability to recognize such complex features of genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association study to discover genetic determinants of health and disease from massive genomic data. The focus of this application is the development and validation of effective computational statistics approaches to detect complex interaction effects of multi-locus SNPs which could be useful for classification and prediction of disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of complex phenotypes. Based on very promising preliminary studies, the specific aims of this R21 application are carefully designed: (1) to refine and evaluate the recently developed significant conditional association (SCA) criterion and heuristic combinatorial interaction growing (HCIG) search strategy (specifically designed to discover complex interaction effects of multi-locus jointly-predictive SNPs), test and validate on real SNP based realistic simulations and compare with a panel of most relevant existing methods; and (2) to apply SCA- HCIG method to the real SNP data of NIAMS-funded FMS cohort in relationship to metabolic syndrome etc. and develop SNP marker based classification/ prediction models, assessed by the prediction power and initial biological plausibility of the implicated SNP subsets. This proposal represents a unique cross-disciplinary collaboration focusing on the development of new analytical methods to more effectively identify interacting susceptibility SNPs and environmental factors that can be used to determine individual risk to a specific disease and to estimate prognosis and response to treatment. The results could also suggest novel preventive intervetions and therapeutic targets, reduce the burden of diseases, and accelerate the realization of truly personalized medicine.           Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Wang, Yue (Joseph), Ph.D. Machine learning to identify predictive SNPs and complex interaction effects Project Narrative  Susceptibility to complex diseases is determined by the coordinated function of multiple genetic and environmental factors.

"Analysis of the Functional Impact of Coding region SNPs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       During the current grant period, we have developed two models of the impact of missense SNPs on protein function in vivo. Through this work, and that of others, we now have a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to monogenic disease. We have also developed a web resource which integrates our results with a large range of other information relevant to disease. Goals for next phase fall into three categories: (1) Exploiting the present results to address basic questions concerning the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Specifically: What is the distribution of mechanisms by which mis-sense SNPs influence protein function; how common are epistatic (non-linear) interactions between SNPs with the same protein molecule and across protein-protein interfaces; what are the characteristics of the approximately 1500 proteins involved in monogenic disease, versus all the others; which SNPs are most significant in directly and indirectly affecting particular biological processes and susceptibility to common diseases? (2) Improving and extending SNP analysis methods, both to obtain a more extensive and reliable set of deleterious mis-sense SNPs, and to include analysis of SNPs that influence disease susceptibility through other processes. New models will be developed for effects on transcription, message processing and translation. Available database information will be augmented by a combination of literature analysis and   soliciting input from appropriate members of the scientific community. (3) Maintain and enhance the web resource to increase its utility to the research community.

"Predict transcriptional enhancers using epigenetic signatures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activation of eukaryotic gene transcription involves the coordination of a multitude of transcription factors and cofactors on regulatory DNA sequences such as promoters and enhancers and on the chromatin structure containing these elements. Therefore, identification of these regulatory DNA elements is of utmost importance for understanding gene regulation in both healthy and diseased cells. Previous studies have demonstrated many characteristic epigenetic modifications occur at regulatory DNA elements, e.g., high levels of histone acetylation at gene promoters and at many enhancers. In addition, it is known that many regulatory elements carry these epigenetic modifications only in specific cell/tissue types or according to environmental conditions. In recent years, a vast amount of genome-wide histone modification data has been generated using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray chip (ChIP-chip) or with next-generation sequencing technologies (ChIP-Seq). Currently, there is a pressing need for computational methods to analyze genome-wide histone modification data in order to identify functional DNA elements.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel computational method to identify transcriptional regulatory elements on the basis of their epigenetic characteristics. In the field of machine learning, it is well established that meaningful statistical features extracted from raw data can elude more relevant information and increase the prediction accuracy of a classifier. We hypothesize that by introducing efficient data transformation and feature extraction procedures before classification, we can increase the overall prediction accuracy of our method for identifying transcriptional regulatory elements. We propose to test the aforementioned hypothesis by pursuing the following three aims: (1) We will adopt well-established measures from signal processing to design and test a set of statistical features that could give us a better representation of signals in histone modification data. (2) We will evaluate the performance of several commonly used statistical classifiers in predicting enhancers. We will then develop a software tool combining the most informative features from Aim 1 with the optimal classifier. (3) We will apply our computational method to predict novel enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cell and human T cell using genome-wide histone modification maps in these two cell types. We will use both computational and experimental approaches to evaluate the accuracy of our predictions. Although in this project we focus on enhancers, the approach we develop can be readily extended to discover other types of functional DNA elements using histone modification data in different organisms and cell types. )      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers. Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation, including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.           Project Narrative The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.

"Gene Prediction by Markov Models and Complementary Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the ab initio self-training algorithms for eukaryotic gene finding developed in the previous grant period in several important directions. First we will upgrade this algorithm to a multilevel data mining approach to allow construction of a consistent ""genome- transcriptome-proteome"" data structure at the early stages of a genome project. Here, we will compensate for an information deficit in various segments of experimental data (such as EST data) by unsupervised machine learning on existing and abundant data segments (an anonymous genomic sequence) with subsequent computational modeling of missing biological information (protein-coding genes and proteins). An important new feature of the self-training algorithm will be the utilization of protein level information to monitor and increase biological relevance of the models derived by the unsupervised iterative algorithm. Second, we will enhance the self-training algorithm developed earlier on a smaller scale and tested on fungal and other ""compact"" eukaryotic genomes (such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) to work with most complex eukaryotic genomes. At this higher level of complexity we see species with host genes occupying just a small fraction of genome which can be inhomogeneous in GC composition, populated with transposable elements and pseudogenes (besides animal genomes, genomes of some fungal pathogens as well as human parasites and their vectors fall into this category). Third, for the human microbiome containing bacterial, archaeal, viral and fungal species, situated at yet another end of the genome in homogeneity spectrum, we will develop improved algorithms and tools for ab initio gene identification. This work will be done in close contact with sequencing and annotation groups from leading genome centers both in the US and abroad.           NARRATIVE Rational systems biology, cancer cure, vaccine development, drug design, is impossible without understanding genomic DNA in human cell.

"Depression susceptibility genes and networks: expression, eQTL and GWAS analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability in the world (WHO). The severe, recurrent form often onsets during childhood or adolescence and becomes chronic. Heritability (35-70%) is similar to that of other common disorders for which genetic methodologies have yielded major discoveries. However, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have not yet produced significant results, and success may require much larger samples than are available. Alternative discovery strategies are urgently needed. Here, we will integrate genome-wide gene expression data from fresh blood with GWAS data to detect expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs - SNP loci that influence gene expression) with the goal of discovering new MDD susceptibility loci using two novel analytic strategies, including a gene network analysis method that will be substantially developed in the context of this work. We will also seek to refine and confirm the results with genome-wide expression data from brain tissue. We will recruit a new, population-based sample of 500 new recurrent MDD cases and 500 depression-free controls, using a novel strategy in collaboration with a survey research company. Using RNA extracted from RNA-stabilized whole blood, genome-wide gene expression levels will be assayed with Illumina HT-12 array, and common SNP genotypes will be assayed (Illumina 660W) from DNA. (We will also assay brain tissue from two regions from 39 case and 27 control specimens for confirmatory studies.) Potential non-genetic sources of variability will be considered and statistically controlled. Two novel analytic strategies will be used to discover MDD susceptibility alleles, genes and gene regulatory networks. (1) A univariate discovery strategy will identify case-control gene expression differences; detect SNP eQTLs for the selected genes using genome-wide SNP data in controls; and test the association of these SNPs to MDD in two independent GWA datasets. The prior selection of a small number of eQTLs in a separate sample greatly improves power by reducing the burden of multiple testing in GWA analysis. (2) We will extend a novel multivariate method that uses machine learning algorithms to detect gene regulatory networks, and then apply this model to the analysis of the association of co-regulated gene modules to MDD. These algorithms (a) use a background pathway graph that integrates a wide range of high-throughput and curated bioinformatic data to predict biological relationships between genes, to bias the algorithm toward biologically plausible hypotheses; and then (b) use eQTL data to construct a set of gene regulatory modules (co-expressed genes) and infer a sparse regulatory program for each module. The method will then be applied to the GWA data, and (using a novel transfer learning method) to brain data. These studies will identify genes and gene networks underlying susceptibility to major depression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells. Using a new set of statistical methods, the study will attempt to identify genes and networks of genes that are altered in some people who suffer from depression. This information would be useful in finding new treatment or prevention strategies.              The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells.

"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues.

"Multi-point and multi-locus analysis of genomic association data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a new and powerful approach to investigate the effect of inherited genetic variation on risks of complex diseases.

"Functional activity and inter-organismal interactions in the human microbiome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput sequencing has provided a tool capable of observing the human microbiome, but characterizing the biological roles and metabolic potential of these microbial communities remains a significant challenge. Increasing evidence points to the functional activity of gene products, rather than community taxonomic composition, as the most robust descriptor of the microflora's relationship with its host and as a potential point of intervention in modulating human health. Existing computational tools for exploring a newly sequenced metagenome rely heavily on sequence homology and do not yet leverage information from the thousands of publicly available functional experimental results. Likewise, no previous methods have provided genome-scale computational tools for biological hypothesis generation regarding specific molecular interactions among the microflora and with a human host. This proposal aims to develop computational methodology to interpret the functional activity of microfloral communities: 1. Integrate functional information from taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic datasets. We will develop methodology to unify these three representations of microbiome composition by incorporating  information from large scale functional genomic data collections. 2. Identify genomic predictors of inter-species functional activity, including host/microflora interactions and points of community-wide regulatory feedback. We will computationally screen microbiome assays for molecular interactions and regulatory motifs spanning multiple organisms in the community. 3. Implement these technologies as publicly available, accessible, and interpretable tools. We will provide freely available, open source, downloadable and web-based implementations of this methodology for use  by the bioinformatic and biological communities. As high-throughput sequencing becomes more widely used to study microbial communities in the human microbiome and in the environment, computational tools will be necessary to summarize their global functional activity and systems-level regulatory interactions. In the long term, by providing methodology to understand the human microbiome at the molecular level, we hope to enable its future use as a diagnostic indicator and as a point of intervention to improve human health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful. Although we can now gather data on the cellular behavior of these microbes and on their interactions with human beings, computational tools are needed to interpret this information. By developing new software to study these communities of microorganisms, we hope to eventually be able to detect when they may be causing disease and modify their composition to improve human health.              2 Project Narrative DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful.

"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses. There are no existing glioma case-control studies with sufficient numbers of biological samples and common epidemiologic data to conduct a comprehensive validation and replication study, or to address the issues of tumor heterogeneity as we will in this study.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gliomas are a rare and understudied disease that is rapidly fatal.

"DNA repair, Cell cycle Checkpoints and Apoptosis and Bladder Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term goal is to become an independent molecular epidemiologist with in-depth training in genetics and advanced statistical methods in order to be able to analyze high throughput gene variant data to explore gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in cancer susceptibility. My career development plan include didatic courses/seminars, meetings with mentors in the areas of human genetics, cancer biology and advanced statistical methods. My research proposal will focus on genetic susceptibility of bladder cancer (BC). I propose to capitalize on availability of epidemiologic and genetic marker data from an on-going case-control study, ""Markers of Genetic Susceptibility to Bladder Cancer""(R01 CA74880,PI:Xifeng. Wu). The parent study currently include over 2,500,mostly Caucasian, BC cases and controls, matched on sex, age and ethnicity. My goal is to identify novel loci that confer bladder cancer susceptibility using state-of-the-art genotyping technology and novel statistical and bioinformatics tools. The Specific Aims are: 1) To enhance my knowledge and skills in genetics and statistics to identify novel genetic loci as susceptibility markers of BC by extending the original45 potential functional SNPs to include additional 2112 tagging SNPs in genes in the DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways in 800 Caucasian cases and 800 Caucasian controls using the Illumina Golden Gate Assay; 2) To assess haplotypes and diplotypes as markers of susceptibility; 3) To use bioinformatics tools to assess functional significance of SNPs in the DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways and to correlate genotype data of DNA repair and cell cycle control with functional data derived from phenotypic assays. The secondary aim is to apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to explore any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions influencing BC risk. My project complements the parent grant in that it: 1) adds tagging SNPs to potential functional SNPs addressed in the parent grant; 2) adds haplotype analyses; 3) proposes novel statistical and bioinformatics approaches. RELEVANCE: Bladder cancer is a tobacco-related cancer which is the fourth most common cancer in men in U.S. The fact that only a fraction of smokers develop bladder cancer indicating genetic susceptibility to the disease. This study will identify novel genetic markers may be useful as biomarkers to identify high-risk populations that could then be targeted for intervention programs.          ","DNA repair, Cell

"Enhance human ENCODE by function comparisons to mouse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to discover and use relationships between mouse and human regulatory genomes to advance the ENCODE Project in its effort to map all functional elements in the human genome. Our comparative approach aims to uncover principles and solve problems that are proving difficult by studying the human genome alone. ENCODE is vigorously mapping hundreds of function-associated biochemical markers in selected cell lines, resulting already in tens of millions of reproducible biochemical features. Some observed protein:DNA interactions find and refine known transcriptional enhancers, promoters, silencers, together with associated chromatin structure, as was anticipated. But substantial questions arise as to how many of the myriad biochemical events are functional, what those functions are, which gene or genes are meaningful targets, etc. To highlight and sort functionally important biochemical marks from others, we will systematically identify the molecular events retained by both mouse and human since they diverged. We will then analyze how conservation of biochemical features relates to conservation of DNA sequence and conservation of regulated gene expression. By using the mouse, we can leverage decades of molecular genetics and manipulated mouse genomes that do not exist in any other mammal. In Aim 1 we execute genome-wide assays for biochemical signatures of functional DNA sequences in a few specific mouse cell types. By using well-studied mouse lines and cell states, we can interpret results in light of previously validated elements and in light of ENCODE human results. We will use ENCODE standards for high throughput, sequence-based assays to determine gene expression, DNase hypersensitive sites, histone modifications and selected transcription factor occupancy in seven mouse cell types. The eight selected features are the most informative ones for function, and thus most useful for comparison with human data. In Aim 2, we apply a genome-wide implementation of chromosome conformation capture to map the interactions between transcription factor binding sites and their responsive genes in two cell types. These results will be compared to those from an ENCODE developmental project. Comparative analysis in Aim 3 will insure that the impact of the data we produce will go beyond the individual mouse cell systems per se. To do this we have organized a collaboration of investigators at multiple institutions, in which each group is expert in one or more critical aspects. Our data, made public and accessible via ENCODE, will fuel and accelerate many future studies after the 2-yr stimulus both in and beyond ENCODE. This responds to NHGRI request for applications on ""Enhancement of the value of the human ENCODE Project by conducting a parallel effort on the mouse genome.""

"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials. PUBLIC HEALTH REVELANCE: The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for HNPCC, which may also have important implications for sporadic colorectal cancer as well as other cancer sites.             ",Molecular Genetics of HNPCC,7793567,R01CA070759,"['aurora-A kinase ', ' auroraA kinase ', ' Mismatch Repair ', ' Post-Replication Mismatch Repair ', ' Cell Cycle Checkpoint ', ' Base Excision Repairs ', ' DNA Base Excision Repair ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' STK6 gene ', ' STK6 ', ' STK15 Gene ', ' STK15 ', ' BTAK ', ' AURORA2 ', ' ARK1 ', ' CHEK2 gene ', ' RAD53 ', ' PP1425 ', ' CHK2 ', ' CHEK2 ', ' CDS1 ', ' Preventive ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' Mutate ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Cancer Model ', ' CancerModel ', ' Cell Cycle Progression ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Nonhomologous DNA End Joining ', ' Non-Homologous End Joining ', ' NHEJ ', ' Ubiquitination ', ' ubiquitin conjugation ', ' ubiquination ', ' Ubiquitinoylation ', ' Ubiquitilation ', ' Validation ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Foundations ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Cyclin D1 ', ' cyclin D ', ' c-bcl-1 Proteins ', ' bcl1 Proto-Oncogene Proteins ', ' bcl-1 Proto-Oncogene Proteins ', ' bcl-1 Proto-Oncogene Products ', ' Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-1 ', ' PRAD1 Protein ', ' G1/S-Specific Cyclin D1 ', ' CCND1 Protein ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' early onset ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Germ-Line Mutation ', ' Hereditary Mutation ', ' Germline Mutation ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Learning ', ' Leukocytes ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Individual ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' cdc Genes ', ' Cell Division Cycle Genes ', ' Cell Cycle Genes ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Maintenance ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Play ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Smoking ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Testing ', ' Aspirin ', ' Measurin ', ' Extren ', ' Entericin ', ' Empirin ', ' Ecotrin ', ' Aspergum ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' 2-(Acetyloxy)benzoic Acid ', ' Trees ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Nucleotide Excision Repair ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' gene interaction ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Proteolysis ', ' Protein Cleavage ', ' homologous recombination ', ' Budgets ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Abbreviations ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cells ', ' Gender ', ' TP53 gene ', ' p53 Genes ', ' Tumor Protein p53 Gene ', ' TRP53 ', ' TP53 ', ' P53 ', ' MDM2 gene ', ' p53-Binding Protein Gene ', ' MDM2 ', ' MDM 2 ', ' forest ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' cancer site ', ' cancer location ', ' Gene Order ', ' Gene Position ', ' Gene Arrangement ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Microsatellite Instability ', ' Large Intestine Carcinoma ', ' Large Bowel Carcinoma ', ' Colorectal Carcinomas ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Neoplasms ', ' hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer ', ' Lynch Syndrome ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS1, hPMS2) ', ' Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Hereditary Defective Mismatch Repair Syndrome ', ' Hereditary Colorectal Endometrial Cancer Syndrome ', ' Familial Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Familial Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS1, hPMS2) ', ' genetic variant ', ' mutation carrier ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2010,567593,0.03776526381847281
"VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect millions of people in US and across the world. There is strong evidence of a genetic component in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related traits. An emerging consensus is that both genes and environment and, perhaps more importantly, their interactions are responsible for this complex disease. As a result, many genetic epidemiological (GE) studies of CVD use a study design that tests hundreds of thousands of genetic predictors (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers) and hundreds of (related) disease phenotypes and environmental covariates. This has brought tremendous analytical challenges, particularly the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables. As a result, searching for CVD disease genes has become a task of selecting important variables from a vast number of SNPs and other predictor variables. Our real data analyses in several ongoing large scale CVD related studies motivated us to consider new methodological solutions to the variable selection problem. This application is developed upon these positive preliminary findings. Our main idea is to develop a strategy for selecting important predictors of CVD by integrating multiple sources of information via the method of statistical learning (i.e., optimizing the selection by repeated learning from examples). In this strategy, we will first develop a method for selecting significant SNPs in moderate-dimensional data (e.g., lower thousands of SNPs, in candidate genes studies) by an integrated classifier. The method will build upon existing techniques assessing information of SNPs in haplotype similarity, imputed functional potential, and gene-gene interactions. We then scale up the new method to the high-dimensional setting of genome-wide association studies (e.g., at least hundreds of thousands of SNPs), by dimension reduction that utilizes the local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure in SNPs and by combining latent factor analysis of correlated CVD traits and pathway-based analysis to account for gene-environment (GxE) interactions. A fast-search algorithm will also be developed based on an existing search heuristic that was successfully applied in high-dimensional data of gene expression and genomic sequence analysis. The new methods and algorithms will be coded into R programs and distributed as tool set for an association analysis pipeline. Evaluations of the new methods will be performed by intensive simulation studies and by applying to existing datasets in ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. Results from evaluation studies, together with the ancillary databases generated by the study such as imputed functional scores of potential or known CVD SNPs will be distributed on a dedicated project website. By doing so, we believe that the utilities resulted from the proposed research will make a significant contribution to many ongoing genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related traits.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is aimed at timely development of computational tools for emerging large-scale genome-wide association studies of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) that affect millions of people in US and across the world. The new methods deal with the analytical challenges brought forth by the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables in these studies, and the tools will be applied to ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. The results, together with the computer programs and ancillary databases will make a significant contribution to many ongoing and new genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related diseases.             ",VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,7895861,R01HL091028,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Environment ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' hypertensive heart disease ', ' hypertensive heart disorder ', ' hypertensive cardiomyopathy ', ' heart hypertension ', ' heart disorder hypertension ', ' heart disease hypertension ', ' cardiac hypertension ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Ventricular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Public Domains ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' Algorithms ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Hypertrophy ', ' Evaluation ', ' Learning ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' Individual ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Noise ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Sea ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Consensus ', ' Solutions ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Statistical Computing ', ' Testing ', ' Investigation ', ' Weight ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' gene interaction ', ' Performance ', ' heuristics ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Exclusion ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Measures ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Accounting ', ' disease phenotype ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' scale up ', ' public health relevance ', ' Computer Programs and Programming ', ' computer programming ', ' computer program ', ' ']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,228000,0.03749147150278932
"Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic sequencing in nanopores shows great promise for inexpensive DNA sequencing at high speed and with minimal preparative steps. Such capability would lead to efficient reading of human SNPs or other genetic variations, which would in turn have a significant impact in pharmacogenomics and other disease treatments and preventions based on information from the patient's own genome. Recently, researchers identified the inability to regulate the speed of a molecule's translocation through the pore as the primary obstacle to realizing the sequencing potential of hemolysin nanopores.      The proposed research will investigate the application of feedback control to substantially improve the ability to regulate molecule translocation speeds in a nanopore, thereby improving the ability to sequence with existing nanopore technology. In particular, the primary goal is to design novel hardware and software algorithms for feedback control of single polymers in a hemolysin nanopore on a microsecond time scale and with near angstrom precision. Such capability would contribute to the development of nanopore-based sequencing technologies, augment the efforts of the $1000/mammalian genome project, and be a revolutionary contribution to the realm of applied feedback control. The control algorithms would also leverage the long-term objective of the proposed effort: the development of a nanopore-based single cell analyzer. The device would enable one to efficiently determine the concentration of all mRNA in a single cell at an instant of time. This technology would improve the ability to accurately track molecular events that occur during cell differentiation, by reducing the number of cells required for event detection and increasing the time resolution of detection measurements.        There are two primary aspects to the proposed research program that are necessary augmentations to my expertise in control. First, I will engage in a two-year intensive period of didactic training in relevant courses, including molecular and cellular biology, embryology, cell signaling, genomics and bioinformatics. The basic understanding gained is required for success in the application of control to problems in human health broadly, and in technology development for cell interrogation specifically. Second, I will participate in the $1000/mammalian genome project to learn about the physics and biology of the hemolysin nanopore. In parallel to the $1000 genome project, I will explore the controlled capabilities of the nanopore for efficient mRNA sequencing, using tools from bioinformatics and machine learning to translate the controlled response data into the identity of unknown nucleotides.          ",Feedback Control of Biological Polymers in a Nanopore,7910732,K25HG004035,"['Cytosine ', ' 2(1H)-Pyrimidinone, 4-amino- ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Electronics ', ' Embryology ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular and Cellular Biology ', ' Resolution ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feedback ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Affect ', ' Genome ', ' base ', ' cell analyzer ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Hemolysin ', ' Hemalysins ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Algorithms ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Measurement ', ' Methods ', ' Nucleotides ', ' Patients ', ' Physics ', ' Poly C ', "" homopolymer 5'-Cytidylic acid "", ' Polycytidylic Acids ', ' Cytosine Polynucleotides ', ' Poly U ', "" homopolymer 5'-Uridylic acid "", ' Uracil Polynucleotides ', ' Polyuridylic Acids ', ' Poly(rU) ', ' Polymers ', ' tool ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Computer software ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Uracil ', ' 2-hydroxy-4-(3H)-pyrimidione ', ' 2,4-pyrimidinediol ', ' 2,4-dioxopyrimidine ', ' 4-hydroxy-2-(1H)-pyrimidione ', ' 2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Event ', ' Scanning ', ' Base Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' Biology ', ' copolymer ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' success ', ' voltage ', ' V (voltage) ', ' laptop ', ' technology development ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cells ', ' Measures ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' single molecule ', ' Genomics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' nanopore ', ' nano pore ', ' mammalian genome ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,K25,2010,164921,0.034408796909769335
"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). We will continue to make available ReliefF algorithms as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategies to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). We anticipate the proposed machine learning methods will provide powerful new approaches for identifying genetic variations that are predictive of cancer susceptibility.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The technology to measure information about the human genome is advancing at a rapid pace. Despite these advance, the computational methods for analyzing the data have not kept pace. We will develop new computer algorithms and software that can be used to identify genetic biomarkers of common human diseases.

"Integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic datasets in multiple cell types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (08) Genomics, and specific Challenge Topic, 08-OD-101, Computational approaches for epigenomic analysis. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence. These epigenetic modifications lead to the diversity of function across different human cell types, and play key roles in the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity during development, and also in health and disease. The human ENCODE project, the NIH Epigenome Roadmap, and several other large-scale experimental efforts are currently underway to map dozens of histone and DNA modifications across multiple human cell types and disease states, generating a diversity of rich epigenomic datasets. This creates a pressing need for the development of rigorous computational methods for the systematic integrative analysis of epigenomic datasets, and for understanding their relationship to other genomic datasets, including gene expression, disease association, and phenotypic profiling. In this proposal, we will develop and apply graphical probabilistic models for describing chromatin modifications, based on multivariate hidden Markov models. We will use these models to discover the set of underlying chromatin state, based on recurrent combinations of epigenetic marks across the entire genome (Aim 1). We will validate and functionally characterize these states based on their enrichments and positional biases with respect to existing functional elements, as well as large-scale gene expression and disease association datasets (Aim 2). Lastly, we will extend these methods to study dynamics of chromatin state across both healthy and disease cell types, and study how these correlate with functional differences between the observed cell types (Aim 3). We will work closely with the scientists involved in data production and facilitate communication and data integration across them, and also with data analysis and coordination centers already established to facilitate sharing of methods and results across the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap consortia, and with the larger community. Overall, the proposed integrative analysis of large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets will provide a unified view of current and planned epigenomic datasets, towards a systematic understanding of gene and genome regulation in health and disease. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence, leading to the diversity of function across different human cell types. This project will create a computational framework and resource to integrate large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets, to understand their functional role in health and disease, and to understand their dynamics across different cell lines and disease states. The knowledge gained can play key roles in understanding the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity during healthy development, and how dysregulation of these processes can lead to the onset of disease.               Narrative: While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence, leading to the diversity of function across different human cell types.

"Enhance human ENCODE by function comparisons to mouse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to discover and use relationships between mouse and human regulatory genomes to advance the ENCODE Project in its effort to map all functional elements in the human genome. Our comparative approach aims to uncover principles and solve problems that are proving difficult by studying the human genome alone. ENCODE is vigorously mapping hundreds of function-associated biochemical markers in selected cell lines, resulting already in tens of millions of reproducible biochemical features. Some observed protein:DNA interactions find and refine known transcriptional enhancers, promoters, silencers, together with associated chromatin structure, as was anticipated. But substantial questions arise as to how many of the myriad biochemical events are functional, what those functions are, which gene or genes are meaningful targets, etc. To highlight and sort functionally important biochemical marks from others, we will systematically identify the molecular events retained by both mouse and human since they diverged. We will then analyze how conservation of biochemical features relates to conservation of DNA sequence and conservation of regulated gene expression. By using the mouse, we can leverage decades of molecular genetics and manipulated mouse genomes that do not exist in any other mammal. In Aim 1 we execute genome-wide assays for biochemical signatures of functional DNA sequences in a few specific mouse cell types. By using well-studied mouse lines and cell states, we can interpret results in light of previously validated elements and in light of ENCODE human results. We will use ENCODE standards for high throughput, sequence-based assays to determine gene expression, DNase hypersensitive sites, histone modifications and selected transcription factor occupancy in seven mouse cell types. The eight selected features are the most informative ones for function, and thus most useful for comparison with human data. In Aim 2, we apply a genome-wide implementation of chromosome conformation capture to map the interactions between transcription factor binding sites and their responsive genes in two cell types. These results will be compared to those from an ENCODE developmental project. Comparative analysis in Aim 3 will insure that the impact of the data we produce will go beyond the individual mouse cell systems per se. To do this we have organized a collaboration of investigators at multiple institutions, in which each group is expert in one or more critical aspects. Our data, made public and accessible via ENCODE, will fuel and accelerate many future studies after the 2-yr stimulus both in and beyond ENCODE. This responds to NHGRI request for applications on ""Enhancement of the value of the human ENCODE Project by conducting a parallel effort on the mouse genome."" The proposed work will improve the maps of biologically functional DNA sequences in humans, which in turn will help explain how variants in human genome sequences could be associated with human diseases, leading to candidates for novel avenues for effective therapy and prevention.

"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.

"Predict transcriptional enhancers using epigenetic signatures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activation of eukaryotic gene transcription involves the coordination of a multitude of transcription factors and cofactors on regulatory DNA sequences such as promoters and enhancers and on the chromatin structure containing these elements. Therefore, identification of these regulatory DNA elements is of utmost importance for understanding gene regulation in both healthy and diseased cells. Previous studies have demonstrated many characteristic epigenetic modifications occur at regulatory DNA elements, e.g., high levels of histone acetylation at gene promoters and at many enhancers. In addition, it is known that many regulatory elements carry these epigenetic modifications only in specific cell/tissue types or according to environmental conditions. In recent years, a vast amount of genome-wide histone modification data has been generated using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray chip (ChIP-chip) or with next-generation sequencing technologies (ChIP-Seq). Currently, there is a pressing need for computational methods to analyze genome-wide histone modification data in order to identify functional DNA elements.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel computational method to identify transcriptional regulatory elements on the basis of their epigenetic characteristics. In the field of machine learning, it is well established that meaningful statistical features extracted from raw data can elude more relevant information and increase the prediction accuracy of a classifier. We hypothesize that by introducing efficient data transformation and feature extraction procedures before classification, we can increase the overall prediction accuracy of our method for identifying transcriptional regulatory elements. We propose to test the aforementioned hypothesis by pursuing the following three aims: (1) We will adopt well-established measures from signal processing to design and test a set of statistical features that could give us a better representation of signals in histone modification data. (2) We will evaluate the performance of several commonly used statistical classifiers in predicting enhancers. We will then develop a software tool combining the most informative features from Aim 1 with the optimal classifier. (3) We will apply our computational method to predict novel enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cell and human T cell using genome-wide histone modification maps in these two cell types. We will use both computational and experimental approaches to evaluate the accuracy of our predictions. Although in this project we focus on enhancers, the approach we develop can be readily extended to discover other types of functional DNA elements using histone modification data in different organisms and cell types. )      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transcriptional enhancers play an essential role in establishing tissue and developmental stage specific gene expression patterns that are essential for understanding development, cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations as well as the molecular basis of many diseases. The proposed research will lead to the development of a novel computational tool to discover enhancer elements using genome-wide chromatin signatures.

"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials. PUBLIC HEALTH REVELANCE: The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for HNPCC, which may also have important implications for sporadic colorectal cancer as well as other cancer sites.             ",Molecular Genetics of HNPCC,8067773,R01CA070759,"['cancer site ', ' cancer location ', ' forest ', ' aurora-A kinase ', ' auroraA kinase ', ' early onset ', ' Cancer Model ', ' CancerModel ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Smoking ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Abbreviations ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Preventive ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Phase ', ' genetic variant ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' novel ', ' homologous recombination ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Learning ', ' Genes ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Validation ', ' Maintenance ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Mutate ', ' Risk ', ' protein protein interaction ', ' Foundations ', ' Clinical ', ' Cells ', ' Gender ', ' Individual ', ' tool ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' base ', ' Modeling ', ' Area ', ' Techniques ', ' Age ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Genome ', ' Work ', ' Defect ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Complex ', ' Testing ', ' Play ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' MDM2 gene ', ' p53-Binding Protein Gene ', ' MDM2 ', ' MDM 2 ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Data ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Mediating ', ' Goals ', ' CDK4 gene ', ' PSK-J3 ', ' MGC14458 ', ' CMM3 ', ' CDK4 ', ' Cyclin D1 ', ' cyclin D ', ' c-bcl-1 Proteins ', ' bcl1 Proto-Oncogene Proteins ', ' bcl-1 Proto-Oncogene Proteins ', ' bcl-1 Proto-Oncogene Products ', ' Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-1 ', ' PRAD1 Protein ', ' G1/S-Specific Cyclin D1 ', ' CCND1 Protein ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Neoplasms ', ' hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer ', ' Lynch Syndrome ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer ', ' Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS1, hPMS2) ', ' Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Hereditary Defective Mismatch Repair Syndrome ', ' Hereditary Colorectal Endometrial Cancer Syndrome ', ' Familial Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer ', ' Familial Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (hMSH2, hMLH1, hPMS1, hPMS2) ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Gene Order ', ' Gene Position ', ' Gene Arrangement ', ' Aspirin ', ' Measurin ', ' Extren ', ' Entericin ', ' Empirin ', ' Ecotrin ', ' Aspergum ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' 2-(Acetyloxy)benzoic Acid ', ' mutation carrier ', ' Nonhomologous DNA End Joining ', ' Non-Homologous End Joining ', ' NHEJ ', ' Mismatch Repair ', ' Post-Replication Mismatch Repair ', ' STK6 gene ', ' STK6 ', ' STK15 Gene ', ' STK15 ', ' BTAK ', ' AURORA2 ', ' ARK1 ', ' Nucleotide Excision Repair ', ' cdc Genes ', ' Cell Division Cycle Genes ', ' Cell Cycle Genes ', ' Leukocytes ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Cell Cycle Checkpoint ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Budgets ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Ubiquitination ', ' ubiquitin conjugation ', ' ubiquination ', ' Ubiquitinoylation ', ' Ubiquitilation ', ' Base Excision Repairs ', ' DNA Base Excision Repair ', ' Cell Cycle Progression ', ' Trees ', ' Microsatellite Instability ', ' Germ-Line Mutation ', ' Hereditary Mutation ', ' Germline Mutation ', ' CHEK2 gene ', ' RAD53 ', ' PP1425 ', ' CHK2 ', ' CHEK2 ', ' CDS1 ', ' Proteolysis ', ' Protein Cleavage ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Large Intestine Carcinoma ', ' Large Bowel Carcinoma ', ' Colorectal Carcinomas ', ' Age of Onset ', ' gene interaction ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2011,530841,0.03776526381847281
"Integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic datasets in multiple cell types    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (08) Genomics, and specific Challenge Topic, 08-OD-101, Computational approaches for epigenomic analysis. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence. These epigenetic modifications lead to the diversity of function across different human cell types, and play key roles in the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity during development, and also in health and disease. The human ENCODE project, the NIH Epigenome Roadmap, and several other large-scale experimental efforts are currently underway to map dozens of histone and DNA modifications across multiple human cell types and disease states, generating a diversity of rich epigenomic datasets. This creates a pressing need for the development of rigorous computational methods for the systematic integrative analysis of epigenomic datasets, and for understanding their relationship to other genomic datasets, including gene expression, disease association, and phenotypic profiling. In this proposal, we will develop and apply graphical probabilistic models for describing chromatin modifications, based on multivariate hidden Markov models. We will use these models to discover the set of underlying chromatin state, based on recurrent combinations of epigenetic marks across the entire genome (Aim 1). We will validate and functionally characterize these states based on their enrichments and positional biases with respect to existing functional elements, as well as large-scale gene expression and disease association datasets (Aim 2). Lastly, we will extend these methods to study dynamics of chromatin state across both healthy and disease cell types, and study how these correlate with functional differences between the observed cell types (Aim 3). We will work closely with the scientists involved in data production and facilitate communication and data integration across them, and also with data analysis and coordination centers already established to facilitate sharing of methods and results across the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap consortia, and with the larger community. Overall, the proposed integrative analysis of large-scale genomic and epigenomic datasets will provide a unified view of current and planned epigenomic datasets, towards a systematic understanding of gene and genome regulation in health and disease. While the primary DNA sequence of the human genome is ultimately responsible for the encoding and functioning of each cell, a plethora of chromatin and DNA modifications have been described in recent years that can modulate the interpretation of this primary sequence, leading to the diversity of function across different human cell types.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers. Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation, including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.           Project Narrative The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2).

"Statistical Methods for Correlated and High-Dimensional Biomedical Data We propose in the renewal of this MERIT award application to continue developing advanced statistical and computational methods for analysis of correlated and high-dimensional data, which arise frequently in health science research, especially in cancer research. Correlated data are often observed in observational studies and clinical trials, such as longitudinal studies and familial studies.

"Functional activity and inter-organismal interactions in the human microbiome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput sequencing has provided a tool capable of observing the human microbiome, but characterizing the biological roles and metabolic potential of these microbial communities remains a significant challenge. Increasing evidence points to the functional activity of gene products, rather than community taxonomic composition, as the most robust descriptor of the microflora's relationship with its host and as a potential point of intervention in modulating human health. Existing computational tools for exploring a newly sequenced metagenome rely heavily on sequence homology and do not yet leverage information from the thousands of publicly available functional experimental results. Likewise, no previous methods have provided genome-scale computational tools for biological hypothesis generation regarding specific molecular interactions among the microflora and with a human host. This proposal aims to develop computational methodology to interpret the functional activity of microfloral communities: 1. Integrate functional information from taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic datasets. We will develop methodology to unify these three representations of microbiome composition by incorporating  information from large scale functional genomic data collections. 2. Identify genomic predictors of inter-species functional activity, including host/microflora interactions and points of community-wide regulatory feedback. We will computationally screen microbiome assays for molecular interactions and regulatory motifs spanning multiple organisms in the community. 3. Implement these technologies as publicly available, accessible, and interpretable tools. We will provide freely available, open source, downloadable and web-based implementations of this methodology for use  by the bioinformatic and biological communities. As high-throughput sequencing becomes more widely used to study microbial communities in the human microbiome and in the environment, computational tools will be necessary to summarize their global functional activity and systems-level regulatory interactions. In the long term, by providing methodology to understand the human microbiome at the molecular level, we hope to enable its future use as a diagnostic indicator and as a point of intervention to improve human health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful. Although we can now gather data on the cellular behavior of these microbes and on their interactions with human beings, computational tools are needed to interpret this information. By developing new software to study these communities of microorganisms, we hope to eventually be able to detect when they may be causing disease and modify their composition to improve human health.              2 Project Narrative DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful.

"DNA repair, Cell cycle Checkpoints and Apoptosis and Bladder Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term goal is to become an independent molecular epidemiologist with in-depth training in genetics and advanced statistical methods in order to be able to analyze high throughput gene variant data to explore gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in cancer susceptibility. My career development plan include didatic courses/seminars, meetings with mentors in the areas of human genetics, cancer biology and advanced statistical methods. My research proposal will focus on genetic susceptibility of bladder cancer (BC). I propose to capitalize on availability of epidemiologic and genetic marker data from an on-going case-control study, ""Markers of Genetic Susceptibility to Bladder Cancer""(R01 CA74880,PI:Xifeng. Wu). The parent study currently include over 2,500,mostly Caucasian, BC cases and controls, matched on sex, age and ethnicity. My goal is to identify novel loci that confer bladder cancer susceptibility using state-of-the-art genotyping technology and novel statistical and bioinformatics tools. The Specific Aims are: 1) To enhance my knowledge and skills in genetics and statistics to identify novel genetic loci as susceptibility markers of BC by extending the original45 potential functional SNPs to include additional 2112 tagging SNPs in genes in the DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways in 800 Caucasian cases and 800 Caucasian controls using the Illumina Golden Gate Assay; 2) To assess haplotypes and diplotypes as markers of susceptibility; 3) To use bioinformatics tools to assess functional significance of SNPs in the DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways and to correlate genotype data of DNA repair and cell cycle control with functional data derived from phenotypic assays. The secondary aim is to apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to explore any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions influencing BC risk. My project complements the parent grant in that it: 1) adds tagging SNPs to potential functional SNPs addressed in the parent grant; 2) adds haplotype analyses; 3) proposes novel statistical and bioinformatics approaches. RELEVANCE: Bladder cancer is a tobacco-related cancer which is the fourth most common cancer in men in U.S. The fact that only a fraction of smokers develop bladder cancer indicating genetic susceptibility to the disease.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.            There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed.

"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses. There are no existing glioma case-control studies with sufficient numbers of biological samples and common epidemiologic data to conduct a comprehensive validation and replication study, or to address the issues of tumor heterogeneity as we will in this study.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gliomas are a rare and understudied disease that is rapidly fatal. The proposed case-control study of primary malignant glioma (Gliogene Consortium) includes 13-centers, and will address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases.

"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve understanding of risks and causes for many diseases, and may guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will take another approach to identify gene-disease associations: perform ""reverse GWAS,"" or phenome- wide association study (PheWAS), to determine which phenotypes are associated with a given genotype. The project is enabled by a large DNA biobank coupled to a de- identified copy of the electronic medical record. This project has four specific aims. First, the project will develop and validate a standardized approach to extract disease phenotypes from EMR records, integrating national standard terminologies of clinical disorders and descriptors relating to treatment and diagnosis of each disease to create a sharable knowledge base. The project will use natural language processing, structured data queries, and heuristic and machine learning methods to accurately identify patients with each disease and corresponding controls. The second aim is to perform PheWAS analyses using existing genotype data. To validate the method, the project will use PheWAS to ""rediscover"" SNPs with known disease associations. The project will also investigate statistical methods for large-scale multiple hypothesis testing to discover novel phenotype associations. The third aim is to apply the PheWAS algorithms in four other sites with EMR-linked DNA biobanks and compare results. In the fourth aim, the project will validate novel phenotype-genotype associations discovered through PheWAS with new genotyping in a previously untested population. The tools generated from this project will not only make PheWAS possible, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.           The promise of genomic medicine is to predict individuals' disease risk and treatment given their genetic information.

"Gene Prediction by Markov Models and Complementary Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the ab initio self-training algorithms for eukaryotic gene finding developed in the previous grant period in several important directions. First we will upgrade this algorithm to a multilevel data mining approach to allow construction of a consistent ""genome- transcriptome-proteome"" data structure at the early stages of a genome project. Here, we will compensate for an information deficit in various segments of experimental data (such as EST data) by unsupervised machine learning on existing and abundant data segments (an anonymous genomic sequence) with subsequent computational modeling of missing biological information (protein-coding genes and proteins). An important new feature of the self-training algorithm will be the utilization of protein level information to monitor and increase biological relevance of the models derived by the unsupervised iterative algorithm. Second, we will enhance the self-training algorithm developed earlier on a smaller scale and tested on fungal and other ""compact"" eukaryotic genomes (such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) to work with most complex eukaryotic genomes. At this higher level of complexity we see species with host genes occupying just a small fraction of genome which can be inhomogeneous in GC composition, populated with transposable elements and pseudogenes (besides animal genomes, genomes of some fungal pathogens as well as human parasites and their vectors fall into this category). Third, for the human microbiome containing bacterial, archaeal, viral and fungal species, situated at yet another end of the genome in homogeneity spectrum, we will develop improved algorithms and tools for ab initio gene identification. This work will be done in close contact with sequencing and annotation groups from leading genome centers both in the US and abroad.           NARRATIVE Rational systems biology, cancer cure, vaccine development, drug design, is impossible without understanding genomic DNA in human cell.

"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation can cause genetic diseases, and it appears to be a major contributor to susceptibility to common diseases.

"Pattern Discovery for comparative epigenomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a training program that will prepare an effective independent investigator in computational genomics. The candidate has a PhD in biology from the University of Cambridge and will extend his skills in both computational and wet-lab methods through a two-year program of organized mentorship and training, and a structured five-year research program.  This program will promote the command of machine learning as applied to functional genomics data. Dr. William Noble will mentor the candidate's scientific development. Dr. Noble is a recognized leader in computational biology and machine learning. He holds a dual appointment as Associate Professor in Genome Sciences and Com- puter Science and Engineering, and has trained numerous postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. Dr. Jeff Bilmes, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering, will contribute to the mentoring effort, and a committee of experienced genome and computational biologists will advise on science and the candidate's career goals.  Research will focus on the analysis of multiple tracks of data from high-throughput sequencing assays, such as the ChIP-seq data produced by the ENCODE Project. These experiments allow us to obtain a more complete picture of the structure of human chromatin, revealing the behavior of transcription factors, the organization of epigenetic modifications, and the locations of accessible DNA across the entire genome at up to single-base resolution. A current challenge is to discover joint patterns across multiple tracks of these functional genomics results simultaneously. This project will (1) develop computational methods for identifying such patterns, providing new ways of finding both well-understood genomic features and novel functional elements, (2) apply those methods to characterize the similarities and differences among different biological samples, establishing a better understanding of chromatin, the bounds of its variation, and its role in human disease, and (3) validate computational findings with laboratory experiments. The project will use a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), a type of probabilistic graphical model, to represent the statistical dependencies between observed data, such as sequencing tag density, on an inferred hidden state sequence.  The Department of Genome Sciences of the University Of Washington School Of Medicine provides an ideal setting for training a new independent investigator with an extensive program of formal and informal education for postdoctoral scientists, opportunities for collaboration with researchers with expertise in diverse areas, and modern computational and laboratory resources. This environment maximizes the potential for the candidate to obtain the training and perform the research necessary to establish himself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program.         The major outcome of this work will be a trained scientist with the skills to run an independent research pro- gram integrating computational methods and genome biology.

"Genome-Wide Association Analysis of Bladder Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal builds on a rich resource of bladder cancer (BC) cases and controls derived from two ongoing BC studies at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and from two large independent U.S. BC studies - the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a genome-wide scanning approach. There are five specific aims. Aim 1 is to first perform genome-wide, high-density SNP genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP platform on 800 cases and 800 controls from M.D. Anderson, with a target of candidate SNPs of about 28,000; followed by an internal validation to narrow down candidate SNPs to about 1,536 using additional 800 pairs of cases and controls. Illumina's Custom Infinium array will be the genotyping format. In this aim, in addition to individual SNP analysis, we will also implement haplotype-based analyses and pathway aggregation analysis to identify additional genetic loci that might have been overlooked using individual SNP analysis. Aim 2 is the first external validation of the 1,536 SNPs from Aim 1 using 1,000 pairs of cases and controls from the New England BC Study. Illumina's GoldenGate assay will be the genotyping format. After this stage, the candidate SNPs will be narrowed down to about 100. Aim 3 is the second independent external validation using 750 pairs of cases and controls form the New Hampshire BC Study. In this aim, the 100 top candidate SNPs passed from Aims 1 and 2 plus additional functional SNPs in genes containing these SNPs will be genotyped. GoldenGate assay will be used for this aim. Aim 4 is to perform fine mapping studies in the flanking regions of each of the top 25 SNP loci confirmed in Aim 3 to identify causative loci. This will utilize all 6,700 cases and controls. An average of 15 additional SNPs (tagging SNPs and functional SNPs) per gene is expected. Aim 5 is to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene-gene interactions greatly influencing risk for BC in all the 6700 subjects. These analyses will be utilized to examine SNP main effect and develop and validate algorithms that will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. This proposal applies state of art technology to perform a multistage, genome-wide SNP analysis in three largest, well-characterized U.S. population of BC cases and controls, and incorporates complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. In addition, results from this study will be provided to the International Consortium of BC Case Control Studies for future validation. The ability to identify genetically susceptible, high-risk subgroups that would benefit from intensive screening and/or chemopreventive interventions is of immense clinical and public health benefit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Bladder cancer (BC) is a disease mainly caused by smoking and occupational exposure. However, only a small percentage of exposed individuals develop BC. Inherited host genetic factors may play an important role in determining an individual's susceptibility to BC. This proposal builds on three largest well-characterized U.S. populations of BC cases and controls - the M. D. Anderson BC study, the New England BC Study and the New Hampshire BC Study. A total of 6700 cases and controls will be used. The goal is to identify genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC through a non-biased, discovery- driven, genome-wide scanning approach and to incorporate complete epidemiologic data and rich and unique functional data. About 550,000 genetic variations of human genome will be initially screened in an M.D. Anderson population consisting of an equal number of BC cases and normal controls. About 28,000 top candidate variations that are potentially associated with increased BC risk will be first narrowed down and internally replicated in a second M.D. Anderson population, and then be validated in the other two independent U.S. BC populations. Finally, the causative genetic loci that predispose individuals to BC will be mapped. This study is significant because by identifying BC susceptibility loci, it will shed light into the biological mechanisms of BC etiology. Furthermore, it may facilitate identifying high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC, given their genetic makeup and environmental exposures. The ability to identify high-risk subgroups of individuals for BC will provide immense public health benefit for those high- risk people who may be subjected to close surveillance and chemoprevention.

"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.

"A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR FINE-SCALE GENOME WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic regulation of gene expression through variation in DNA methylation plays a critical role in a range of biological processes including cellular differentiation, human disease and cancer. New methods for determining the fine structure of methylation patterns genome-wide have led to an explosion of research in this field. Methylation near the gene promoter is correlated with gene silencing, while unmethylated promoters are potentially active. Current computational methods classify genes as either methylated and silenced or unmethylated and potentially active based on a coarse calculation of CpG methylation state across a window of a few hundred base pairs around the transcription start site. The detailed spatial pattern of methylation across the promoter may be an important determinant of gene expression, but current computational methods ignore this valuable information. Recent work has found regions proximal to CpG island promoters, dubbed ""CpG island shores"", whose methylation state correlates with transcription. CpG island shores are loosely defined, however, and this concept is difficult to apply in practice. While other methylation signatures are also likely to correlate with gene expression, a general framework to identify and study them has not been established. New computational tools for identification and correlation of detailed methylation patterns with gene expression are critical for advancing our understanding of the epigenetics of gene regulation. We propose to develop software tools to detect new methylation signatures at gene promoters that correlate with expression. This will be done within a formal framework so that these signatures can be used to determine differentially methylated genes in a variety of study designs. Taking advantage of the fact  that methylation over short ranges are highly correlated, we will interpolate methylation data at individual  CpG sites in a 10 kb window around the TSS to yield a methylation signature at each promoter that is  independent of primary sequence features. We will then use a metric from topology, the discrete Frechet distance, to calculate the similarity between methylation signatures, and apply this metric to cluster signatures of similar type. We will then determine clusters with methylation signatures that correlate with expression.  Clusters that contain both silenced and expressed genes will be examined to see if other local primary sequence features can be used to discriminate the genes based on expression. This approach will be used to detect methylation changes in case-control studies and in pairwise comparisons, such as needed for timecourse analysis or for the detection of different states of differentiation. The general framework developed here can be expanded in the future to examine methylation signatures at enhancers and gene bodies, as well as to histone marks or other genomic signals that carry detailed spatial information.          Narrative  DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine in CpG dinucleotides, is an important  epigenetic regulator of gene expression in cells. DNA methylation has been implicated in a large number of  biological processes including cellular differentiation and cancer. We will develop software tools to analyze  data from new techniques for mapping DNA methylation genome-wide to discover new methylation signatures  that are associated with silenced and active genes. These will include tools to use these signatures to  determine what genes are differentially regulated in different cell types and in human disease.",A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR FINE-SCALE GENOME WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS,8229567,R21LM011199,"['Algorithms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Cells ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' 2(1H)-Pyrimidinone, 4-amino- ', ' Cytosine ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Explosion ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Histones ', ' In Vitro ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Protein Methylation ', ' Methylation ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Time ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' cytosine-guanine dinucleotide ', "" cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine "", ' cytidine monophosphate guanosine ', ' CG-dinucleotide ', "" 3'-5'-CpG "", ' CpG dinucleotide ', ' Enhancers ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' CpG-Rich Islands ', ' CpG Islands ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' methyl group ', ' Gene Inactivation ', ' Gene Silencing ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Structure ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Metric ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' spatial neglect ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' Genomics ', ' Transcription Start Site ', ' Transcription Initiation Site ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Process ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' human disease ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' ']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2012,152000,0.05121972525320855
"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve understanding of risks and causes for many diseases, and may guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will take another approach to identify gene-disease associations: perform ""reverse GWAS,"" or phenome- wide association study (PheWAS), to determine which phenotypes are associated with a given genotype. The project is enabled by a large DNA biobank coupled to a de- identified copy of the electronic medical record. This project has four specific aims. First, the project will develop and validate a standardized approach to extract disease phenotypes from EMR records, integrating national standard terminologies of clinical disorders and descriptors relating to treatment and diagnosis of each disease to create a sharable knowledge base. The project will use natural language processing, structured data queries, and heuristic and machine learning methods to accurately identify patients with each disease and corresponding controls. The second aim is to perform PheWAS analyses using existing genotype data. To validate the method, the project will use PheWAS to ""rediscover"" SNPs with known disease associations. The project will also investigate statistical methods for large-scale multiple hypothesis testing to discover novel phenotype associations. The third aim is to apply the PheWAS algorithms in four other sites with EMR-linked DNA biobanks and compare results. In the fourth aim, the project will validate novel phenotype-genotype associations discovered through PheWAS with new genotyping in a previously untested population. The tools generated from this project will not only make PheWAS possible, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.           The promise of genomic medicine is to predict individuals' disease risk and treatment given their genetic information. This project will develop methods to identify diseases from electronic medical records and then find novel genetic associations from existing genomic data.",From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations,8326646,R01LM010685,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Algorithms ', ' Appointment ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' Terminology ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' DNA Databanks ', ' DNA Data Banks ', ' DNA Databases ', ' Genetic Research ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Descriptor ', ' Letters ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Investigation ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Scanning ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' experience ', ' heuristics ', ' cohort ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Genomics ', ' Institution ', ' genetic association ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' Disease Association ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Update ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Text ', ' disease phenotype ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Clinical and Translational Science Awards ', ' patient population ', ' treatment response ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' phenome ', ' phenomics ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' Secure ', ' ']",NLM,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,332514,0.028943986135892236
"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data.

"Gene Prediction by Markov Models and Complementary Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the ab initio self-training algorithms for eukaryotic gene finding developed in the previous grant period in several important directions. First we will upgrade this algorithm to a multilevel data mining approach to allow construction of a consistent ""genome- transcriptome-proteome"" data structure at the early stages of a genome project. Here, we will compensate for an information deficit in various segments of experimental data (such as EST data) by unsupervised machine learning on existing and abundant data segments (an anonymous genomic sequence) with subsequent computational modeling of missing biological information (protein-coding genes and proteins). An important new feature of the self-training algorithm will be the utilization of protein level information to monitor and increase biological relevance of the models derived by the unsupervised iterative algorithm. Second, we will enhance the self-training algorithm developed earlier on a smaller scale and tested on fungal and other ""compact"" eukaryotic genomes (such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) to work with most complex eukaryotic genomes. At this higher level of complexity we see species with host genes occupying just a small fraction of genome which can be inhomogeneous in GC composition, populated with transposable elements and pseudogenes (besides animal genomes, genomes of some fungal pathogens as well as human parasites and their vectors fall into this category). Third, for the human microbiome containing bacterial, archaeal, viral and fungal species, situated at yet another end of the genome in homogeneity spectrum, we will develop improved algorithms and tools for ab initio gene identification. This work will be done in close contact with sequencing and annotation groups from leading genome centers both in the US and abroad.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.         There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations.

"Functional activity and inter-organismal interactions in the human microbiome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput sequencing has provided a tool capable of observing the human microbiome, but characterizing the biological roles and metabolic potential of these microbial communities remains a significant challenge. Increasing evidence points to the functional activity of gene products, rather than community taxonomic composition, as the most robust descriptor of the microflora's relationship with its host and as a potential point of intervention in modulating human health. Existing computational tools for exploring a newly sequenced metagenome rely heavily on sequence homology and do not yet leverage information from the thousands of publicly available functional experimental results. Likewise, no previous methods have provided genome-scale computational tools for biological hypothesis generation regarding specific molecular interactions among the microflora and with a human host. This proposal aims to develop computational methodology to interpret the functional activity of microfloral communities: 1. Integrate functional information from taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic datasets. We will develop methodology to unify these three representations of microbiome composition by incorporating  information from large scale functional genomic data collections. 2. Identify genomic predictors of inter-species functional activity, including host/microflora interactions and points of community-wide regulatory feedback. We will computationally screen microbiome assays for molecular interactions and regulatory motifs spanning multiple organisms in the community. 3. Implement these technologies as publicly available, accessible, and interpretable tools. We will provide freely available, open source, downloadable and web-based implementations of this methodology for use  by the bioinformatic and biological communities. As high-throughput sequencing becomes more widely used to study microbial communities in the human microbiome and in the environment, computational tools will be necessary to summarize their global functional activity and systems-level regulatory interactions. In the long term, by providing methodology to understand the human microbiome at the molecular level, we hope to enable its future use as a diagnostic indicator and as a point of intervention to improve human health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful. Although we can now gather data on the cellular behavior of these microbes and on their interactions with human beings, computational tools are needed to interpret this information. By developing new software to study these communities of microorganisms, we hope to eventually be able to detect when they may be causing disease and modify their composition to improve human health.              2 Project Narrative DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful.

"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses. There are no existing glioma case-control studies with sufficient numbers of biological samples and common epidemiologic data to conduct a comprehensive validation and replication study, or to address the issues of tumor heterogeneity as we will in this study.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.         There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed.

"Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool in many areas of biology and medicine. Recent techno- logical breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to sequence billions of bases quickly and cheaply. A number of NGS-based tools have been created, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Methyl- seq and exon/whole-genome sequencing, enabling a fundamentally new way of studying diseases, genomes and epigenomes. The widespread use of NGS-based methods calls for better and more efficient tools for the analysis and interpretation of the NGS high-throughput data. Although a number of computational tools have been devel- oped, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes. In this project, computational algorithms and software that expand genomic accessibility of NGS to these previously understudied regions will be developed.  The algorithms will begin with a new way of mapping raw reads from NGS to the reference genome, followed by a machine learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads, and will be integrated into a comprehen- sive analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq. More specifically, the three aims of the research are to develop: (1) Data structures and efficient algorithms for read mapping to rapidly identify all mapping locations. Unlike existing methods, the focus of this research is to rapidly identify all candidate locations of each read, instead of one or only a few locations. (2) Machine learning algorithms for read analysis to resolve ambiguously mapped reads for both ChIP-seq analysis and genetic variation detection. This work will develop probabilistic models to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads. (3) A comprehensive ChIP- seq analysis pipeline to systematically study genomic features located within unmappable regions of genomes. These algorithms will be tested and refined using both publicly available data and data from established wet-lab collaborators.  In addition to discovering new genomic features located within repeat, duplicated or other previously unac- cessible regions, this work will provide the NGS community with (a) a faster and more accurate tool for mapping short sequence reads, (b) a general methodology for expanding genomic accessibility of NGS, and (c) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms for NGS data analysis, (d) a comprehensive analysis of protein-DNA interactions in repeat regions in all publicly available ChIP-seq datasets.  This work is a close collaboration between computer scientists and web-lab biologists who are developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems. In particular, we will collaborate with Timothy Osborne of Sanford- Burnham Medical Research Institute to study regulators involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, with Kyoko Yokomori of UC Irvine to study Cohesin, Nipbl and their roles in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and Ken Cho of UC Irvine to study the roles of FoxH1 and Schnurri in development and growth control.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms. Next-generation sequencing, which enables rapid generation of billions of bases at relatively low cost, poses a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the next-generation sequencing analysis tools, and thereby allowing biomedical researchers to take full advantage of next-generation sequencing to study biology and disease.              DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.         There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. Project Narrative  The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which  important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.  Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular  defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the  DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and  permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put  certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation  are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or  reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic  intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation,  including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an  important step in achieving this long-term goal.

"Functional activity and inter-organismal interactions in the human microbiome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput sequencing has provided a tool capable of observing the human microbiome, but characterizing the biological roles and metabolic potential of these microbial communities remains a significant challenge. Increasing evidence points to the functional activity of gene products, rather than community taxonomic composition, as the most robust descriptor of the microflora's relationship with its host and as a potential point of intervention in modulating human health. Existing computational tools for exploring a newly sequenced metagenome rely heavily on sequence homology and do not yet leverage information from the thousands of publicly available functional experimental results. Likewise, no previous methods have provided genome-scale computational tools for biological hypothesis generation regarding specific molecular interactions among the microflora and with a human host. This proposal aims to develop computational methodology to interpret the functional activity of microfloral communities: 1. Integrate functional information from taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic datasets. We will develop methodology to unify these three representations of microbiome composition by incorporating  information from large scale functional genomic data collections. 2. Identify genomic predictors of inter-species functional activity, including host/microflora interactions and points of community-wide regulatory feedback. We will computationally screen microbiome assays for molecular interactions and regulatory motifs spanning multiple organisms in the community. 3. Implement these technologies as publicly available, accessible, and interpretable tools. We will provide freely available, open source, downloadable and web-based implementations of this methodology for use  by the bioinformatic and biological communities. As high-throughput sequencing becomes more widely used to study microbial communities in the human microbiome and in the environment, computational tools will be necessary to summarize their global functional activity and systems-level regulatory interactions. In the long term, by providing methodology to understand the human microbiome at the molecular level, we hope to enable its future use as a diagnostic indicator and as a point of intervention to improve human health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful. Although we can now gather data on the cellular behavior of these microbes and on their interactions with human beings, computational tools are needed to interpret this information. By developing new software to study these communities of microorganisms, we hope to eventually be able to detect when they may be causing disease and modify their composition to improve human health.              2 Project Narrative DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful.

"Gene Prediction by Markov Models and Complementary Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the ab initio self-training algorithms for eukaryotic gene finding developed in the previous grant period in several important directions. First we will upgrade this algorithm to a multilevel data mining approach to allow construction of a consistent ""genome- transcriptome-proteome"" data structure at the early stages of a genome project. Here, we will compensate for an information deficit in various segments of experimental data (such as EST data) by unsupervised machine learning on existing and abundant data segments (an anonymous genomic sequence) with subsequent computational modeling of missing biological information (protein-coding genes and proteins). An important new feature of the self-training algorithm will be the utilization of protein level information to monitor and increase biological relevance of the models derived by the unsupervised iterative algorithm. Second, we will enhance the self-training algorithm developed earlier on a smaller scale and tested on fungal and other ""compact"" eukaryotic genomes (such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) to work with most complex eukaryotic genomes. At this higher level of complexity we see species with host genes occupying just a small fraction of genome which can be inhomogeneous in GC composition, populated with transposable elements and pseudogenes (besides animal genomes, genomes of some fungal pathogens as well as human parasites and their vectors fall into this category). Third, for the human microbiome containing bacterial, archaeal, viral and fungal species, situated at yet another end of the genome in homogeneity spectrum, we will develop improved algorithms and tools for ab initio gene identification. This work will be done in close contact with sequencing and annotation groups from leading genome centers both in the US and abroad.           NARRATIVE Rational systems biology, cancer cure, vaccine development, drug design, is impossible without understanding genomic DNA in human cell.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics   Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.   In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person.

"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). We will continue to make available ReliefF algorithms as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategies to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). We anticipate the proposed machine learning methods will provide powerful new approaches for identifying genetic variations that are predictive of cancer susceptibility.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The technology to measure information about the human genome is advancing at a rapid pace. Despite these advance, the computational methods for analyzing the data have not kept pace. We will develop new computer algorithms and software that can be used to identify genetic biomarkers of common human diseases.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.         There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.

"A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR FINE-SCALE GENOME WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic regulation of gene expression through variation in DNA methylation plays a critical role in a range of biological processes including cellular differentiation, human disease and cancer. New methods for determining the fine structure of methylation patterns genome-wide have led to an explosion of research in this field. Methylation near the gene promoter is correlated with gene silencing, while unmethylated promoters are potentially active. Current computational methods classify genes as either methylated and silenced or unmethylated and potentially active based on a coarse calculation of CpG methylation state across a window of a few hundred base pairs around the transcription start site. The detailed spatial pattern of methylation across the promoter may be an important determinant of gene expression, but current computational methods ignore this valuable information. Recent work has found regions proximal to CpG island promoters, dubbed ""CpG island shores"", whose methylation state correlates with transcription. CpG island shores are loosely defined, however, and this concept is difficult to apply in practice. While other methylation signatures are also likely to correlate with gene expression, a general framework to identify and study them has not been established. New computational tools for identification and correlation of detailed methylation patterns with gene expression are critical for advancing our understanding of the epigenetics of gene regulation. We propose to develop software tools to detect new methylation signatures at gene promoters that correlate with expression. This will be done within a formal framework so that these signatures can be used to determine differentially methylated genes in a variety of study designs. Taking advantage of the fact  that methylation over short ranges are highly correlated, we will interpolate methylation data at individual  CpG sites in a 10 kb window around the TSS to yield a methylation signature at each promoter that is  independent of primary sequence features. We will then use a metric from topology, the discrete Frechet distance, to calculate the similarity between methylation signatures, and apply this metric to cluster signatures of similar type. We will then determine clusters with methylation signatures that correlate with expression.  Clusters that contain both silenced and expressed genes will be examined to see if other local primary sequence features can be used to discriminate the genes based on expression. This approach will be used to detect methylation changes in case-control studies and in pairwise comparisons, such as needed for timecourse analysis or for the detection of different states of differentiation. The general framework developed here can be expanded in the future to examine methylation signatures at enhancers and gene bodies, as well as to histone marks or other genomic signals that carry detailed spatial information.          Narrative  DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine in CpG dinucleotides, is an important  epigenetic regulator of gene expression in cells. DNA methylation has been implicated in a large number of  biological processes including cellular differentiation and cancer. We will develop software tools to analyze  data from new techniques for mapping DNA methylation genome-wide to discover new methylation signatures  that are associated with silenced and active genes. These will include tools to use these signatures to  determine what genes are differentially regulated in different cell types and in human disease.",A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR FINE-SCALE GENOME WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS,8500440,R21LM011199,"['Algorithms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Cells ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' 2(1H)-Pyrimidinone, 4-amino- ', ' Cytosine ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Explosion ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Histones ', ' In Vitro ', ' Learning ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Protein Methylation ', ' Methylation ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Time ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' cytosine-guanine dinucleotide ', "" cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine "", ' cytidine monophosphate guanosine ', ' CG-dinucleotide ', "" 3'-5'-CpG "", ' CpG dinucleotide ', ' Enhancers ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' CpG-Rich Islands ', ' CpG Islands ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' methyl group ', ' Gene Inactivation ', ' Gene Silencing ', ' Base Pairing ', ' Structure ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Metric ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' spatial neglect ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' software development ', ' Genomics ', ' Transcription Start Site ', ' Transcription Initiation Site ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Resolution ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Process ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' human disease ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' ']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,135645,0.05121972525320855

"Global Predictions and Tests of Erythroid Regulation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper regulation of gene expression is essential to the normal development and health of organisms, whereas aberrant gene regulation is known to cause many genetic diseases, including some inherited anemias, and it is thought to be a major contributor to complex phenotypes such as susceptibility to common diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation may provide novel candidates for therapeutic interventions. Our studies aim for a deeper molecular understanding of global aspects of gene regulation in an important biological process, the maturation of erythroid precursor cells to become red blood cells. Building on our progress using patterns in sequence alignments to predict cis-regulatory modules for erythroid genes and deciphering functional correlations of their evolutionary history, we propose to acquire genome-wide information on biochemical features associated with regulation to reach a more complete understanding of gene regulation in erythroid cells. Specifically, we propose to use high throughput biochemical assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to microarrays and deep re-sequencing to acquire data on genomic DNA sequences (Aim 1) occupied in vivo by critical tissue-specific transcription factors, (Aim 2) bound by histones with modifications associated with gene activation or repression, (Aim 3) in chromatin with an altered structure, and (Aim 4) transcribed in a mouse erythroid cell model that undergoes maturation upon restoration of the critical transcription factor GATA-1. Then we will (Aim 5) apply existing software and develop new data-processing algorithms to determine peaks of signals that are likely to represent the locations of the features targeted in aims 1-4. Aim 6 will mine the peak-calling results, along with raw data, multiple sequence alignments and other information to investigate their covariation structure and integrate them to predict cis-regulatory modules, classify the modules by function, identify motifs associated with specific protein occupancy, and deduce the phylogenetic depth of preservation of critical motifs in the regulatory modules. Aim 7 will experimentally test biological hypotheses that arise from the analyses in Aims 6 and 7, determining the extent to which we can validate the locations of protein occupancy and transcripts, the predictions of both positive and negative cis-regulatory modules by gain-of-function cell transfection assays, and the role of motifs implicated in occupancy by directed mutagenesis and in vivo binding assays. We will test whether the motif- constraint hypothesis for protein-occupied DNA segments involved in enhancement applies to transcription factors in addition to GATA-1, and we will conduct additional experiments probing deeper biological issues. This research will provide not only global insights into mechanisms and effects of gene regulation during erythroid maturation, but the techniques and analytical tools developed here can be applied to better understand the development and differentiation of any tissue.

"Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool in many areas of biology and medicine. Recent techno- logical breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to sequence billions of bases quickly and cheaply. A number of NGS-based tools have been created, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Methyl- seq and exon/whole-genome sequencing, enabling a fundamentally new way of studying diseases, genomes and epigenomes. The widespread use of NGS-based methods calls for better and more efficient tools for the analysis and interpretation of the NGS high-throughput data. Although a number of computational tools have been devel- oped, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes. In this project, computational algorithms and software that expand genomic accessibility of NGS to these previously understudied regions will be developed.  The algorithms will begin with a new way of mapping raw reads from NGS to the reference genome, followed by a machine learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads, and will be integrated into a comprehen- sive analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq. More specifically, the three aims of the research are to develop: (1) Data structures and efficient algorithms for read mapping to rapidly identify all mapping locations. Unlike existing methods, the focus of this research is to rapidly identify all candidate locations of each read, instead of one or only a few locations. (2) Machine learning algorithms for read analysis to resolve ambiguously mapped reads for both ChIP-seq analysis and genetic variation detection. This work will develop probabilistic models to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads. (3) A comprehensive ChIP- seq analysis pipeline to systematically study genomic features located within unmappable regions of genomes. These algorithms will be tested and refined using both publicly available data and data from established wet-lab collaborators.  In addition to discovering new genomic features located within repeat, duplicated or other previously unac- cessible regions, this work will provide the NGS community with (a) a faster and more accurate tool for mapping short sequence reads, (b) a general methodology for expanding genomic accessibility of NGS, and (c) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms for NGS data analysis, (d) a comprehensive analysis of protein-DNA interactions in repeat regions in all publicly available ChIP-seq datasets.  This work is a close collaboration between computer scientists and web-lab biologists who are developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems. In particular, we will collaborate with Timothy Osborne of Sanford- Burnham Medical Research Institute to study regulators involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, with Kyoko Yokomori of UC Irvine to study Cohesin, Nipbl and their roles in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and Ken Cho of UC Irvine to study the roles of FoxH1 and Schnurri in development and growth control.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. Project Narrative  The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which  important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.  Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular  defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the  DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and  permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put  certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation  are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or  reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic  intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation,  including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an  important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at  risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential  biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.",Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers,8459567,R01CA132065,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Alu Repetitive Sequences ', ' Alu Family ', ' Alu Elements ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' NSCLC -

"The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria remains one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the developing world. The absence of a vaccine and the development of parasite resistance to commonly used antimalarial drugs underscore the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. The goal of this project is to generate insights into the mechanisms whereby Plas- modium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the most virulent form of malaria, regulates its genes' expression throughout its life cycle.  Mechanisms controlling gene expression in the parasite are still poorly understood. Increasing evidence indicates that control of gene expression in Plasmodium occurs at multiple levels, via local protein-DNA binding events, patterns of histone modifications, local chromatin structure and nucleosome occupancy, and large-scale chromatin structure. A variety of existing genome-wide data sets, including the genomic DNA sequence as well as measurements of RNA expression levels and nucleosome occupancy, provide insight into many aspects of this regulatory machinery. However, a global picture of the structure of DNA in the nucleus of the parasite is not yet available.  This project will apply a recently developed technology to map in Plasmodium all intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions at kilobase resolution throughout the parasite life cycle. These data will be used to build a dynamic three-dimensional model of the Plasmodium genome in vivo. The project will also generate a series of maps of histone modifications genome-wide. Finally, these two new data sets, along with existing data sets, will be integrated using machine learning methods to produce a predictive model of gene expression across the Plasmodium eryrthrocytic cycle.  Rational drug design requires a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of disease. By providing fundamental insight into the regulatory mechanisms of the malaria parasite, this project will improve our ability to design new drugs and novel lines of defense against malaria.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To develop effective strategies for combating malaria, we must understand the biology of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes the most lethal form of the disease. This project will use a recently developed technique to discover the spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome during the parasite infectious cycle. The resulting data will be integrated with newly generated patterns of histone modifications and will be used in combination with published genome-wide data sets to develop a computational model that will yield insights into transcriptional regulation in the human malaria parasite.            ",The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle,8557512,R01AI106775,"['Accounting ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antimalarial Drugs ', ' Antimalarial Agents ', ' Anti-Malarials ', ' Antimalarials ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Chromatin ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' DNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Drug Design ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red blood corpuscule ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Erythrocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood normocyte ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Malaria ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Parasite Control ', ' Parasites ', ' Plasmodium ', ' P.falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virulence ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Nuclear ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' vaccine development ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Chromosomal Structure ', ' Chromosomal Organization ', ' Chromosome Organization ', ' Chromosome Structures ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' DNA Structure ', ' Data ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecuar profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Virulent ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' 3D modeling ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resistant to Parasite ', ' resistance to Parasite ', ' parasite resistant ', ' Parasite resistance ', ' 3D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' Metabolic stress ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' Chip sequencing ', ' Chip seq ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,396836,0.0009887034751750183

"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses. There are no existing glioma case-control studies with sufficient numbers of biological samples and common epidemiologic data to conduct a comprehensive validation and replication study, or to address the issues of tumor heterogeneity as we will in this study.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gliomas are a rare and understudied disease that is rapidly fatal. The proposed case-control study of primary malignant glioma (Gliogene Consortium) includes 13-centers, and will address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases. It will identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma from a genome wide association study.

"From GWAS to PheWAS: Scanning the EMR phenome for gene-disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic medicine offers hope for improved diagnostic methods and for more effective, patient-specific therapies. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) elucidate genetic markers that improve understanding of risks and causes for many diseases, and may guide diagnosis and therapy on a patient-specific basis. This project will take another approach to identify gene-disease associations: perform ""reverse GWAS,"" or phenome- wide association study (PheWAS), to determine which phenotypes are associated with a given genotype. The project is enabled by a large DNA biobank coupled to a de- identified copy of the electronic medical record. This project has four specific aims. First, the project will develop and validate a standardized approach to extract disease phenotypes from EMR records, integrating national standard terminologies of clinical disorders and descriptors relating to treatment and diagnosis of each disease to create a sharable knowledge base. The project will use natural language processing, structured data queries, and heuristic and machine learning methods to accurately identify patients with each disease and corresponding controls. The second aim is to perform PheWAS analyses using existing genotype data. To validate the method, the project will use PheWAS to ""rediscover"" SNPs with known disease associations. The project will also investigate statistical methods for large-scale multiple hypothesis testing to discover novel phenotype associations. The third aim is to apply the PheWAS algorithms in four other sites with EMR-linked DNA biobanks and compare results. In the fourth aim, the project will validate novel phenotype-genotype associations discovered through PheWAS with new genotyping in a previously untested population. The tools generated from this project will not only make PheWAS possible, but will also broadly enable clinical research and subsequent genetic studies.           The promise of genomic medicine is to predict individuals' disease risk and treatment given their genetic information.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics   Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).  Building on these findings, in this proposal we will complete two specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: To provide comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence generation and analysis for deafness genetic testing  Goal 1: Comprehensive, high-throughput, low-cost DNA sequence analysis for genetic testing for deafness is possible at sensitivities and specificities comparable to Sanger sequencing by using targeted sequence enrichment followed by massively parallel sequencing.  Specific Aim 2: To optimize both machine learning-based audioprofiling of audiometric data and phenotypic filtering of genotypic data by expanding and improving the platform we have developed called AudioGene  Goal 2: As a phenome tool, a machine-learning software system trained on an extensive set of audiometric data can be used to predict and to eliminate specific genes or gene variants as causes of deafness based on audiometric data.  Achieving these specific aims will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history, physical examination and audiological assessment.   In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. Achieving this goal will change the clinical evaluation of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons by making genetic testing the most important diagnostic test after a history and physical exam.",Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics,8514562,R01DC012049,"['Audiometric Test ', ' Audiogram ', ' Audiometry ', ' Bar Codes ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Deafness ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks) ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-6 weeks old ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' Laboratories ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Persons ', ' Octogenarian ', ' Patients ', ' Medical Inspection ', ' Physical Examination ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Vestibular Aqueduct ', ' Generations ', ' Diagnostic tests ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' DNA Sequence Analyses ', ' DNA Sequence Analysis ', ' base ', ' Laryngoscopes ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Selection Criteria ', ' retinitis pigmentosa-congenital deafness syndrome ', ' dystrophia retinae-dysacousis syndrome ', ' dystrophia retinae pigmentosa-dysostosis syndrome (DRD) ', ' dystrophia retinae pigmentosa-dysostosis syndrome ', "" Usher's syndrome "", ' Usher syndrome (US) ', ' Usher Syndrome ', ' Hallgren syndrome ', ' Graefe-Usher syndrome ', ' Retinitis pigmentosa-deafness syndrome ', ' low frequency hearing loss ', ' Low Frequency Deafness ', ' Genetic ', ' Genets ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Sensory ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Persons With Hearing Impairments ', ' Hard of Hearing Persons ', ' Deaf ', ' Hearing Impaired Persons ', ' meetings ', ' trait ', ' genetic testing ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Hypoacusis ', ' Hypoacuses ', ' Hearing Loss ', ' hearing impairment ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Sanger Sequencing ', ' Dideoxy Chain Termination DNA Sequencing ', ' High Prevalence ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' cost ', ' software systems ', ' Minority ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' driving force ', ' Impairment ', ' phenome ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2013,588237,0.03976989345707308
"Integrating epigenomic maps to predict regulatory functions of genetic variants     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental illnesses are some of the most devastating diseases affecting human populations, placing a huge burden on individuals, families and society. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified dozens of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with psychiatric diseases, but a majority of those SNPs have been mapped to intergenic or intronic regions and are functionally unclassified. Existing software or algorithms only query multiple databases and produce lists of hits without intelligent integration and ignore much of the valuable regulatory information. The overall goal of this proposal is to integrate all available genetic, genomic and epigenomic data to generate a probability-based prediction about a SNP's influence on gene expression level in brain. Our previous studies have shown that psychiatric GWAS signals are enriched with brain eQTL SNPs (eSNPs), and these brain eSNPs are likely to be functional and contribute to disease susceptibilities. We will use SNPs in eQTLs to anchor a chain of evidence incorporating histone marks, conserved sequences, transcription factor binding sites, DNA methylation, accessible chromatins, non-coding RNA, and other data. We will use a machine learning method to predict regulatory SNPs based on known relationships between these epigenetic marks and their target genes, as well as their distinct patterns in genome. We will also use our novel unsupervised deconvolution algorithm to extract cell-type (i.e., neuron vs. non-neuron) specific measures from heterogeneous brain tissue data to improve our predictions. We will use both statistical and experimental methods to validate the predictions. Quantitative PCR and CRISPR-cas9 will be used on induced pluripotent cell lines to compare gene expression levels of alleles of predicted functional SNPs. Both algorithm and predicted functional variants will made public via a website and standalone application. The novel algorithm will significantly improve our understanding of psychiatric disease genetics by uncovering the gene-regulatory functions for disease-associated, non-coding SNPs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of common SNPs associated with major complex diseases, but the majority of those SNPs are located in non-coding regions, leaving those genetic associations functionally unexplained. Existing functional predication software or algorithms only query some databases without providing statistical or biological integration, and dismiss much valuable regulatory information. We propose to integrate all the available genetic, genomic and epigenomic data and use machine learning to produce a probability-based prediction about a SNP's influence on gene expression levels in brain. We will also use a novel unsupervised deconvolution algorithm to extract cell-type specific measures from heterogeneous brain tissue data to improve our prediction. We will use both statistical and experimental methods to validate the predictions. Both algorithm and predicted functional variants will be made public via a website and standalone application.

"Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool in many areas of biology and medicine. Recent techno- logical breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to sequence billions of bases quickly and cheaply. A number of NGS-based tools have been created, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Methyl- seq and exon/whole-genome sequencing, enabling a fundamentally new way of studying diseases, genomes and epigenomes. The widespread use of NGS-based methods calls for better and more efficient tools for the analysis and interpretation of the NGS high-throughput data. Although a number of computational tools have been devel- oped, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes. In this project, computational algorithms and software that expand genomic accessibility of NGS to these previously understudied regions will be developed.  The algorithms will begin with a new way of mapping raw reads from NGS to the reference genome, followed by a machine learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads, and will be integrated into a comprehen- sive analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq. More specifically, the three aims of the research are to develop: (1) Data structures and efficient algorithms for read mapping to rapidly identify all mapping locations. Unlike existing methods, the focus of this research is to rapidly identify all candidate locations of each read, instead of one or only a few locations. (2) Machine learning algorithms for read analysis to resolve ambiguously mapped reads for both ChIP-seq analysis and genetic variation detection. This work will develop probabilistic models to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads. (3) A comprehensive ChIP- seq analysis pipeline to systematically study genomic features located within unmappable regions of genomes. These algorithms will be tested and refined using both publicly available data and data from established wet-lab collaborators.  In addition to discovering new genomic features located within repeat, duplicated or other previously unac- cessible regions, this work will provide the NGS community with (a) a faster and more accurate tool for mapping short sequence reads, (b) a general methodology for expanding genomic accessibility of NGS, and (c) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms for NGS data analysis, (d) a comprehensive analysis of protein-DNA interactions in repeat regions in all publicly available ChIP-seq datasets.  This work is a close collaboration between computer scientists and web-lab biologists who are developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems. In particular, we will collaborate with Timothy Osborne of Sanford- Burnham Medical Research Institute to study regulators involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, with Kyoko Yokomori of UC Irvine to study Cohesin, Nipbl and their roles in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and Ken Cho of UC Irvine to study the roles of FoxH1 and Schnurri in development and growth control.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms. Next-generation sequencing, which enables rapid generation of billions of bases at relatively low cost, poses a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the next-generation sequencing analysis tools, and thereby allowing biomedical researchers to take full advantage of next-generation sequencing to study biology and disease.            ",Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing,8683213,R01HG006870,"['Algorithms ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Exons ', ' Foundations ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' muscle dystrophy ', ' Myodystrophy ', ' Myodystrophica ', ' Muscular Dystrophies ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Engineering ', ' Computer Software Development ', ' Software Engineering ', ' Testing ', ' transcription factor ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Medical Research ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Sequence Analyses ', ' SEQ-AN ', ' Sequence Analysis ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' typus amstelodamensis ', ' status degenerativus amstelodamensis ', ' de Lange syndrome 2 ', ' de Lange syndrome 1 ', ' congenital muscular hypertrophy-cerebral syndrome ', ' Typus Degenerativus Amstelodamensis ', ' Lange syndrome 2 ', ' Lange syndrome 1 Amsterdam dwarf ', ' De Lange Syndrome ', ' Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2 ', ' Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CLS) 2 ', ' Cornelia de Lange 1 ', ' Cornelia de Lange (CDL) syndrome (CLS) 1 ', ' Cornelia De Lange Syndrome ', ' Brachmann-De Lange Syndrome ', ' Brachmann-Cornelia de Lange syndrome ', ' Brachmann-Cornelia de Lange (BCDL) syndrome ', ' Amsterdam type ', ' Bruck-de Lange syndrome ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Location ', ' Fatty Acid Metabolism Pathway ', ' fatty acid metabolism ', ' Speed ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' cohesin ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' genome sequencing ', ' DNA-Protein Interaction ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Collection ', ' cost ', ' insertion/deletion ', ' insertion-deletion mutation ', ' insertion-deletion ', ' insertion/deletion mutation ', ' Facioscapulohumeral ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' computer algorithm ', ' Computational algorithm ', ' open source ', ' public health relevance ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' xenopus development ', ' Chip sequencing ', ' Chip seq ', ' RNA-seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' epigenome ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2014,221252,0.017649043988351126
"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses. There are no existing glioma case-control studies with sufficient numbers of biological samples and common epidemiologic data to conduct a comprehensive validation and replication study, or to address the issues of tumor heterogeneity as we will in this study.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gliomas are a rare and understudied disease that is rapidly fatal. The proposed case-control study of primary malignant glioma (Gliogene Consortium) includes 13-centers, and will address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases. It will identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma from a genome wide association study.

"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape  Title: Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape PI: Rohs, Remo (USC); Co-I: Noble, William Stafford (UW); Co-I: Tullius, Thomas D. (BU) PROJECT SUMMARY Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription factors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.            ",Genome analysis based

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.         There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.

"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The experimental approach to test the above hypothesis consists of the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the developmental and generational aspects of the genome-wide germline epimutations. Aim 2) Determine the genomic features associated with the epimutations and potential genetic alterations involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. Aim 3) Determine the optimal exposure parameters of the environmental induced transgenerational model and correlate epigenetic biomarkers with exposure and disease. Completion of the proposed research will determine the cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The proposed research will further elucidate the molecular and developmental aspects of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral exposure and disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease.

"Gene Prediction by Markov Models and Complementary Methods DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the ab initio self-training algorithms for eukaryotic gene finding developed in the previous grant period in several important directions. First we will upgrade this algorithm to a multilevel data mining approach to allow construction of a consistent ""genome- transcriptome-proteome"" data structure at the early stages of a genome project. Here, we will compensate for an information deficit in various segments of experimental data (such as EST data) by unsupervised machine learning on existing and abundant data segments (an anonymous genomic sequence) with subsequent computational modeling of missing biological information (protein-coding genes and proteins). An important new feature of the self-training algorithm will be the utilization of protein level information to monitor and increase biological relevance of the models derived by the unsupervised iterative algorithm. Second, we will enhance the self-training algorithm developed earlier on a smaller scale and tested on fungal and other ""compact"" eukaryotic genomes (such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) to work with most complex eukaryotic genomes. At this higher level of complexity we see species with host genes occupying just a small fraction of genome which can be inhomogeneous in GC composition, populated with transposable elements and pseudogenes (besides animal genomes, genomes of some fungal pathogens as well as human parasites and their vectors fall into this category). Third, for the human microbiome containing bacterial, archaeal, viral and fungal species, situated at yet another end of the genome in homogeneity spectrum, we will develop improved algorithms and tools for ab initio gene identification. This work will be done in close contact with sequencing and annotation groups from leading genome centers both in the US and abroad.

"CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop novel computational methods to identify regulatory elements in repetitive regions of the genomes using publicly available data from Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE. Half of the human genome is derived from transposable elements (TEs). These highly repetitive elements were recently shown to harbor transcription factor (TF) binding sites and epigenetic regulatory signals. TEs have shaped gene regulatory networks during evolution and are dysregulated in many diseases. However, the extent to which TEs contribute to regulatory networks, and how TE sequences evolved from parasitic DNA to functional elements, remains unclear. In this proposal, we introduce a computational framework to identify TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers and to estimate the evolutionary impact of TEs to cell type-specific gene regulation. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to develop an epigenomics-based approach to detect TE-derived enhancers and their target genes. Extending our recent success in developing machine learning methods to integrate DNA methylation data, we will bring to bear computational models that allow us to predict TE-derived enhancers. If successful, not only will we produce the largest catalog of TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers, but also have created a robust framework for detecting the contributions of TEs to gene regulation in any cell type or tissue. In Specific Aim 2 we will develop a TE epigenetic association assay. By taking advantage of the multi-copy nature of TE sequences, we will identify TE sequence variations or features that associate with specific epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will reconstruct sequences of the evolutionary intermediates of candidate TEs and estimate their epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will address questions including whether particular classes of TEs gained TF-binding sites and then spread quickly, or whether TEs first spread and later gained TF binding sites. If successful, we will develop an understanding of what sequence features drive the functional potential of TEs, and the modes of evolution followed by different TEs during regulatory network evolution. Such an understanding will dramatically improve our picture of regulatory network evolution by including the effects of TEs, a major class of fast evolving regulatory sequences that have been largely ignored in functional genomics studies. In Specific Aim 3 we will create a public resource based on our newly invented Repeat Element Browser to allow investigators to display, analyze, compare, and integrate Roadmap/ENCODE data and their own data on TEs. The methods developed in this proposal will have a high impact on the utility of data produced by consortia such as ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and TCGA, which currently discard most TE derived sequences. Such improvement will in turn accelerate research into understanding the impact of TEs on normal gene regulation and in human diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transposable elements (TEs) are a special class of DNA sequences which copy themselves and ""hop"" to many different locations in the genome. TEs are often referred to as ""junk"" DNA or ""parasitic"" DNA, but they are more and more implicated in genome evolution, gene regulation and diseases. These elements comprise a huge fraction of the DNA in mammalian genomes, including 50% of the human genome. Because of their repetitive nature they are generally discarded in most genomics studies. We recently showed that these elements often carry regulatory sequences that are co-opted by host genomes to perform normal gene regulation. Here we propose to study the extent to which TEs contribute to normal gene regulation throughout the genome and how mis-regulation of TE derived sequences contributes to disease.            ",CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS,8815597,R01ES024992,"['Attention ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cataloging ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Data Display ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Transposable Elements ', ' DNA Transposable Elements ', ' Elements ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Health ', ' Housing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Protein Methylation ', ' Methylation ', ' Parasites ', ' Play ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Trees ', ' Enhancers ', ' Repetitive Regions ', ' Repetitive Element ', ' Repetitive Sequence ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Funding ', ' gene function ', ' Shapes ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' success ', ' gene desert ', ' Junk DNA ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Genomics ', ' Genetic Processes ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' epigenomics ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' mammalian genome ', ' human disease ', ' public health relevance ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' epigenome ', ' ']",NIEHS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,189100,-0.013344994902067368
"Machine Learning Prediction of Cancer Susceptibility DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Susceptibility to sporadic forms of cancer is determined by numerous genetic factors that interact in a nonlinear manner in the context of an individual's age and environmental exposure. This complex genetic architecture has important implications for the use of genome-wide association studies for identifying susceptibility genes. The assumption of a simple architecture supports a strategy of testing each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually using traditional univariate statistics followed by a correction for multiple tests. However, a complex genetic architecture that is characteristic of most types of cancer requires analytical methods that specifically model combinations of SNPs and environmental exposures. While new and novel methods are available for modeling interactions, exhaustive testing of all combinations of SNPs is not feasible on a genome- wide scale because the number of comparisons is effectively infinite. Thus, it is critical that we develop intelligent strategies for selecting subsets of SNPs prior to combinatorial modeling. The objective of this renewal application is to continue the development of a research strategy for the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility. To accomplish this objective, we will continue developing and evaluating modifications and extensions to the ReliefF family of algorithms for selecting or filtering subsets of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (AIM 1). We will continue developing and evaluating a stochastic wrapper or search strategy for MDR analysis of interactions that utilizes ReliefF values as a heuristic (AIM 2). We will continue to make available ReliefF algorithms as part of our open-source MDR software package (AIM 3). Finally, we will apply the best ReliefF-MDR analysis strategies to the detection, characterization, and interpretation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in large genome-wide association studies of bladder cancer susceptibility (AIM 4). We anticipate the proposed machine learning methods will provide powerful new approaches for identifying genetic variations that are predictive of cancer susceptibility. PROJECT NARRATIVE The technology to measure information about the human genome is advancing at a rapid pace. Despite these advance, the computational methods for analyzing the data have not kept pace. We will develop new computer algorithms and software that can be used to identify genetic biomarkers of common human diseases.

"EDAC: ENCODE Data Analysis Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project is to provide a complete inventory of all functional elements in the human genome using high-throughput experiments as well as computational methods. This proposal aims to create the ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC, or the DAC), consisting of a multi-disciplinary group of leading scientists who will respond to directions from the Analysis Working Group (AWG) of ENCODE and thus integrate data generated by all groups in the ENCODE Consortium in an unbiased manner. These analyses will substantially augment the value of the ENCODE data by integrating diverse data types. The DAC members are leaders in their respective fields of bioinformatics, computational machine learning, algorithm development, and statistical theory and application to genomic data (Zhiping Weng, Manolis Kellis, Mark Gerstein, Mark Daly, Roderic Guigo, Shirley Liu, Rafael Irizarry, and William Noble). They have a strong track record of delivering collaborative analysis in the context of the ENCODE and modENCODE Projects, in which this group of researchers was responsible for the much of the analyses and the majority of the figures and tables in the ENCODE and modENCODE papers. The proposed DAC will pursue goals summarized as the following seven aims: Aim 1. To work with the AWG to define and prioritize integrative analyses of ENCODE data; Aim 2.To provide shared computational guidelines and infrastructure for data processing, common analysis tasks, and data exchange; Aim 3. To facilitate and carry out data integration for element-specific analyses; Aim 4.To facilitate and carry out exploratory data analyses across elements; Aim 5.To facilitate and carry out comparative analyses across human, mouse, fly, and worm; Aim 6.To facilitate integration with the genome-wide association studies community and disease datasets; and Aim 7.To facilitate writing Consortium papers and assist evaluating ENCODE data.         RELEVANCE: The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project is a coordinated effort to apply high-throughput, cost-efficient approaches to generate a comprehensive catalog of functional elements in the human genome.

"The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria remains one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the developing world. The absence of a vaccine and the development of parasite resistance to commonly used antimalarial drugs underscore the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. The goal of this project is to generate insights into the mechanisms whereby Plas- modium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the most virulent form of malaria, regulates its genes' expression throughout its life cycle.  Mechanisms controlling gene expression in the parasite are still poorly understood. Increasing evidence indicates that control of gene expression in Plasmodium occurs at multiple levels, via local protein-DNA binding events, patterns of histone modifications, local chromatin structure and nucleosome occupancy, and large-scale chromatin structure. A variety of existing genome-wide data sets, including the genomic DNA sequence as well as measurements of RNA expression levels and nucleosome occupancy, provide insight into many aspects of this regulatory machinery. However, a global picture of the structure of DNA in the nucleus of the parasite is not yet available.  This project will apply a recently developed technology to map in Plasmodium all intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions at kilobase resolution throughout the parasite life cycle. These data will be used to build a dynamic three-dimensional model of the Plasmodium genome in vivo. The project will also generate a series of maps of histone modifications genome-wide. Finally, these two new data sets, along with existing data sets, will be integrated using machine learning methods to produce a predictive model of gene expression across the Plasmodium eryrthrocytic cycle.  Rational drug design requires a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of disease. By providing fundamental insight into the regulatory mechanisms of the malaria parasite, this project will improve our ability to design new drugs and novel lines of defense against malaria.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To develop effective strategies for combating malaria, we must understand the biology of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes the most lethal form of the disease. This project will use a recently developed technique to discover the spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome during the parasite infectious cycle. The resulting data will be integrated with newly generated patterns of histone modifications and will be used in combination with published genome-wide data sets to develop a computational model that will yield insights into transcriptional regulation in the human malaria parasite.            ",The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle,8675801,R01AI106775,"['Accounting ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antimalarial Drugs ', ' Antimalarial Agents ', ' Anti-Malarials ', ' Antimalarials ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Chromatin ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' DNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Drug Design ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red blood corpuscule ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Erythrocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood normocyte ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Malaria ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Parasite Control ', ' Parasites ', ' Plasmodium ', ' P.falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virulence ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Nuclear ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' vaccine development ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Chromosome Organization ', ' Chromosomal Structure ', ' Chromosomal Organization ', ' Chromosome Structures ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' DNA Structure ', ' Data ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Virulent ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' 3D modeling ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resistant to Parasite ', ' resistance to Parasite ', ' parasite resistant ', ' Parasite resistance ', ' 3D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' Metabolic stress ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' Chip sequencing ', ' Chip seq ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' gDNA ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,454989,0.0009887034751750183
"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK.        The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data. With this grant we will improve these tools, make them more robust, and extend them to new sequencing technologies.

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics   Project Summary  In this goal-driven proposal, submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) Number PAR-11-003, we will make comprehensive genetic testing for deafness available to clinicians for under $500 per person. The driving force behind this initiative is the frequency of hearing impairment. As the most common sensory impairment, it is diagnosed in 1 of every 500 newborns and 50% of octogenarians (Morton Ann N Y Acad Sci 1991). With 57 genes implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), it is also an extremely heterogeneous trait and presents a tremendous challenge to diagnosis.  Current strategies for genetic testing for deafness are inadequate. For most, only a minority of genes is included, with selection criteria typically reflecting: 1) high prevalence as a cause of deafness (i.e. GJB2); 2) association with another recognizable feature (i.e. SLC26A4 and enlarged vestibular aqueduct); or 3) a recognizable audioprofile (i.e. low frequency hearing loss as seen with WFS1) (Hilgert et al Mut Res 2009).  The recent advent of powerful DNA target enrichment and sequencing technologies, however, makes it possible to provide comprehensive genetic testing for deafness that is efficient and cost-effective. We have shown that it is possible to analyze all deafness genes simultaneously on a single platform (called OtoSCOPE) (Shearer et al PNAS 2010). Related to this endeavor, we have also validated AudioGene as a phenotypic tool that uses patient audiograms to predict the genetic cause of ADNSHL (Hildebrand et al Genet Med 2008; Hildebrand et al Laryngoscope 2009).

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD. There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.",Epigenome

The goal of this project is to generate insights into the mechanisms whereby Plas- modium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the most virulent form of malaria, regulates its genes' expression throughout its life cycle.  Mechanisms controlling gene expression in the parasite are still poorly understood. Increasing evidence indicates that control of gene expression in Plasmodium occurs at multiple levels, via local protein-DNA binding events, patterns of histone modifications, local chromatin structure and nucleosome occupancy, and large-scale chromatin structure. A variety of existing genome-wide data sets, including the genomic DNA sequence as well as measurements of RNA expression levels and nucleosome occupancy, provide insight into many aspects of this regulatory machinery. However, a global picture of the structure of DNA in the nucleus of the parasite is not yet available.  This project will apply a recently developed technology to map in Plasmodium all intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions at kilobase resolution throughout the parasite life cycle. These data will be used to build a dynamic three-dimensional model of the Plasmodium genome in vivo. The project will also generate a series of maps of histone modifications genome-wide. Finally, these two new data sets, along with existing data sets, will be integrated using machine learning methods to produce a predictive model of gene expression across the Plasmodium eryrthrocytic cycle.  Rational drug design requires a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of disease. By providing fundamental insight into the regulatory mechanisms of the malaria parasite, this project will improve our ability to design new drugs and novel lines of defense against malaria. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To develop effective strategies for combating malaria, we must understand the biology of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes the most lethal form of the disease. This project will use a recently developed technique to discover the spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome during the parasite infectious cycle. The resulting data will be integrated with newly generated patterns of histone modifications and will be used in combination with published genome-wide data sets to develop a computational model that will yield insights into transcriptional regulation in the human malaria parasite.",The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle,8862371,R01AI106775,"['Accounting ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antimalarial Drugs ', ' Antimalarial Agents ', ' Anti-Malarials ', ' Antimalarials ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Division Cycle ', ' Cell Cycle ', ' Nucleus ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Chromatin ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' DNA-Binding Proteins ', ' Drug Design ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red blood corpuscule ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Erythrocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood normocyte ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' Exhibits ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Laboratories ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Plasmodium Infections ', ' Paludism ', ' Malaria ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Microscopy ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Parasite Control ', ' Parasites ', ' Plasmodium ', ' P.falciparum ', ' P. falciparum ', ' Plasmodium falciparum ', ' Play ', ' Publishing ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Vaccines ', ' Virulence ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Nuclear ', ' development of a vaccine ', ' develop a vaccine ', ' vaccine development ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Agreement ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Chromosome Organization ', ' Chromosomal Structure ', ' Chromosomal Organization ', ' Chromosome Structures ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' DNA Structure ', ' Data ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Virulent ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' 3D modeling ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resistant to Parasite ', ' resistance to Parasite ', ' parasite resistant ', ' Parasite resistance ', ' 3D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' Metabolic stress ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' combat ', ' novel therapeutic approach ', ' new therapeutic intervention ', ' new therapeutic approach ', ' novel therapeutic intervention ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' gDNA ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,451989,0.0009887034751750183
"International Case Control Study of Malignant Glioma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioma comprises about 40% of all primary brain tumors accounting for as many as 26,000 U.S. and European deaths annually. Inherited susceptibility plays a role with 2-fold increased risk of glioma among first-degree relatives of glioma cases. We initiated a multi-center, international linkage study: ""Genetic Epidemiology of Glioma International Consortium"" in 2007 to address the role of inherited susceptibility. Since this study does not allow us currently to address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases, we propose this case- control study to address this gap. Members of the consortium have conducted genome wide association studies (GWAS) that will be the discovery phase (phase I). While of high value for discovery, we propose to recruit 6,000 newly diagnosed glioma cases and 6,000 age-gender-ethnicity-matched controls, and collect detailed epidemiologic data and biologic samples from the 13 participating Gliogene sites. We hypothesize that novel inherited variation influencing the susceptibility to glioma can be identified by high density SNP analysis, and propose the following specific aims: SA1: Identify common genetic variants contributing to the risk of glioma. We plan to conduct phases 2 and 3 of the 3 phase approach, specifically we will: (SA1a) Validate GWAS findings from the discovery sets, and replicate the top hits (~23,000 SNPs) with lowest p- values from the two phase GWA studies in a series of 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls (phase 2, validation). Validate the top hits from the test set (aim 1a). From stage 2, genes with SNPs displaying an association at pd10-4 (including the complete haplotype tagging - approximately 100 SNPs) will then be genotyped in a further series of 4,000 cases and 4,000 controls (stage 3, validation). SNPs significant at 10-7 or better will be considered in the final analyses. (SA1b). Using an a priori hypothesis that DNA repair in inflammation contribute to glioma risk, we will selectively interrogate DNA repair and inflammation pathway genes using data for select genes derived from the high-density array. We will conduct a hypothesis driven genetic association in DNA repair and in inflammation/immune function related genes with glioma risk using functional genomic and bioinformatic tools to interrogate available databases. (SA2): Evaluate gene-gene (G-G) and gene- environmental (G-E) interactions with strong biologic relevance to identify G-G and G-E interactions for glioma risk using machine-learning tools (MDR, FITF, and CART) in these exploratory analyses. There are no existing glioma case-control studies with sufficient numbers of biological samples and common epidemiologic data to conduct a comprehensive validation and replication study, or to address the issues of tumor heterogeneity as we will in this study. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gliomas are a rare and understudied disease that is rapidly fatal. The proposed case-control study of primary malignant glioma (Gliogene Consortium) includes 13-centers, and will address the role of genetic susceptibility in sporadic cases.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD. There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.",Epigenome

"Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that can lead to bone marrow failure and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is characteristic of this disorder and, as such, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DMTis) are often used to treat MDS in lieu of conventional chemotherapies that have proven to be ineffective for this disease. However, even with DMTi therapy, only about one third of MDS patients achieve a clinical response leading to a survival benefit. Moreover, current DMTi-based regimens for MDS require a minimum of 6 months of treatment before a patient can be deemed resistant to this therapy. Given that only ~30-40% of patients respond to this treatment, the majority of patients will spend 6 months receiving a therapy to which they are unlikely to respond. Therefore, the identification of molecular differences that distinguish between sensitive and resistant patients at the time of diagnosis is critical in order to harness these differences for the development of molecular biomarkers predictive of DMTi response. These biomarkers would allow us to more accurately risk-stratify these patients and prevent unwarranted and ineffective therapy for resistant patients. Using next-generation sequencing technology we performed genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression and mutational analysis on a cohort of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), an MDS/MPN overlap syndrome, including both sensitive and resistant patients to the DMTi Decitabine (DAC). We found that robust epigenetic and gene expression differences exist between DMTi responders and non-responders. From these differences, we were able to develop an epigenetic classifier that predicts response to decitabine therapy in these patients with 87% accuracy. Moreover, using RNA-seq we identified a gene expression signature associated with primary resistance to DAC in CMML. Based on these data, we hypothesize that comparable differences are likely to be found in MDS patients who are either sensitive or resistant to the DMTi Azacytidine (AZA), and that these too have the potential to be used as the basis of a molecular classifier of response as well as to identify mechanisms of primary resistance to the drug. We propose to perform genome-wide studies DNA methylation and expression studies in a cohort of 250 MDS patients treated with AZA in order to identify DNA methylation and expression biomarkers predictive of response to this agent in MDS. From these studies, we expect to be able to develop clinically useful biomarkers that can be translated to CLIA-compatible technologies that can be applied in molecular diagnostics labs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most common hematological disorder of the elderly. To date, the only effective therapies are the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (Azacytidine and Decitabine), but even with this therapy, approximately 60% of patients do not respond. Currently there are no accurate molecular biomarkers that may help risk-stratify patients at the time of diagnosis, and therefore a vast majority of patients are forced to receive up to 6 months of Azacytidine before they can be offered alternative therapies. Moreover, it is unclear why some patients respond while others don't. Therefore, it is of the utmost urgency that we develop more accurate ways of risk-stratifying patients at the time of diagnosis in order to prevent the unwarranted treatment of a large fraction of patients who are unlikely to ever respond to these agents as well as to identify novel alternative therapeutic targets.            ",Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes,8979977,R01HL126947,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' ladakamycin ', ' Azacytidine ', ' AZC ', ' 5-Azacytidine ', ' 5-Aza-cytidine ', ' 5-AC ', ' 5 AZC ', ' 4-Amino-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-1,3,5-triazin-2(1H)-one ', ' Azacitidine ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' cytopenia ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' Exons ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' Hematopoietic Cellular Control Mechanisms ', ' Hematopoiesis ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Introns ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' acute myeloid leukemia ', ' acute granulocytic leukemia ', ' Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ', ' Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia ', ' AML - Acute Myeloid Leukemia ', ' Leukemia, Myelocytic, Acute ', ' Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic ', ' myelodysplasia ', ' Smoldering Leukemia ', ' Myelodysplastic Syndromes ', ' Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes ', ' Bone marrow failure ', ' Pancytopenia ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' genetic promoter element ', ' Promotor Regions (Genetics) ', ' Promotor Regions ', ' Promoter Regions ', ' Promoter Regions (Genetics) ', ' genetic regulatory element ', ' Regulatory Regions, Nucleic Acid (Genetics) ', ' Regulatory Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulator Regions ', ' Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Syndrome ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Dezocitidine ', ' Deoxyazacytidine ', ' 5-deoxyazacytidine ', ' 5-Azadeoxycytidine ', ' 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine ', "" 5-Aza-2'deoxycytidine/Decitabine "", "" 2'-Deoxy-5-azacytidine "", ' Decitabine ', ' Enhancers ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' peripheral blood ', ' CpG-Rich Islands ', ' CpG Islands ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' cancer chemotherapy ', ' Quimioterapia ', ' Combination Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy, Cancer, General ', ' Chemotherapy Regimen ', ' Chemotherapy Protocol ', ' Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' Alternative Therapies ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Ineffective Hematopoiesis ', ' b-TG1 ', ' THBGB1 ', ' THBGB ', ' TGB1 ', ' SCYB7 ', ' NAP-2-L1 ', ' LA-PF4 ', ' CXCL7 ', ' CTAPIII ', ' CTAP3 ', ' PPBP gene ', ' DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor ', ' Data ', ' Hypermethylation ', ' molecular signature ', ' molecular profile ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' Expression Signature ', ' Expression Profiling ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' in vivo ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' therapy resistant ', ' epigenomics ', ' next generation ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' chemotherapy ', ' therapeutic target ', ' genome-wide analysis ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' Regimen ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA-seq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' epigenetic biomarker ', ' epigenetic marker ', ' epigenome ', ' Massively Parallel Sequencing ', ' Massively Parallel DNA Sequencing ', ' Massive Parallel Sequencing ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,404125,0.09634808292963973
"Toward Diagnostics and Therapies of Molecular Subcategories of CAD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and in the US. While the genetics of this disease are intrinsically complex, thanks to huge research investments during the last 5-10 years, particularly in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a more unbiased, data-driven and realistic view of CAD has been achieved. As part of this achievement, ~160 common risk loci for CAD/myocardial infarction (MI) have been identified. An important task is now to understand the molecular mechanisms/pathways by which these loci exert risk for CAD/MI allowing to translating the initial findings into new therapies and diagnostics. However, since the loci identified thus far explain only ~10% of variation in CAD/MI risk, it is also essential to define additional CAD pathways operating in parallel with GWA loci. In recent years, clinical studies that consider intermediate phenotypes (between DNA and disease) have greatly enhanced interpretations of risk loci identified in GWA datasets. In addition, disease networks that can be identified from intermediate molecular phenotypes provide an essential framework to identify novel CAD pathways and targets for new CAD therapies. Over the last 6 years, we have performed a clinical study considering many intermediate phenotypes in CAD patients (the STARNET study). In this proposal we intend to use newly generated DNA genotype and RNA sequence data from the STARNET study to identify atherosclerosis and metabolic networks underlying CAD. We then propose a new prospective study of CAD (the NGS-PREDICT study) with the main purpose of validating findings from the STARNET study. We hypothesize that the extent and stability of coronary lesions, thus clinical outcomes can be accurately assessed by defining the status of key atherosclerosis gene networks. In turn, metabolic networks active in liver, abdominal fat, and skeletal muscle influence the status of the atherosclerosis gene networks. In addition, molecular data isolated from easily obtainable tissues (e.g., blood, subcutaneous fat and plasma) can be used to identify biomarkers that can predict risk for clinical events caused by CAD. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: To identify regulatory Bayesian gene networks causally linked to CAD and/or CAD sub-phenotypes using the STARNET datasets and the CARDIoGRAM meta-analysis GWA datasets. Aim 2: Identify biomarkers predicting clinical events of CAD (reflected in SYNTAX score) by applying machine learning on DNA genotype, RNA sequence and CAD plasma protein data from easily obtainable tissues of the STARNET cases. Aim 3: To validate the identified causal CAD eQTLs/networks and the biomarkers using the NGS-PREDICT study performed at the Mt. Sinai Hospital, the Swedish Twin study and CAD cell and animal models. We believe the proposed studies can lead to a significantly better molecular understanding of CAD and thus, serve the more long-term goal of preventive and personalized therapies of CAD patients diagnosed in well-defined molecular subcategories.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the world's leading cause of death. We will perform systems genetic analysis of DNA and RNAseq data from 9 CAD-relevant tissues in 700 well-characterized patients (STARNET) integrated with genome-wide association data to reveal CAD-causing metabolic and atherosclerosis gene networks, and within these, new inherited risk variants, CAD-mechanisms, therapeutic targets and biomarkers will be identified and validated in a new prospective clinical study of CAD (NGS-PREDICT).

"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK. The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data.

"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The experimental approach to test the above hypothesis consists of the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the developmental and generational aspects of the genome-wide germline epimutations. Aim 2) Determine the genomic features associated with the epimutations and potential genetic alterations involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. Aim 3) Determine the optimal exposure parameters of the environmental induced transgenerational model and correlate epigenetic biomarkers with exposure and disease. Completion of the proposed research will determine the cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The proposed research will further elucidate the molecular and developmental aspects of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral exposure and disease.

"Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput whole genome platforms to quantitatively and efficiently assay human DNA methylation provide an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation of the 5' carbon of cytosine which occurs in the context of CpG dinucleotides, do not affect the genetic sequence; however, they do play a critical role in transcriptional regulation of a gene and subsequent gene expression. We have applied this technology, in conjunction with whole genome SNP genotyping to a clinically well-characterized collection of SS cases and controls developed specifically for genetic and epigenetic studies. Samples from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) repository (total n=3,500 individuals) will b utilized, given the careful phenotype characterization and standardized collection of biospecimens that has been performed for each participant. For this proposal, we have initially obtained DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sorted cell populations with high purity, including CD14+ monocytes, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, as well as labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from 120 SICCA participants (100 SS cases and 20 controls). Data collected for ~450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome will provide a comprehensive assessment of DNA methylation for each individual for our proposed study Aims. As part of Aim 1, DNA methylation profiles will be examined using three main approaches: 1) Global DNA methylation profiles will be analyzed for association with SS risk in all sample types; 2) Multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) and principal components analysis (PCA) will be performed to determine whether SS case samples can be distinguished from control samples; and 3) Local analyses will also be performed and will focus specifically on DNA methylation changes within candidate SS genes and genes demonstrating at least 1.5 fold methylation differences between cases and controls. Our proposal will take advantage of available whole genome data for each study participant and results from the largest genome wide association study (GWAS) in SS. In Aim 2, we will utilize DNA methylation profiles and methods from Aim 1 to determine whether important SS case phenotypes can be distinguished from one another. We will identify top ranked CpG sites that are either hypo or hyper methylated in specific SS case groups or that distinguish cases from controls using supervised machine learning algorithms. We will attempt replication for all top findings in an independent dataset, followed by random effects meta-analysis to incorporate other SS risk factors. Finally, we will determine whether DNA methylation profiles of interest from Aims 1 and 2 can be detected in DNA from whole blood for potential use as a biomarker. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of different cell and tissue types and genetic background have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE New molecular genetic assays offer an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS).

"Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in DNA sequencing have dramatically increased the availability of genomic variation data over the past few years. This development offers a powerful window into understanding the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk. To facilitate achieving this goal, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical methods that will allow researchers to more fuly utilize the information in genomic data and consider more complex models than previously possible. The central goal of this project is to tackle this important challenge, by carrying out te following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will develop efficient inference tools for whole-genome population genomic analysis by extending our ongoing work on coalescent hidden Markov models and apply them to large-scale data. The methods we develop will enable researchers to analyze large samples under general demographic models involving multiple populations with population splits, migration, and admixture, as well as variable effective population sizes and temporal samples (ancient DNA). Multi-locus full-likelihood computation is often prohibitive in most population genetic models with high complexity. To address this problem, we will develop in Aim 2 a novel likelihood-free inference framework for population genomic analysis by applying a highly active area of machine learning research called deep learning. We will apply the method to various parameter estimation and classification problems in population genomics, particularly joint inference of selection and demography. In addition to carrying out technical research, we will develop a useful software package that will allow researchers from the population genomics community to utilize deep learning in their own research. It is becoming increasingly more popular to utilize time-series genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale to infer allele frequency changes over a time course. This development creates new opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to estimate their associated fitness parameters. In Aim 3, we will develop new statistical methods to take full advantage of this novel data source at both short and long evolutionary timescales. Specifically, we will develop and apply efficient statistical inference methods for analyzing time-series genomic variation data from experimental evolution and ancient DNA samples. Useful open-source software will be developed for each specific aim. The novel methods developed in this project will help to analyze and interpret genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This project will develop several novel statistical methods for analyzing and interpreting human genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale.

"CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop novel computational methods to identify regulatory elements in repetitive regions of the genomes using publicly available data from Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE. Half of the human genome is derived from transposable elements (TEs). These highly repetitive elements were recently shown to harbor transcription factor (TF) binding sites and epigenetic regulatory signals. TEs have shaped gene regulatory networks during evolution and are dysregulated in many diseases. However, the extent to which TEs contribute to regulatory networks, and how TE sequences evolved from parasitic DNA to functional elements, remains unclear. In this proposal, we introduce a computational framework to identify TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers and to estimate the evolutionary impact of TEs to cell type-specific gene regulation. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to develop an epigenomics-based approach to detect TE-derived enhancers and their target genes. Extending our recent success in developing machine learning methods to integrate DNA methylation data, we will bring to bear computational models that allow us to predict TE-derived enhancers. If successful, not only will we produce the largest catalog of TE-derived cell type-specific enhancers, but also have created a robust framework for detecting the contributions of TEs to gene regulation in any cell type or tissue. In Specific Aim 2 we will develop a TE epigenetic association assay. By taking advantage of the multi-copy nature of TE sequences, we will identify TE sequence variations or features that associate with specific epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will reconstruct sequences of the evolutionary intermediates of candidate TEs and estimate their epigenetic and/or TF binding pattern. We will address questions including whether particular classes of TEs gained TF-binding sites and then spread quickly, or whether TEs first spread and later gained TF binding sites. If successful, we will develop an understanding of what sequence features drive the functional potential of TEs, and the modes of evolution followed by different TEs during regulatory network evolution. Such an understanding will dramatically improve our picture of regulatory network evolution by including the effects of TEs, a major class of fast evolving regulatory sequences that have been largely ignored in functional genomics studies. In Specific Aim 3 we will create a public resource based on our newly invented Repeat Element Browser to allow investigators to display, analyze, compare, and integrate Roadmap/ENCODE data and their own data on TEs. The methods developed in this proposal will have a high impact on the utility of data produced by consortia such as ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and TCGA, which currently discard most TE derived sequences. Such improvement will in turn accelerate research into understanding the impact of TEs on normal gene regulation and in human diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transposable elements (TEs) are a special class of DNA sequences which copy themselves and ""hop"" to many different locations in the genome. TEs are often referred to as ""junk"" DNA or ""parasitic"" DNA, but they are more and more implicated in genome evolution, gene regulation and diseases. These elements comprise a huge fraction of the DNA in mammalian genomes, including 50% of the human genome. Because of their repetitive nature they are generally discarded in most genomics studies. We recently showed that these elements often carry regulatory sequences that are co-opted by host genomes to perform normal gene regulation. Here we propose to study the extent to which TEs contribute to normal gene regulation throughout the genome and how mis-regulation of TE derived sequences contributes to disease.",CHARTING THE EPIGENOMIC LANDSCAPE OF HUMAN TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS,8928618,R01ES024992,"['Attention ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Cataloging ', ' Chromatin ', ' Communities ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Data Display ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Transposable Elements ', ' DNA Transposable Elements ', ' Elements ', ' Evolution ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Health ', ' Housing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Protein Methylation ', ' Methylation ', ' Parasites ', ' Play ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Trees ', ' Enhancers ', ' Repetitive Regions ', ' Repetitive Element ', ' Repetitive Sequence ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Funding ', ' gene function ', ' Shapes ', ' Deposit ', ' Deposition ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' success ', ' gene desert ', ' Junk DNA ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' functional genomics ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Genetic Processes ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' epigenomics ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' mammalian genome ', ' human disease ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' epigenome ', ' ']",NIEHS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,152500,-0.013344994902067368
"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns. Allelic dosage and random forest selection frequency (RFSF) analyses will be used to identify novel methylation quantitative trait loci within SS-associated genes in cases and controls (separately), and we will test whether cell-proportion or eQTLs can explain SS-specific methylation patterns.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic, highly heterogenous, multisystem autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women. This disease is known to be associated with epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, an axis of epigenetic variation that has been implicated as a mediator of disease risk in other autoimmune diseases. Full characterization of DNA methylation patterns across different cell types and affected tissues will provide new insights into disease etiology, phenotype classification, and targets for future therapeutic strategies.                ",Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome,8910299,F31DE025176,"['epigenome ', ' abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Inflammatory Arthritis ', ' Atrophic Arthritis ', ' Rheumatoid Arthritis ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' self recognition (immune) ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-Cells ', ' B blood cells ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' C element ', ' Carbon ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cell Separation ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' 2(1H)-Pyrimidinone, 4-amino- ', ' Cytosine ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fellowship ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Code ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE -

"Integrating epigenomic maps to predict regulatory functions of genetic variants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental illnesses are some of the most devastating diseases affecting human populations, placing a huge burden on individuals, families and society. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified dozens of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with psychiatric diseases, but a majority of those SNPs have been mapped to intergenic or intronic regions and are functionally unclassified. Existing software or algorithms only query multiple databases and produce lists of hits without intelligent integration and ignore much of the valuable regulatory information. The overall goal of this proposal is to integrate all available genetic, genomic and epigenomic data to generate a probability-based prediction about a SNP's influence on gene expression level in brain. Our previous studies have shown that psychiatric GWAS signals are enriched with brain eQTL SNPs (eSNPs), and these brain eSNPs are likely to be functional and contribute to disease susceptibilities. We will use SNPs in eQTLs to anchor a chain of evidence incorporating histone marks, conserved sequences, transcription factor binding sites, DNA methylation, accessible chromatins, non-coding RNA, and other data. We will use a machine learning method to predict regulatory SNPs based on known relationships between these epigenetic marks and their target genes, as well as their distinct patterns in genome. We will also use our novel unsupervised deconvolution algorithm to extract cell-type (i.e., neuron vs. non-neuron) specific measures from heterogeneous brain tissue data to improve our predictions. We will use both statistical and experimental methods to validate the predictions. Quantitative PCR and CRISPR-cas9 will be used on induced pluripotent cell lines to compare gene expression levels of alleles of predicted functional SNPs. Both algorithm and predicted functional variants will made public via a website and standalone application. The novel algorithm will significantly improve our understanding of psychiatric disease genetics by uncovering the gene-regulatory functions for disease-associated, non-coding SNPs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of common SNPs associated with major complex diseases, but the majority of those SNPs are located in non-coding regions, leaving those genetic associations functionally unexplained.

We propose to integrate all the available genetic, genomic and epigenomic data and use machine learning to produce a probability-based prediction about a SNP's influence on gene expression levels in brain.

"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the

"Toward Diagnostics and Therapies of Molecular Subcategories of CAD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and in the US. While the genetics of this disease are intrinsically complex, thanks to huge research investments during the last 5-10 years, particularly in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a more unbiased, data-driven and realistic view of CAD has been achieved. As part of this achievement, ~160 common risk loci for CAD/myocardial infarction (MI) have been identified. An important task is now to understand the molecular mechanisms/pathways by which these loci exert risk for CAD/MI allowing to translating the initial findings into new therapies and diagnostics. However, since the loci identified thus far explain only ~10% of variation in CAD/MI risk, it is also essential to define additional CAD pathways operating in parallel with GWA loci. In recent years, clinical studies that consider intermediate phenotypes (between DNA and disease) have greatly enhanced interpretations of risk loci identified in GWA datasets. In addition, disease networks that can be identified from intermediate molecular phenotypes provide an essential framework to identify novel CAD pathways and targets for new CAD therapies. Over the last 6 years, we have performed a clinical study considering many intermediate phenotypes in CAD patients (the STARNET study). In this proposal we intend to use newly generated DNA genotype and RNA sequence data from the STARNET study to identify atherosclerosis and metabolic networks underlying CAD. We then propose a new prospective study of CAD (the NGS-PREDICT study) with the main purpose of validating findings from the STARNET study. We hypothesize that the extent and stability of coronary lesions, thus clinical outcomes can be accurately assessed by defining the status of key atherosclerosis gene networks. In turn, metabolic networks active in liver, abdominal fat, and skeletal muscle influence the status of the atherosclerosis gene networks. In addition, molecular data isolated from easily obtainable tissues (e.g., blood, subcutaneous fat and plasma) can be used to identify biomarkers that can predict risk for clinical events caused by CAD. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: To identify regulatory Bayesian gene networks causally linked to CAD and/or CAD sub-phenotypes using the STARNET datasets and the CARDIoGRAM meta-analysis GWA datasets. Aim 2: Identify biomarkers predicting clinical events of CAD (reflected in SYNTAX score) by applying machine learning on DNA genotype, RNA sequence and CAD plasma protein data from easily obtainable tissues of the STARNET cases. Aim 3: To validate the identified causal CAD eQTLs/networks and the biomarkers using the NGS-PREDICT study performed at the Mt. Sinai Hospital, the Swedish Twin study and CAD cell and animal models. We believe the proposed studies can lead to a significantly better molecular understanding of CAD and thus, serve the more long-term goal of preventive and personalized therapies of CAD patients diagnosed in well-defined molecular subcategories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the world's leading cause of death. We will perform systems genetic analysis of DNA and RNAseq data from 9 CAD-relevant tissues in 700 well-characterized patients (STARNET) integrated with genome-wide association data to reveal CAD-causing metabolic and atherosclerosis gene networks, and within these, new inherited risk variants, CAD-mechanisms, therapeutic targets and biomarkers will be identified and validated in a new prospective clinical study of CAD (NGS-PREDICT).

"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9172062,R01HG009188,"['Affect ', ' C element ', ' Carbon ', ' Charge ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' DNA-Dependent DNA Polymerases ', ' DNA Polymerases ', ' DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase ', ' Single-Stranded DNA ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Hybrids ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Molecular Models ', ' Motion ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Noise ', ' Nucleotides ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' protein design ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Transistors ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' Individual ', ' enzyme activity ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Route ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' solid state ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Base Pairing ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' response ', ' nanotechnological ', ' nanotech ', ' nano-technological ', ' nano technology ', ' nano tech ', ' Nanotechnology ', ' single molecule ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Polymerase ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Enzyme Kinetics ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' nano electronics ', ' nanoelectronics ', ' nanometer sized ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nano scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nanoscale ', ' nano pore ', ' nanopore ', ' single walled carbon nano tube ', ' SWNT ', ' single walled carbon nanotube ', ' scale up ', ' Massive Parallel Sequencing ', ' Massively Parallel Sequencing ', ' Massively Parallel DNA Sequencing ', ' collaborative environment ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' Health Care Research ', ' healthcare research ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2016,584552,0.09980744328761414
"Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood Several million units of donor platelets are transfused annually in the US and Europe to treat patients undergoing radiation treatment, chemotherapy, or organ transplant surgery. Although transfusions of donor- derived platelets are an effective way to treat thrombocytopenic patients, numerous concerns have been raised due to the increase in demand, the five-day shelf-life, and the possibilities for contamination. Platelets are produced by megakaryocytes (MKs) in the bone marrow and are derived from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The long-term objective of this proposal is to generate platelets ex vivo from HSPC- enriched umbilical cord blood that will allow us to address a vast public need. Recent studies have shown that the addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) can greatly affect expansion of progenitor cells, but can reduce MK differentiation efficiency. My central hypothesis is that epigenetic and transcriptional changes prime or desensitize HSPC to MK differentiation cues. To investigate the role of epigenetic signals during HSPC-to- MK transition, I propose to perform high-throughput ChIP and RNA-sequencing to discover differentially active regulatory elements between expanded (low potential) and fresh cord blood HSPCs. This highly interdisciplinary and collaborative proposal utilizes computational biology and machine-learning to identify differentially active regulatory elements, and associate genetic features with MK fate. To validate my findings and establish a causal relationship between histone modifications of certain regions and MK potential, I will generate a dCas9-fusion protein that can directly manipulate the epigenetic marker at a targeted site. My findings will establish the mechanism of action of chromatin-modifying agents such as HDACi, and the causal relationship between the epigenome and MK differentiation. My highly collaborative proposal with the Miller, Bagheri, and Mahmud lab will substantially enhance our understanding of hematopoietic differentiation toward manufacturing platelets. Project Narrative More than two million platelet units from donors are used to treat patients undergoing surgery or chemotherapy every year, but short shelf-life, increasing demand, and risk of contamination keep platelets in strained supply. In my proposed study, I will apply a panel of small molecules to expand and differentiate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood into platelet-producing cells. My work will identify the role of epigenetic modifications during the culture process, and elucidate new strategies to efficiently manufacture platelets from culture.",Integrative Epigenetic Analysis

"Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that can lead to bone marrow failure and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is characteristic of this disorder and, as such, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DMTis) are often used to treat MDS in lieu of conventional chemotherapies that have proven to be ineffective for this disease. However, even with DMTi therapy, only about one third of MDS patients achieve a clinical response leading to a survival benefit. Moreover, current DMTi-based regimens for MDS require a minimum of 6 months of treatment before a patient can be deemed resistant to this therapy. Given that only ~30-40% of patients respond to this treatment, the majority of patients will spend 6 months receiving a therapy to which they are unlikely to respond. Therefore, the identification of molecular differences that distinguish between sensitive and resistant patients at the time of diagnosis is critical in order to harness these differences for the development of molecular biomarkers predictive of DMTi response. These biomarkers would allow us to more accurately risk-stratify these patients and prevent unwarranted and ineffective therapy for resistant patients. Using next-generation sequencing technology we performed genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression and mutational analysis on a cohort of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), an MDS/MPN overlap syndrome, including both sensitive and resistant patients to the DMTi Decitabine (DAC). We found that robust epigenetic and gene expression differences exist between DMTi responders and non-responders. From these differences, we were able to develop an epigenetic classifier that predicts response to decitabine therapy in these patients with 87% accuracy. Moreover, using RNA-seq we identified a gene expression signature associated with primary resistance to DAC in CMML. Based on these data, we hypothesize that comparable differences are likely to be found in MDS patients who are either sensitive or resistant to the DMTi Azacytidine (AZA), and that these too have the potential to be used as the basis of a molecular classifier of response as well as to identify mechanisms of primary resistance to the drug. We propose to perform genome-wide studies DNA methylation and expression studies in a cohort of 250 MDS patients treated with AZA in order to identify DNA methylation and expression biomarkers predictive of response to this agent in MDS. From these studies, we expect to be able to develop clinically useful biomarkers that can be translated to CLIA-compatible technologies that can be applied in molecular diagnostics labs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most common hematological disorder of the elderly. To date, the only effective therapies are the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (Azacytidine and Decitabine), but even with this therapy, approximately 60% of patients do not respond. Currently there are no accurate molecular biomarkers that may help risk-stratify patients at the time of diagnosis, and therefore a vast majority of patients are forced to receive up to 6 months of Azacytidine before they can be offered alternative therapies. Moreover, it is unclear why some patients respond while others don't. Therefore, it is of the utmost urgency that we develop more accurate ways of risk-stratifying patients at the time of diagnosis in order to prevent the unwarranted treatment of a large fraction of patients who are unlikely to ever respond to these agents as well as to identify novel alternative therapeutic targets.",Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes,9099915,R01HL126947,"['Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' ladakamycin ', ' Azacytidine ', ' AZC ', ' 5-Azacytidine ', ' 5-Aza-cytidine ', ' 5-AC ', ' 5 AZC ', ' Azacitidine ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' cytopenia ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' Exons ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Health ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' Hematopoietic Cellular Control Mechanisms ', ' Hematopoiesis ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Introns ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' acute myeloid leukemia ', ' acute granulocytic leukemia ', ' Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ', ' Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia ', ' AML -

"Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput whole genome platforms to quantitatively and efficiently assay human DNA methylation provide an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation of the 5' carbon of cytosine which occurs in the context of CpG dinucleotides, do not affect the genetic sequence; however, they do play a critical role in transcriptional regulation of a gene and subsequent gene expression. We have applied this technology, in conjunction with whole genome SNP genotyping to a clinically well-characterized collection of SS cases and controls developed specifically for genetic and epigenetic studies. Samples from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) repository (total n=3,500 individuals) will b utilized, given the careful phenotype characterization and standardized collection of biospecimens that has been performed for each participant. For this proposal, we have initially obtained DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sorted cell populations with high purity, including CD14+ monocytes, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, as well as labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from 120 SICCA participants (100 SS cases and 20 controls). Data collected for ~450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome will provide a comprehensive assessment of DNA methylation for each individual for our proposed study Aims. As part of Aim 1, DNA methylation profiles will be examined using three main approaches: 1) Global DNA methylation profiles will be analyzed for association with SS risk in all sample types; 2) Multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) and principal components analysis (PCA) will be performed to determine whether SS case samples can be distinguished from control samples; and 3) Local analyses will also be performed and will focus specifically on DNA methylation changes within candidate SS genes and genes demonstrating at least 1.5 fold methylation differences between cases and controls. Our proposal will take advantage of available whole genome data for each study participant and results from the largest genome wide association study (GWAS) in SS. In Aim 2, we will utilize DNA methylation profiles and methods from Aim 1 to determine whether important SS case phenotypes can be distinguished from one another. We will identify top ranked CpG sites that are either hypo or hyper methylated in specific SS case groups or that distinguish cases from controls using supervised machine learning algorithms. We will attempt replication for all top findings in an independent dataset, followed by random effects meta-analysis to incorporate other SS risk factors. Finally, we will determine whether DNA methylation profiles of interest from Aims 1 and 2 can be detected in DNA from whole blood for potential use as a biomarker. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of different cell and tissue types and genetic background have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE New molecular genetic assays offer an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS).

"Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in DNA sequencing have dramatically increased the availability of genomic variation data over the past few years. This development offers a powerful window into understanding the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk. To facilitate achieving this goal, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical methods that will allow researchers to more fuly utilize the information in genomic data and consider more complex models than previously possible. The central goal of this project is to tackle this important challenge, by carrying out te following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will develop efficient inference tools for whole-genome population genomic analysis by extending our ongoing work on coalescent hidden Markov models and apply them to large-scale data. The methods we develop will enable researchers to analyze large samples under general demographic models involving multiple populations with population splits, migration, and admixture, as well as variable effective population sizes and temporal samples (ancient DNA). Multi-locus full-likelihood computation is often prohibitive in most population genetic models with high complexity. To address this problem, we will develop in Aim 2 a novel likelihood-free inference framework for population genomic analysis by applying a highly active area of machine learning research called deep learning. We will apply the method to various parameter estimation and classification problems in population genomics, particularly joint inference of selection and demography. In addition to carrying out technical research, we will develop a useful software package that will allow researchers from the population genomics community to utilize deep learning in their own research. It is becoming increasingly more popular to utilize time-series genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale to infer allele frequency changes over a time course. This development creates new opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to estimate their associated fitness parameters. In Aim 3, we will develop new statistical methods to take full advantage of this novel data source at both short and long evolutionary timescales. Specifically, we will develop and apply efficient statistical inference methods for analyzing time-series genomic variation data from experimental evolution and ancient DNA samples. Useful open-source software will be developed for each specific aim. The novel methods developed in this project will help to analyze and interpret genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This project will develop several novel statistical methods for analyzing and interpreting human genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale.

"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B).

"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The experimental approach to test the above hypothesis consists of the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the developmental and generational aspects of the genome-wide germline epimutations. Aim 2) Determine the genomic features associated with the epimutations and potential genetic alterations involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. Aim 3) Determine the optimal exposure parameters of the environmental induced transgenerational model and correlate epigenetic biomarkers with exposure and disease. Completion of the proposed research will determine the cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The proposed research will further elucidate the molecular and developmental aspects of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral exposure and disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes will be determined.

"The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria remains one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the developing world. The absence of a vaccine and the development of parasite resistance to commonly used antimalarial drugs underscore the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. The goal of this project is to generate insights into the mechanisms whereby Plas- modium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the most virulent form of malaria, regulates its genes' expression throughout its life cycle.  Mechanisms controlling gene expression in the parasite are still poorly understood. Increasing evidence indicates that control of gene expression in Plasmodium occurs at multiple levels, via local protein-DNA binding events, patterns of histone modifications, local chromatin structure and nucleosome occupancy, and large-scale chromatin structure. A variety of existing genome-wide data sets, including the genomic DNA sequence as well as measurements of RNA expression levels and nucleosome occupancy, provide insight into many aspects of this regulatory machinery. However, a global picture of the structure of DNA in the nucleus of the parasite is not yet available.  This project will apply a recently developed technology to map in Plasmodium all intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions at kilobase resolution throughout the parasite life cycle. These data will be used to build a dynamic three-dimensional model of the Plasmodium genome in vivo. The project will also generate a series of maps of histone modifications genome-wide. Finally, these two new data sets, along with existing data sets, will be integrated using machine learning methods to produce a predictive model of gene expression across the Plasmodium eryrthrocytic cycle.  Rational drug design requires a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of disease. By providing fundamental insight into the regulatory mechanisms of the malaria parasite, this project will improve our ability to design new drugs and novel lines of defense against malaria. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To develop effective strategies for combating malaria, we must understand the biology of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes the most lethal form of the disease. This project will use a recently developed technique to discover the spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome during the parasite infectious cycle. The resulting data will be integrated with newly generated patterns of histone modifications and will be used in combination with published genome-wide data sets to develop a computational model that will yield insights into transcriptional regulation in the human malaria parasite.",The spatial organization of the Plasmodium genome throughout its infectious cycle,9067925,R01AI106775,"['Accounting

"Toward Diagnostics and Therapies of Molecular Subcategories of CAD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and in the US. While the genetics of this disease are intrinsically complex, thanks to huge research investments during the last 5-10 years, particularly in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a more unbiased, data-driven and realistic view of CAD has been achieved. As part of this achievement, ~160 common risk loci for CAD/myocardial infarction (MI) have been identified. An important task is now to understand the molecular mechanisms/pathways by which these loci exert risk for CAD/MI allowing to translating the initial findings into new therapies and diagnostics. However, since the loci identified thus far explain only ~10% of variation in CAD/MI risk, it is also essential to define additional CAD pathways operating in parallel with GWA loci. In recent years, clinical studies that consider intermediate phenotypes (between DNA and disease) have greatly enhanced interpretations of risk loci identified in GWA datasets. In addition, disease networks that can be identified from intermediate molecular phenotypes provide an essential framework to identify novel CAD pathways and targets for new CAD therapies. Over the last 6 years, we have performed a clinical study considering many intermediate phenotypes in CAD patients (the STARNET study). In this proposal we intend to use newly generated DNA genotype and RNA sequence data from the STARNET study to identify atherosclerosis and metabolic networks underlying CAD. We then propose a new prospective study of CAD (the NGS-PREDICT study) with the main purpose of validating findings from the STARNET study. We hypothesize that the extent and stability of coronary lesions, thus clinical outcomes can be accurately assessed by defining the status of key atherosclerosis gene networks. In turn, metabolic networks active in liver, abdominal fat, and skeletal muscle influence the status of the atherosclerosis gene networks. In addition, molecular data isolated from easily obtainable tissues (e.g., blood, subcutaneous fat and plasma) can be used to identify biomarkers that can predict risk for clinical events caused by CAD. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: To identify regulatory Bayesian gene networks causally linked to CAD and/or CAD sub-phenotypes using the STARNET datasets and the CARDIoGRAM meta-analysis GWA datasets. Aim 2: Identify biomarkers predicting clinical events of CAD (reflected in SYNTAX score) by applying machine learning on DNA genotype, RNA sequence and CAD plasma protein data from easily obtainable tissues of the STARNET cases. Aim 3: To validate the identified causal CAD eQTLs/networks and the biomarkers using the NGS-PREDICT study performed at the Mt. Sinai Hospital, the Swedish Twin study and CAD cell and animal models. We believe the proposed studies can lead to a significantly better molecular understanding of CAD and thus, serve the more long-term goal of preventive and personalized therapies of CAD patients diagnosed in well-defined molecular subcategories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the world's leading cause of death. We will perform systems genetic analysis of DNA and RNAseq data from 9 CAD-relevant tissues in 700 well-characterized patients (STARNET) integrated with genome-wide association data to reveal CAD-causing metabolic and atherosclerosis gene networks, and within these, new inherited risk variants, CAD-mechanisms, therapeutic targets and biomarkers will be identified and validated in a new prospective clinical study of CAD (NGS-PREDICT).

"Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma PROJECT SUMMARY Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common aggressive type of lymphomas, is characterized by marked clinical and pathological heterogeneity that is reflected at the molecular level. It is well known that although the incidence rates for DLBCL were lower for African Americans (AA) than for European Americans (EA), AA patients were diagnosed at a significantly younger age and have worse 5-year survival compared with EA patients. The reason for this apparent racial/ethnic difference is unclear and cannot be fully explained by social stressors or access to care. We speculate that epigenetic variations could underlie the racial/ethnic differences because the pathogenesis of DLBCL is strongly linked to perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms, and population-specific cytosine modifications are a fundamental feature between human populations. In addition, greater epigenetic heterogeneity is linked with more aggressive DLBCL and poorer survival outcomes. Most prior studies of DLBCL epigenetics have assessed 5-methylcytosines (5mC) in predominantly EA patients. No studies have evaluated 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), an emerging stable and abundant modification with distinct gene regulatory and cellular functions, due mainly to technical limitations. Most importantly, no studies have assessed concurrently 5mC and 5hmC in both EA and AA DLBCL patients. Without an effective technique to obtain the complete landscape of modified cytosines, development of targeted epigenetic approaches to improve DLBCL disparities is unlikely. The objective of this Exploratory/Developmental study is to distinguish 5hmC from 5mC at the time of DLBCL diagnosis between AA and EA patients and evaluate their clinical significance. Our hypothesis is that the 5mC/5hmC signatures in tumor tissues differ between AA and EA patients and that these differences contribute to the well-known racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL risk and outcomes. The Specific Aims are to 1) distinguish 5hmC from 5mC in EA and AA patients and evaluate population-specific 5mC/5hmC loci; and 2) determine therapeutic response-associated 5hmC/5mC loci. Specifically, we will obtain tissues for 120 patients with DLBCL (60 AA and 60 EA) from the University of Chicago Lymphoma Biobank. We will combine an innovative technique, the Tet-assisted Bisulfite Sequencing (TAB-Seq) and the new Illumina EPIC array to accurately distinguish 5hmC from 5mC. We will perform an epigenome-wide scan to assess differences in 5hmC/5mC modification levels between AA and EA patients at presentation and also integrate both modifications to predict therapeutic response, defined as relapse within 24 months after treatment. This proposal addresses a critical research question in a highly innovative, cost-efficient, and timely manner, providing important data for the first time on the complete landscape of modified cytosines for racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL. The results are expected to have positive impact because it is possible that the identified epigenetic loci/biomarkers will provide new targets for individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to decrease mortality and burden of DLBCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans were diagnosed of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most aggressive lymphoma in adults, at a significantly younger age (54 years vs. 65 years) and have worse 5-year survival (45% vs. 54%) compared with European American patients. This work seeks to understand the biological bases of the racial/ethnic differences by identifying complete DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation signatures at the time of diagnosis between African American and European American patients with DLBCL. Successful completion of this study will lead to a much better understanding of epigenetic factors that underlie the apparent racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL, which should accelerate the development of race-based individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to substantially reduce the disparities observed in DLBCL among patients from different ethnic groups.",Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma,9455051,R21MD011439,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Chicago ', ' Colon ', ' Cytosine ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Endometrium ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Lymphoma ', ' Reticulolymphosarcoma ', ' Malignant Lymphoma ', ' Germinoblastoma ', ' Germinoblastic Sarcoma ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Specificity ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Enhancers ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', "" large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma "", ' Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma ', ' DLBCL ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' American ', ' stressor ', ' tumor initiation ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' social ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Sampling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Tetanus Helper Peptide ', ' Tet ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' epigenomics ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' epigenetic variation ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' epigenetic marker ', ' epigenetic biomarker ', ' epigenome ', ' bisulfite sequencing ', ' bisulfite-seq ', ' BS-seq ', ' survival outcome ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2017,254325,0.023848197500146058

"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease.

"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9238054,R01DC011805,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Clostridium botulinum Toxins ', ' Botulin ', ' Botulinum Toxins ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communication ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Muscle Dystonia ', ' Dystonia ', ' Exhibits ', ' Genes ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Laryngeal muscle structure ', ' larynx muscle ', ' Laryngeal Muscles ', ' Larynx ', ' voice box ', ' Larynx Head and Neck ', ' Laryngeal ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Social isolation ', ' Spasm ', ' Muscular Spasm ', ' Muscle Spasm ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Voice ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family history of ', ' spasmodic dysphonia ', ' Spastic Dysphonias ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Oral ', ' Parietal ', ' Occupational ', ' Penetrance ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Focal Dystonias ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' symptom improvement ', ' improve symptom ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' exome sequencing ', ' screening ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Genetic study ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' imaging genetics ', ' translational impact ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNAseq ', ' DNA seq ', ' ']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,360556,-0.05401233736733895
"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that can lead to bone marrow failure and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is characteristic of this disorder and, as such, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DMTis) are often used to treat MDS in lieu of conventional chemotherapies that have proven to be ineffective for this disease. However, even with DMTi therapy, only about one third of MDS patients achieve a clinical response leading to a survival benefit. Moreover, current DMTi-based regimens for MDS require a minimum of 6 months of treatment before a patient can be deemed resistant to this therapy. Given that only ~30-40% of patients respond to this treatment, the majority of patients will spend 6 months receiving a therapy to which they are unlikely to respond. Therefore, the identification of molecular differences that distinguish between sensitive and resistant patients at the time of diagnosis is critical in order to harness these differences for the development of molecular biomarkers predictive of DMTi response. These biomarkers would allow us to more accurately risk-stratify these patients and prevent unwarranted and ineffective therapy for resistant patients. Using next-generation sequencing technology we performed genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression and mutational analysis on a cohort of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), an MDS/MPN overlap syndrome, including both sensitive and resistant patients to the DMTi Decitabine (DAC). We found that robust epigenetic and gene expression differences exist between DMTi responders and non-responders. From these differences, we were able to develop an epigenetic classifier that predicts response to decitabine therapy in these patients with 87% accuracy. Moreover, using RNA-seq we identified a gene expression signature associated with primary resistance to DAC in CMML. Based on these data, we hypothesize that comparable differences are likely to be found in MDS patients who are either sensitive or resistant to the DMTi Azacytidine (AZA), and that these too have the potential to be used as the basis of a molecular classifier of response as well as to identify mechanisms of primary resistance to the drug. We propose to perform genome-wide studies DNA methylation and expression studies in a cohort of 250 MDS patients treated with AZA in order to identify DNA methylation and expression biomarkers predictive of response to this agent in MDS. From these studies, we expect to be able to develop clinically useful biomarkers that can be translated to CLIA-compatible technologies that can be applied in molecular diagnostics labs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most common hematological disorder of the elderly. To date, the only effective therapies are the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (Azacytidine and Decitabine), but even with this therapy, approximately 60% of patients do not respond. Currently there are no accurate molecular biomarkers that may help risk-stratify patients at the time of diagnosis, and therefore a vast majority of patients are forced to receive up to 6 months of Azacytidine before they can be offered alternative therapies. Moreover, it is unclear why some patients respond while others don't. Therefore, it is of the utmost urgency that we develop more accurate ways of risk-stratifying patients at the time of diagnosis in order to prevent the unwarranted treatment of a large fraction of patients who are unlikely to ever respond to these agents as well as to identify novel alternative therapeutic targets.",Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes,9268794,R01HL126947,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Algorithms ', ' ladakamycin ', ' Azacytidine ', ' AZC ', ' 5-Azacytidine ', ' 5-Aza-cytidine ', ' 5-AC ', ' 5 AZC ', ' Azacitidine ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' cytopenia ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' Exons ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genome ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' Hematopoietic Cellular Control Mechanisms ', ' Hematopoiesis ', ' Introns ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Acute Myelocytic Leukemia ', ' acute myeloid leukemia ', ' acute granulocytic leukemia ', ' Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ', ' Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia ', ' AML -

"Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in DNA sequencing have dramatically increased the availability of genomic variation data over the past few years. This development offers a powerful window into understanding the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk. To facilitate achieving this goal, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical methods that will allow researchers to more fuly utilize the information in genomic data and consider more complex models than previously possible. The central goal of this project is to tackle this important challenge, by carrying out te following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will develop efficient inference tools for whole-genome population genomic analysis by extending our ongoing work on coalescent hidden Markov models and apply them to large-scale data. The methods we develop will enable researchers to analyze large samples under general demographic models involving multiple populations with population splits, migration, and admixture, as well as variable effective population sizes and temporal samples (ancient DNA). Multi-locus full-likelihood computation is often prohibitive in most population genetic models with high complexity. To address this problem, we will develop in Aim 2 a novel likelihood-free inference framework for population genomic analysis by applying a highly active area of machine learning research called deep learning. We will apply the method to various parameter estimation and classification problems in population genomics, particularly joint inference of selection and demography. In addition to carrying out technical research, we will develop a useful software package that will allow researchers from the population genomics community to utilize deep learning in their own research. It is becoming increasingly more popular to utilize time-series genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale to infer allele frequency changes over a time course. This development creates new opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to estimate their associated fitness parameters. In Aim 3, we will develop new statistical methods to take full advantage of this novel data source at both short and long evolutionary timescales. Specifically, we will develop and apply efficient statistical inference methods for analyzing time-series genomic variation data from experimental evolution and ancient DNA samples. Useful open-source software will be developed for each specific aim. The novel methods developed in this project will help to analyze and interpret genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This project will develop several novel statistical methods for analyzing and interpreting human genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale.

"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the

"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9535613,R01DC011805,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Clostridium botulinum Toxins ', ' Botulin ', ' Botulinum Toxins ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communication ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Muscle Dystonia ', ' Dystonia ', ' Exhibits ', ' Genes ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Laryngeal muscle structure ', ' larynx muscle ', ' Laryngeal Muscles ', ' Larynx ', ' voice box ', ' Larynx Head and Neck ', ' Laryngeal ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Social isolation ', ' Spasm ', ' Muscular Spasm ', ' Muscle Spasm ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Voice ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family history of ', ' spasmodic dysphonia ', ' Spastic Dysphonias ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Oral ', ' Parietal ', ' Occupational ', ' Penetrance ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Focal Dystonias ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' symptom improvement ', ' improve symptom ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' exome sequencing ', ' screening ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Genetic study ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' imaging genetics ', ' translational impact ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNAseq ', ' DNA seq ', ' ']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2017,365626,-0.05401233736733895
"Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease Project Summary Over the past decade, it has become clear that mixture between diverged populations (admixture) has been a recurrent feature in human evolution. It has also become evident that a detailed un- derstanding of admixture is essential for e ective disease gene mapping as well as evolutionary inference. Nevertheless, adequate analytical tools to dissect admixture and its impact on pheno- type are lacking. As a result, disease gene mapping or evolutionary studies have either excluded admixed populations or relied on simpli ed models at the risk of inaccurate inferences. This pro- posal proposes to develop computational methods to infer the genomic structure and history of admixed populations across a range of evolutionary time scales and to lever- age this structure to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture and evolution of complex phenotypes. The proposed methods will integrate power- ful sources of information from ancient DNA with genomes from present-day human populations. These methods will enable populations with a history of admixture to be studied just as e ectively as homogeneous populations. The rst step in obtaining a thorough understanding of admixture is a principled and scalable statis- tical framework to infer ne-scale genomic structure (local ancestry) and evolutionary relationships. This proposal leverages recent advances in statistical machine learning to develop e ective tools for the increasingly common and challenging problem of local ancestry inference where reference genomes for ancestral populations are unavailable (de-novo local ancestry). Further, the proposal intends to develop models to infer complex evolutionary histories as well as realistic mating patterns in admixed populations. These inferences will form the starting point to systematically understand how admixture has shaped phenotypes. For example, it is becoming clear that admixture between modern humans and archaic humans (Neanderthals and Denisovans) could have had a major im- pact on human phenotypes. This question will be explored by applying novel statistical methods to large genetic datasets with phenotypic measurements to assess the adaptive as well as phenotypic impact of Neanderthal alleles. Finally, large collections of genomes from extinct populations that are now becoming available due to advances in ancient DNA technologies can lead to vastly more powerful methods for evolutionary inference that overcome the limitation of methods that rely only on extant genomes. Statistical models that use ancient genome time-series to eciently infer admixture histories, local ancestry and selection will be developed. Project Narrative Although mixture events between human populations (admixture) are now known to have been common throughout human history and are likely to have had a major impact on human pheno- types, we lack adequate methods to study these processes. Our work will lead to a suite of powerful tools to understand the history of admixture, the impact of admixture on ne-scale genomic struc- ture and function. Our work not only lead to new insights into the genetic basis and evolution of complex phenotypes but will ensure that major population groups, many of whom descend from admixture events or from ancestral groups distinct from those of Europeans, can bene t from the advances in genomics.",Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease,9382936,R35GM125055,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Evolution ', ' Genome ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Phenotype ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' European ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' mate ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Population Group ', ' Admixture ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' reference genome ', ' reference assembly ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R35,2017,225087,0.025377890472555467

"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns. Allelic dosage and random forest selection frequency (RFSF) analyses will be used to identify novel methylation quantitative trait loci within SS-associated genes in cases and controls (separately), and we will test whether cell-proportion or eQTLs can explain SS-specific methylation patterns.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic, highly heterogenous, multisystem autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women. This disease is known to be associated with epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, an axis of epigenetic variation that has been implicated as a mediator of disease risk in other autoimmune diseases. Full characterization of DNA methylation patterns across different cell types and affected tissues will provide new insights into disease etiology, phenotype classification, and targets for future therapeutic strategies.                ",Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome,9240483,F31DE025176,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Atrophic Arthritis ', ' Rheumatoid Arthritis ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' auto-immune disorder ', ' auto-immune disease ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' Carbon ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Cytosine ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fellowship ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Code ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE -

"Inferring gene regulatory circuitry from functional genomics data PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been known that methylation of genomic DNA correlates with gene expression. However, the structural mechanisms that underlie these observations remain obscure. In this project, we will pursue several innovative strategies for studying how methylation affects transcription factor (TF) binding. First, we will use Methyl-SELEX-seq – a novel experimental method developed in the previous cycle of this grant that uses barcoded mixtures of methylated and unmethylated DNA ligands – to create detailed maps of the effect of methylation on binding affinity for a broad panel of human transcription factors from various structural families. Second, we will perform detailed computational analyses and follow-up experiments to test the hypothesis that methylation causes local changes in DNA shape, which in turn modify TF binding affinity. We have shown that adding a methyl group in the major groove changes the geometry of the minor groove and enhances the electrostatic interaction between negative charges in the DNA minor groove and positively charged amino- acids in the TF. We will extend these analyses to other DNA modifications, as well as a wider range of DNA shape parameters and associated flexibility parameters. By building interpretable TF-DNA recognition models that integrate base, shape, and flexibility features using a powerful new machine learning framework developed in the previous funding cycle, we will make specific predictions regarding sequence and methylation readout mechanisms, and validate these using SELEX experiments with mutated TFs. To assess to what extent our quantitative models for binding to naked DNA built from SELEX data are predictive of binding to genomic DNA in the context of the living cell, we will perform detailed parallel analyses of SELEX and ChIP- seq data for Hox proteins and other TFs. Finally, to study the relationship between DNA binding and gene expression control in human cell lines, we will exploit Survey of Regulatory Elements (SuRE-seq), a novel massively parallel reporter assay that provides unique information about the autonomous transcriptional activity for each of >108 overlapping genomic fragments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epigenetic modifications of the human genome are known to play a key role in development and disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. The main goal of this proposal is to develop and apply new experimental and computational tools for analyzing how the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA is influenced by cytosine methylation.

"Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood Several million units of donor platelets are transfused annually in the US and Europe to treat patients undergoing radiation treatment, chemotherapy, or organ transplant surgery. Although transfusions of donor- derived platelets are an effective way to treat thrombocytopenic patients, numerous concerns have been raised due to the increase in demand, the five-day shelf-life, and the possibilities for contamination. Platelets are produced by megakaryocytes (MKs) in the bone marrow and are derived from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The long-term objective of this proposal is to generate platelets ex vivo from HSPC- enriched umbilical cord blood that will allow us to address a vast public need. Recent studies have shown that the addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) can greatly affect expansion of progenitor cells, but can reduce MK differentiation efficiency. My central hypothesis is that epigenetic and transcriptional changes prime or desensitize HSPC to MK differentiation cues. To investigate the role of epigenetic signals during HSPC-to- MK transition, I propose to perform high-throughput ChIP and RNA-sequencing to discover differentially active regulatory elements between expanded (low potential) and fresh cord blood HSPCs. This highly interdisciplinary and collaborative proposal utilizes computational biology and machine-learning to identify differentially active regulatory elements, and associate genetic features with MK fate. To validate my findings and establish a causal relationship between histone modifications of certain regions and MK potential, I will generate a dCas9-fusion protein that can directly manipulate the epigenetic marker at a targeted site. My findings will establish the mechanism of action of chromatin-modifying agents such as HDACi, and the causal relationship between the epigenome and MK differentiation. My highly collaborative proposal with the Miller, Bagheri, and Mahmud lab will substantially enhance our understanding of hematopoietic differentiation toward manufacturing platelets. Project Narrative More than two million platelet units from donors are used to treat patients undergoing surgery or chemotherapy every year, but short shelf-life, increasing demand, and risk of contamination keep platelets in strained supply. In my proposed study, I will apply a panel of small molecules to expand and differentiate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood into platelet-producing cells. My work will identify the role of epigenetic modifications during the culture process, and elucidate new strategies to efficiently manufacture platelets from culture.",Integrative Epigenetic Analysis

"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes. The proposed training activities are designed to enhance the applicant's knowledge of epigenetics and physiology of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and to further his career as an independent investigator in the area of computational epigenetics for CVD.",Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data,9194309,K01HL124050,"['Physiologic Availability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Information Networks ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Software Tools ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' DNA analysis ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' gene interaction ', ' user friendly software ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Gene Proteins ', ' Protein Gene Products ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' inherited factor ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' histone modification ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Post-Transcriptional Regulation ', ' Post-Transcriptional Regulation Process ', ' Post-Transcriptional Control ', ' Prognostic Marker ', ' prognostic indicator ', ' prognostic biomarker ', ' Prognosis Marker ', ' Molecular Marker of Prognosis ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Exogenous Factors ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' disease phenotype ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Network-based ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' therapeutic target ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' epigenetic marker ', ' epigenetic biomarker ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' learning network ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' training opportunity ', ' multiple omics ', ' diagnostic biomarker ', ' diagnostic marker ', ' whole genome ', ' entire genome ', ' high dimensionality ', ' Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K01,2017,137416,0.08972417905729371

"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research.

"The UCLA Center in Early Detection of Liver Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of death in cirrhotic patients. This neoplasm is associated with liver cirrhosis in more than 90% of cases. A method of detecting HCC accurately in its early stages would greatly improve our ability to manage and treat the disease. The UCLA Center aims to develop an effective and affordable blood-based method for the early detection of liver cancer. Our team consists of translational and clinical researchers with multi-disciplinary expertise in the areas of early detection, biomarkers, cancer surveillance, imaging, and biorepositories. We will focus on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood. ctDNA carryies cancer-specific genetic and epigenetic aberrations, which enable a noninvasive `liquid biopsy' for cancer diagnosis. Our diagnostic test is based on the DNA methylation patterns of cfDNA. Our integrated computational and experimental technologies can significantly boost the diagnostic power while dramatically reducing the cost. We have the following aims: (1) We will establish a longitudinal cohort of cirrhotic patients. The cirrhotic patients will be subject to ultrasound imaging screening and blood sample collection every 6 months. The UCLA liver clinic sees ~1200 cirrhotic patients per year. (2) We will establish a state-of-the-art biospecimen repository that includes plasma from individuals in the cohort, tissue from liver tumors after resection, and cirrhotic lesions after liver transplantation. (3) We will perform Phase 2 clinical assay validation and Phase 3 early detection validation for the diagnostic test. (4) We will contribute to the collaborative trans-network activities.

"Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease Project Summary Over the past decade, it has become clear that mixture between diverged populations (admixture) has been a recurrent feature in human evolution. It has also become evident that a detailed un- derstanding of admixture is essential for e ective disease gene mapping as well as evolutionary inference. Nevertheless, adequate analytical tools to dissect admixture and its impact on pheno- type are lacking. As a result, disease gene mapping or evolutionary studies have either excluded admixed populations or relied on simpli ed models at the risk of inaccurate inferences. This pro- posal proposes to develop computational methods to infer the genomic structure and history of admixed populations across a range of evolutionary time scales and to lever- age this structure to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture and evolution of complex phenotypes. The proposed methods will integrate power- ful sources of information from ancient DNA with genomes from present-day human populations. These methods will enable populations with a history of admixture to be studied just as e ectively as homogeneous populations. The rst step in obtaining a thorough understanding of admixture is a principled and scalable statis- tical framework to infer ne-scale genomic structure (local ancestry) and evolutionary relationships. This proposal leverages recent advances in statistical machine learning to develop e ective tools for the increasingly common and challenging problem of local ancestry inference where reference genomes for ancestral populations are unavailable (de-novo local ancestry). Further, the proposal intends to develop models to infer complex evolutionary histories as well as realistic mating patterns in admixed populations. These inferences will form the starting point to systematically understand how admixture has shaped phenotypes. For example, it is becoming clear that admixture between modern humans and archaic humans (Neanderthals and Denisovans) could have had a major im- pact on human phenotypes. This question will be explored by applying novel statistical methods to large genetic datasets with phenotypic measurements to assess the adaptive as well as phenotypic impact of Neanderthal alleles. Finally, large collections of genomes from extinct populations that are now becoming available due to advances in ancient DNA technologies can lead to vastly more powerful methods for evolutionary inference that overcome the limitation of methods that rely only on extant genomes. Statistical models that use ancient genome time-series to eciently infer admixture histories, local ancestry and selection will be developed. Project Narrative Although mixture events between human populations (admixture) are now known to have been common throughout human history and are likely to have had a major impact on human pheno- types, we lack adequate methods to study these processes. Our work will lead to a suite of powerful tools to understand the history of admixture, the impact of admixture on ne-scale genomic struc- ture and function. Our work not only lead to new insights into the genetic basis and evolution of complex phenotypes but will ensure that major population groups, many of whom descend from admixture events or from ancestral groups distinct from those of Europeans, can bene t from the advances in genomics.",Statistical Models for Dissecting Human Population Admixture and its Role in Evolution and Disease,9547454,R35GM125055,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Chromosome Mapping ', ' genetic mapping ', ' Total Human and Non-Human Gene Mapping ', ' Linkage Mapping ', ' Gene Mapping Genetics ', ' Gene Mapping ', ' Gene Localization ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Evolution ', ' Genome ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Modernization ', ' Phenotype ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' European ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' mate ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Genomics ', ' Population Group ', ' genetic evolution ', ' Admixture ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' Population ', ' analytical tool ', ' reference assembly ', ' reference genome ', ' genetic architecture ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R35,2018,332952,0.025377890472555467
"Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that can lead to bone marrow failure and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is characteristic of this disorder and, as such, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DMTis) are often used to treat MDS in lieu of conventional chemotherapies that have proven to be ineffective for this disease. However, even with DMTi therapy, only about one third of MDS patients achieve a clinical response leading to a survival benefit. Moreover, current DMTi-based regimens for MDS require a minimum of 6 months of treatment before a patient can be deemed resistant to this therapy. Given that only ~30-40% of patients respond to this treatment, the majority of patients will spend 6 months receiving a therapy to which they are unlikely to respond. Therefore, the identification of molecular differences that distinguish between sensitive and resistant patients at the time of diagnosis is critical in order to harness these differences for the development of molecular biomarkers predictive of DMTi response. These biomarkers would allow us to more accurately risk-stratify these patients and prevent unwarranted and ineffective therapy for resistant patients. Using next-generation sequencing technology we performed genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression and mutational analysis on a cohort of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), an MDS/MPN overlap syndrome, including both sensitive and resistant patients to the DMTi Decitabine (DAC). We found that robust epigenetic and gene expression differences exist between DMTi responders and non-responders. From these differences, we were able to develop an epigenetic classifier that predicts response to decitabine therapy in these patients with 87% accuracy. Moreover, using RNA-seq we identified a gene expression signature associated with primary resistance to DAC in CMML. Based on these data, we hypothesize that comparable differences are likely to be found in MDS patients who are either sensitive or resistant to the DMTi Azacytidine (AZA), and that these too have the potential to be used as the basis of a molecular classifier of response as well as to identify mechanisms of primary resistance to the drug. We propose to perform genome-wide studies DNA methylation and expression studies in a cohort of 250 MDS patients treated with AZA in order to identify DNA methylation and expression biomarkers predictive of response to this agent in MDS. From these studies, we expect to be able to develop clinically useful biomarkers that can be translated to CLIA-compatible technologies that can be applied in molecular diagnostics labs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most common hematological disorder of the elderly. To date, the only effective therapies are the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (Azacytidine and Decitabine), but even with this therapy, approximately 60% of patients do not respond. Currently there are no accurate molecular biomarkers that may help risk-stratify patients at the time of diagnosis, and therefore a vast majority of patients are forced to receive up to 6 months of Azacytidine before they can be offered alternative therapies. Moreover, it is unclear why some patients respond while others don't. Therefore, it is of the utmost urgency that we develop more accurate ways of risk-stratifying patients at the time of diagnosis in order to prevent the unwarranted treatment of a large fraction of patients who are unlikely to ever respond to these agents as well as to identify novel alternative therapeutic targets.",Epigenetic biomarkers of response to Azacytidine in Myelodysplastic Syndromes,9483343,R01HL126947,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Azacitidine ', ' ladakamycin ', ' Azacytidine ', ' AZC ', ' 5-Azacytidine ', ' 5-Aza-cytidine ', ' 5-AC ', ' 5 AZC ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Bone Marrow ', ' Bone Marrow Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' cytopenia ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Drug resistance ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Exons ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genome ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hematopoiesis ', ' Hematopoietic Cellular Control Mechanisms ', ' Introns ', ' Intervening Sequences ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Acute Myelocytic Leukemia ', ' acute myeloid leukemia ', ' acute granulocytic leukemia ', ' Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ', ' Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia ', ' AML -

"Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma PROJECT SUMMARY Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common aggressive type of lymphomas, is characterized by marked clinical and pathological heterogeneity that is reflected at the molecular level. It is well known that although the incidence rates for DLBCL were lower for African Americans (AA) than for European Americans (EA), AA patients were diagnosed at a significantly younger age and have worse 5-year survival compared with EA patients. The reason for this apparent racial/ethnic difference is unclear and cannot be fully explained by social stressors or access to care. We speculate that epigenetic variations could underlie the racial/ethnic differences because the pathogenesis of DLBCL is strongly linked to perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms, and population-specific cytosine modifications are a fundamental feature between human populations. In addition, greater epigenetic heterogeneity is linked with more aggressive DLBCL and poorer survival outcomes. Most prior studies of DLBCL epigenetics have assessed 5-methylcytosines (5mC) in predominantly EA patients. No studies have evaluated 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC), an emerging stable and abundant modification with distinct gene regulatory and cellular functions, due mainly to technical limitations. Most importantly, no studies have assessed concurrently 5mC and 5hmC in both EA and AA DLBCL patients. Without an effective technique to obtain the complete landscape of modified cytosines, development of targeted epigenetic approaches to improve DLBCL disparities is unlikely. The objective of this Exploratory/Developmental study is to distinguish 5hmC from 5mC at the time of DLBCL diagnosis between AA and EA patients and evaluate their clinical significance. Our hypothesis is that the 5mC/5hmC signatures in tumor tissues differ between AA and EA patients and that these differences contribute to the well-known racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL risk and outcomes. The Specific Aims are to 1) distinguish 5hmC from 5mC in EA and AA patients and evaluate population-specific 5mC/5hmC loci; and 2) determine therapeutic response-associated 5hmC/5mC loci. Specifically, we will obtain tissues for 120 patients with DLBCL (60 AA and 60 EA) from the University of Chicago Lymphoma Biobank. We will combine an innovative technique, the Tet-assisted Bisulfite Sequencing (TAB-Seq) and the new Illumina EPIC array to accurately distinguish 5hmC from 5mC. We will perform an epigenome-wide scan to assess differences in 5hmC/5mC modification levels between AA and EA patients at presentation and also integrate both modifications to predict therapeutic response, defined as relapse within 24 months after treatment. This proposal addresses a critical research question in a highly innovative, cost-efficient, and timely manner, providing important data for the first time on the complete landscape of modified cytosines for racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL. The results are expected to have positive impact because it is possible that the identified epigenetic loci/biomarkers will provide new targets for individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to decrease mortality and burden of DLBCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans were diagnosed of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most aggressive lymphoma in adults, at a significantly younger age (54 years vs. 65 years) and have worse 5-year survival (45% vs. 54%) compared with European American patients. This work seeks to understand the biological bases of the racial/ethnic differences by identifying complete DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation signatures at the time of diagnosis between African American and European American patients with DLBCL. Successful completion of this study will lead to a much better understanding of epigenetic factors that underlie the apparent racial/ethnic differences in DLBCL, which should accelerate the development of race-based individualized preventive and therapeutic interventions to substantially reduce the disparities observed in DLBCL among patients from different ethnic groups.",Using epigenomic subtyping to understand the racial differences in lymphoma,9572405,R21MD011439,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell physiology ', ' Subcellular Process ', ' Cellular Process ', ' Cellular Physiology ', ' Cellular Function ', ' Cell Process ', ' Cell Function ', ' Chicago ', ' Colon ', ' Cytosine ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Endometrium ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Lymphoma ', ' Reticulolymphosarcoma ', ' Malignant Lymphoma ', ' Germinoblastoma ', ' Germinoblastic Sarcoma ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Specificity ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Enhancers ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', "" large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma "", ' Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma ', ' DLBCL ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Scanning ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Tumor Tissue ', ' American ', ' stressor ', ' tumor initiation ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' social ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Sampling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' therapy prediction ', ' predict treatment response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Tetanus Helper Peptide ', ' Tet ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' epigenomics ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' epigenetic variation ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' epigenetic biomarker ', ' epigenetic marker ', ' epigenome ', ' bisulfite-seq ', ' Bisulfite-based sequencing ', ' BS-seq ', ' bisulfite sequencing ', ' survival outcome ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2018,200434,0.023848197500146058
"Mathematical Models and Statistical Methods for Large-Scale Population Genomics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Technological advances in DNA sequencing have dramatically increased the availability of genomic variation data over the past few years. This development offers a powerful window into understanding the genetic basis of human biology and disease risk. To facilitate achieving this goal, it is crucial to develop efficient analytical methods that will allow researchers to more fuly utilize the information in genomic data and consider more complex models than previously possible. The central goal of this project is to tackle this important challenge, by carrying out te following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will develop efficient inference tools for whole-genome population genomic analysis by extending our ongoing work on coalescent hidden Markov models and apply them to large-scale data. The methods we develop will enable researchers to analyze large samples under general demographic models involving multiple populations with population splits, migration, and admixture, as well as variable effective population sizes and temporal samples (ancient DNA). Multi-locus full-likelihood computation is often prohibitive in most population genetic models with high complexity. To address this problem, we will develop in Aim 2 a novel likelihood-free inference framework for population genomic analysis by applying a highly active area of machine learning research called deep learning. We will apply the method to various parameter estimation and classification problems in population genomics, particularly joint inference of selection and demography. In addition to carrying out technical research, we will develop a useful software package that will allow researchers from the population genomics community to utilize deep learning in their own research. It is becoming increasingly more popular to utilize time-series genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale to infer allele frequency changes over a time course. This development creates new opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to estimate their associated fitness parameters. In Aim 3, we will develop new statistical methods to take full advantage of this novel data source at both short and long evolutionary timescales. Specifically, we will develop and apply efficient statistical inference methods for analyzing time-series genomic variation data from experimental evolution and ancient DNA samples. Useful open-source software will be developed for each specific aim. The novel methods developed in this project will help to analyze and interpret genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     This project will develop several novel statistical methods for analyzing and interpreting human genetic variation data at the whole-genome scale.

DNA methylation is altered in cancer, and DNA methylation-induced silencing of promoters of tumor-suppressors is thought to play a key role in tumorigenesis. Though there is an increasing number of methylation sequencing datasets generated from cancer, they are confounded by tumor heterogeneity. Understanding the subclonal architecture underlying heterogeneity is important because individual cancer subclones impact cancer growth, treatment resistance, and metastasis. Increased “epigenetic heterogeneity,” or variation in DNA methylation patterns, was determined to be correlated with worse prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these studies only profiled epigenetic heterogeneity at a global scale and did not analyze methylation of individual subclones. Many computational methods have been developed for this purpose in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), but these methods are not applicable for methylation sequencing data. As such, there is a need to develop new computational methods to study subclonal methylation profiles in cancer. I will develop a novel computational method (DXM) that deconvolves DNA methylation of heterogeneous clinical samples into their major subpopulations, their prevalence, and their respective DNA methylation profiles (Aim 1). DXM will be developed on simulations generated from data available from both the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and the Blueprint Epigenome Project and will be validated with methylation sequencing on DLBCL samples. I will then leverage DXM to study subclonal methylation profiles in AML (Aim 2). I hypothesize that methylation can confer fitness advantages in epigenetic subclones of AML, leading to clonal expansion following therapeutic intervention and subsequent relapse. Using DXM, I will first identify epigenetic subclones from whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from AML patients with well-characterized genetic subclonal architecture and compare the epigenetic subclonal architecture to that of the genetic subclones. In a second dataset containing methylation sequencing data from paired diagnosis-relapse samples, I will apply DXM, identify subclonal methylation profiles, and characterize all genes impacted by subclonal methylation to determine if they are expected to confer fitness advantages. Finally, I will test if mutations known to impact DNA methylation in AML (DNMT3A, IDH1/2) alter epigenetic subclonal expansion. Taken together, this proposal will result in a new computational approach to interpret epigenetic data from heterogeneous clinical samples as well as identification of DNA methylation changes in epigenetic subclones of AML that contribute to disease progression and correlate with prognosis. Project Narrative Studies that characterize which variations in cancer relate to worse outcome may do analysis on the entire tumor sample, which is composed of many different types of cells, each with distinct biology. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel computational method to analyze variations in cancer at the level of cell-types. These results can be used to improve patient prognostics and care in multiple cancers.",Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias,9611428,F30CA224687,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Acute Myelocytic Leukemia ', ' acute myeloid leukemia ', ' acute granulocytic leukemia ', ' Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ', ' Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia ', ' AML - Acute Myeloid Leukemia ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastasis ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Relapse ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Tumor Promoters ', ' United States ', ' X Inactivation ', ' X-Chromosome Inactivation ', ' Lyonization ', ' CpG dinucleotide ', ' cytosine-guanine dinucleotide ', "" cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine "", ' cytidine monophosphate guanosine ', ' CG-dinucleotide ', "" 3'-5'-CpG "", ' bisulfite ', ' hydrosulfite ', ' hydrogen sulfite ', ' Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting ', ' Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sortings ', ' Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting Fractionation ', ' Tumor Suppressor Genes ', ' oncosuppressor gene ', ' Tumor Suppressing Genes ', ' Recessive Oncogenes ', ' Oncogenes-Tumor Suppressors ', ' Onco-Suppressor Genes ', ' Emerogenes ', ' Cancer Suppressor Genes ', ' Antioncogenes ', ' Anti-Oncogenes ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Parental Imprinting ', ' Genetic Imprinting ', ' Genomic Imprinting ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Genetic ', "" large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma "", ' Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma ', ' DLBCL ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Tumor Suppressor Proteins ', ' tumor suppressor ', ' Retrotransposon ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Sampling ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clonal Expansion ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' therapy resistant ', ' epigenomics ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' lymphoma/leukemia ', ' leukemia/lymphoma ', ' Prevalence ', ' human disease ', ' tumor ', ' clinical care ', ' epigenome ', ' methylation pattern ', ' single cell sequencing ', ' bisulfite-seq ', ' Bisulfite-based sequencing ', ' BS-seq ', ' bisulfite sequencing ', ' epigenome wide association analysis ', ' EWAS ', ' epigenome-wide association studies ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' intratumor heterogeneity ', ' intra-tumoral heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneity in tumors ', ' Intratumoral heterogeneity ', ' tumor heterogeneity ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' whole genome ', ' ']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,30434,0.09241294427356919
"DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Project Summary: DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Pituitary Adenomas (PAs) are among the most common intracranial tumors, and may cause hypopituitarism, neurological deficits, and lethal hormonal oversecretion disorders such as Cushing's disease and acromegaly. Although typically benign, PA invasion into surrounding dura, bone, and brain is evident in nearly half of symptomatic patients and is the major barrier to achieving long-term tumor control, hormonal remission, and normalized patient survival. Genetic mutations do not play a major role in the development or behavior of non-familial PAs, and a major knowledge gap exists in understanding the molecular underpinnings of PA hormonal function and invasive growth. Alternatively, epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) and gene expression alterations are known to influence PA phenotype, but these effects vary with gene location and context. Our team performed the first epigenome-wide pilot study to explore the association of DNA methylation and gene expression with PA behavior, and validated several genes implicated in PA hormonal function and invasion. Using a similar workflow, our overall goal is to define the role that DNA methylation and gene expression play in PA hormonal secretion and invasion in a larger study stratified according to PA hormonal subtype and invasion status. We hypothesize that: 1) variation in DNA methylation and expression is associated with subtype-specific PA hormonal function and invasion; 2) DNA methylation and expression data can be used to identify novel molecularly-defined PA classes and complement current PA diagnostic schemes; and 3) modulated expression of prioritized genes of interest will affect PA hormonal secretion and invasion in vitro. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) use integrative epigenomic profiling and RNA sequencing approaches to analyze surgically-resected invasive and noninvasive PAs derived from a multi-institutional consortium, 2) discover novel molecularly-defined PA subtypes using DNA methylation and gene expression analysis, followed by development of a molecularly-based classification and unified diagnostic scheme, 3) identify candidate DNA methylation and gene expression markers associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion, 4) use established rat and surgically-resected human PA primary cell lines to test hormonal secretion and invasion phenotypes following modulation of expression of prioritized genes. Understanding the molecular pathways associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion will provide practitioners with more precise diagnostic information and help to develop targeted drug therapies to curb or reverse PA hormonal oversecretion and invasion, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this study could help refractory PA patients by helping to mitigate lifelong risks associated with chronic hormone oversecretion, medications, radiation treatment, and repeat surgery. Project Narrative Pituitary adenomas (PAs) may cause significant disability or death due to hormonal oversecretion and neurological deterioration caused by invasive tumor growth. PA hormonal secretion and invasive growth are explained in part by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) affecting gene expression, rather than gene mutations. Our study will compare epigenetic and gene expression signatures in invasive versus noninvasive PAs of various hormonal subtypes, thereby providing key insights into gene pathways and mechanisms associated with PA behavior, aiding in the diagnosis and molecular classification of PAs, and helping to guide development of precision drugs to curb or arrest hormonal secretion and invasive growth

"Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML  PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the bone marrow, where immature cells accumulate and disrupt the production of normal blood cells, disrupting normal blood formation and organ function. Despite advances in research, AML patients are typically treated with chemotherapy agents that often fail to cure them and frequently lead to relapse. We propose to create new therapies for repressing AML based on targeting the epigenome, or the pattern of chemical modification of DNA and histones, the proteins that package and order DNA to promote gene expression.",Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML,9681931,F31CA228331,[''],NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,F31,2018,49524,0.038064943230137226
"Spatial Epigenomic Profiling of Immune Cell Signatures at Subcellular Resolution in Health and Disease SPATIAL EPIGENOMIC PROFILING OF IMMUNE CELL SIGNATURES AT SUBCELLULAR  RESOLUTION IN HEALTH AND DISEASE More than ten percent of childhood cancers are still incurable and need novel therapies. Epigenetic treatments deserve special attention with their specificity and reduced toxicity. Here I plan to explore epigenetic profiles of immune and cancer cells in normal development and blood cancer patients under the mentorship of Garry Nolan for single cell proteomics technology development, in collaboration with Howard Chang for implementation of epigenomic methods such as chromosome accessibility assays, and with Kara Davis for epigenetics studies of treatment resistant B cell subtypes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Epigenetic measurements have been limited to bulk level sequencing and ligation assays or limited number of imaging markers. To address these limitations, I will use an emerging three dimensional (3D) proteomic imaging technology in individual cells, termed as 3D Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) or 3D MIBI. Epigenetics research by 3D MIBI benefits from high degree multiplexing (up to 100 markers) and super resolution imaging capability (20 nm x-y; 5 nm z resolution), providing exciting opportunities to study genomic sites, methylated DNA, protein factors, and chromosome accessibility, all within the same experiments in single immune and aberrant (leukemic) cells. To systematically determine epigenetic states, I plan to utilize clonal B cell lines to decipher variability of epigenetic components including chromatin states, protein factors and modifiers by a fifty-marker 3D MIBI panel (Aim 1). These experiments will show distribution of epigenetic factors (linear or log-scale) in their expression levels and spatial variations (global or local) in the chromatin states. I will then perform experiments with primary B cells isolated from six different bone marrow aspirates of normal human subjects (Aim 2). I will correlate epigenetic signatures of each B cell subtype to corresponding development state (progenitor, pre, post, or mature). I will then perform an ex vivo co-culture of primary B cells on OP9 stromal cells over 1-6 weeks of culturing, which will be followed by fixation and profiling by 3D MIBI. These perturbation experiments will show how signaling events from neighboring cells drive necessary epigenetic conditions that are required for reaching a B cell subset. Finally, I will turn to primary B cells that are isolated from twenty newly diagnosed ALL patients (Aim 3). I will dissect differentiation and spatial epigenomic remodeling of responder B cell subsets and treatment resistant B cell subtypes from bone marrow aspirates using the OP9 co-culture. These will show how treatment resistance arises from a single epigenetic state or multiple distinct epigenetic signatures. I will then screen Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) on the same co-culture of B cell subtypes from ALL and stromal cells. By varying concentration and duration of inhibition conditions, I will dissect the role of epigenetic drugs in spatial chromatin remodeling toward development of epigenetic therapies in ALL. Together, these experiments will shed light on the role of epigenetic programming for cancer treatment applications from immune cell signatures in normal subjects and blood cancer patients. Public Health Relevance: Epigenetic alterations in immune and cancer cells regulate normal development and aberrant formation in humans.

"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes.

"Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D Project Summary Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team. Project Narrative This project develops advanced computational methods for integrating information on the 3D structure of the human genome with large-scale genomics data sets generated by the ENCODE project to gain insight into cell-type specific chromatin state and gene regulation. These studies have broad relevance for understanding the regulation of gene expression in human cells and the disruption of gene expression programs in disease.","Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D",9420631,U01HG009395,"['learning strategy ', ' chromosome capture ', ' chromatin conformation capture ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' Chromosome Interaction Analysis with Paired-End Tags ', ' ChIA-PET ', ' Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing ', ' genomic data ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' deep learning ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Atlases ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Elements ', ' Encyclopedias ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Ploidies ', ' chromosome complement ', ' DNA Ploidy ', ' DNA Index ', ' DNA Content ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Peptide Signal Sequences ', ' protein signal sequence ', ' Signal Sequences ', ' Signal Peptide ', ' Specificity ', ' Supervision ', ' Technology ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Guide RNA ', ' gRNA ', ' Enhancers ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' DNA Loop ', ' Chromatin Loop Domains ', ' Chromatin Loop ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Output ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' 3D modeling ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' next generation ', ' 3D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' transcriptomics ', ' sequence learning ', ' genome annotation ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' CRISPR ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' DNaseI-seq ', ' DNase-seq ', ' DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing ', ' ATACseq ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' genomic editing ', ' genome editing ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' ']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2018,717318,0.03563856320824353
"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"Joint patterns of multi-genetic/epigenetic factors via non-parametric clustering and their association with allergic disease Ray PA-16-162 Project Summary Eczema is a chronic skin inflammatory disease infecting 10-30% of children and 2-10% of adults and increasing. Researchers have struggled to understand the genetic and environmental factors that appear to play a role in eczema's increasing prevalence. The majority of current studies focus on one or two specific types of Genome-wide data in association with eczema such as SNPS, DNA methylation levels, or gene expression levels. Current statistical methods have forced this limitation as none exist, to our knowledge that allow clustering of subjects across multi-dimensional and multi-faceted variables. Therefore, in this project we aim to introduce a novel clustering approach that will cluster subjects across genes which contain SNP information, DNA methylation levels, and gene expression levels. Summarized clusters will then tested for associated risk of eczema or any allergic disease. Genetic patterns associated with eczema will then be further explored to better identify the behavior genetic data and it's uniqueness. The method will be built in R Gui as a free downloadable package making it accessible and easy to use. We will apply the proposed method to the third generation Isle of Wight cohort data. The third generation cohort data consist of children born (2010-current time) from the original cohort of children born between 1989 and 1990 on the Isle of Wight in the UK and contains Genome-wide datasets, disease and exposure status, and allergy information across multiple follow-ups. The implications of this study not only impact the statistical field with a new clustering approach but the eczema and allergy field as well as no other studies have been able to analyze three Genome-wide datasets in concert associated with the risk of allergic diseases.

"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns. Allelic dosage and random forest selection frequency (RFSF) analyses will be used to identify novel methylation quantitative trait loci within SS-associated genes in cases and controls (separately), and we will test whether cell-proportion or eQTLs can explain SS-specific methylation patterns. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic, highly heterogenous, multisystem autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women. This disease is known to be associated with epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, an axis of epigenetic variation that has been implicated as a mediator of disease risk in other autoimmune diseases. Full characterization of DNA methylation patterns across different cell types and affected tissues will provide new insights into disease etiology, phenotype classification, and targets for future therapeutic strategies.",Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome,9458167,F31DE025176,"['rheumatic arthritis ', ' Atrophic Arthritis ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' B-Lymphocytes ', ' Bursa-Equivalent Lymphocyte ', ' Bursa-Dependent Lymphocytes ', ' B-cell ', ' B-Cells ', ' B cells ', ' B cell ', ' B blood cells ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biopsy ', ' Carbon ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cytosine ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fellowship ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Code ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE -

"Inferring gene regulatory circuitry from functional genomics data PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been known that methylation of genomic DNA correlates with gene expression. However, the structural mechanisms that underlie these observations remain obscure. In this project, we will pursue several innovative strategies for studying how methylation affects transcription factor (TF) binding. First, we will use Methyl-SELEX-seq – a novel experimental method developed in the previous cycle of this grant that uses barcoded mixtures of methylated and unmethylated DNA ligands – to create detailed maps of the effect of methylation on binding affinity for a broad panel of human transcription factors from various structural families. Second, we will perform detailed computational analyses and follow-up experiments to test the hypothesis that methylation causes local changes in DNA shape, which in turn modify TF binding affinity. We have shown that adding a methyl group in the major groove changes the geometry of the minor groove and enhances the electrostatic interaction between negative charges in the DNA minor groove and positively charged amino- acids in the TF. We will extend these analyses to other DNA modifications, as well as a wider range of DNA shape parameters and associated flexibility parameters. By building interpretable TF-DNA recognition models that integrate base, shape, and flexibility features using a powerful new machine learning framework developed in the previous funding cycle, we will make specific predictions regarding sequence and methylation readout mechanisms, and validate these using SELEX experiments with mutated TFs. To assess to what extent our quantitative models for binding to naked DNA built from SELEX data are predictive of binding to genomic DNA in the context of the living cell, we will perform detailed parallel analyses of SELEX and ChIP- seq data for Hox proteins and other TFs. Finally, to study the relationship between DNA binding and gene expression control in human cell lines, we will exploit Survey of Regulatory Elements (SuRE-seq), a novel massively parallel reporter assay that provides unique information about the autonomous transcriptional activity for each of >108 overlapping genomic fragments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epigenetic modifications of the human genome are known to play a key role in development and disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. The main goal of this proposal is to develop and apply new experimental and computational tools for analyzing how the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA is influenced by cytosine methylation.

"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The experimental approach to test the above hypothesis consists of the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the developmental and generational aspects of the genome-wide germline epimutations. Aim 2) Determine the genomic features associated with the epimutations and potential genetic alterations involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. Aim 3) Determine the optimal exposure parameters of the environmental induced transgenerational model and correlate epigenetic biomarkers with exposure and disease. Completion of the proposed research will determine the cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The proposed research will further elucidate the molecular and developmental aspects of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral exposure and disease.

"Toward Diagnostics and Therapies of Molecular Subcategories of CAD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and in the US. While the genetics of this disease are intrinsically complex, thanks to huge research investments during the last 5-10 years, particularly in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a more unbiased, data-driven and realistic view of CAD has been achieved. As part of this achievement, ~160 common risk loci for CAD/myocardial infarction (MI) have been identified. An important task is now to understand the molecular mechanisms/pathways by which these loci exert risk for CAD/MI allowing to translating the initial findings into new therapies and diagnostics. However, since the loci identified thus far explain only ~10% of variation in CAD/MI risk, it is also essential to define additional CAD pathways operating in parallel with GWA loci. In recent years, clinical studies that consider intermediate phenotypes (between DNA and disease) have greatly enhanced interpretations of risk loci identified in GWA datasets. In addition, disease networks that can be identified from intermediate molecular phenotypes provide an essential framework to identify novel CAD pathways and targets for new CAD therapies. Over the last 6 years, we have performed a clinical study considering many intermediate phenotypes in CAD patients (the STARNET study). In this proposal we intend to use newly generated DNA genotype and RNA sequence data from the STARNET study to identify atherosclerosis and metabolic networks underlying CAD. We then propose a new prospective study of CAD (the NGS-PREDICT study) with the main purpose of validating findings from the STARNET study. We hypothesize that the extent and stability of coronary lesions, thus clinical outcomes can be accurately assessed by defining the status of key atherosclerosis gene networks. In turn, metabolic networks active in liver, abdominal fat, and skeletal muscle influence the status of the atherosclerosis gene networks. In addition, molecular data isolated from easily obtainable tissues (e.g., blood, subcutaneous fat and plasma) can be used to identify biomarkers that can predict risk for clinical events caused by CAD. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: To identify regulatory Bayesian gene networks causally linked to CAD and/or CAD sub-phenotypes using the STARNET datasets and the CARDIoGRAM meta-analysis GWA datasets. Aim 2: Identify biomarkers predicting clinical events of CAD (reflected in SYNTAX score) by applying machine learning on DNA genotype, RNA sequence and CAD plasma protein data from easily obtainable tissues of the STARNET cases. Aim 3: To validate the identified causal CAD eQTLs/networks and the biomarkers using the NGS-PREDICT study performed at the Mt. Sinai Hospital, the Swedish Twin study and CAD cell and animal models. We believe the proposed studies can lead to a significantly better molecular understanding of CAD and thus, serve the more long-term goal of preventive and personalized therapies of CAD patients diagnosed in well-defined molecular subcategories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the world's leading cause of death. We will perform systems genetic analysis of DNA and RNAseq data from 9 CAD-relevant tissues in 700 well-characterized patients (STARNET) integrated with genome-wide association data to reveal CAD-causing metabolic and atherosclerosis gene networks, and within these, new inherited risk variants, CAD-mechanisms, therapeutic targets and biomarkers will be identified and validated in a new prospective clinical study of CAD (NGS-PREDICT).

"Cell line identification with DNA replication timing fingerprints Project Summary Cultured cell lines have been widely used for basic research to study cell function, as models for disease, and for drug screening. Correct identification of the cell lines used is necessary to make the right scientific conclusions and replicate experiments. Cell lines in culture can be contaminated by foreign cells, which may rapidly displace the original cells. The routine verification of the identity of cultured cells should be performed, but a majority of laboratories do not monitor the identity of their cell lines, and many cell lines are misidentified. Analyses of cells submitted to major repositories such as the DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen) and the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) have found that 15-40% of cell lines submitted by investigators are misidentified. The costs, effort, and time required to confirm the identity of cell lines have been a barrier to adoption of cell line identification as a routine quality control measure. Current technologies for identifying cultured cells are limited, and their cost is a barrier for small scale use. In this SBIR phase I application, we aim to develop a novel tool for cell line and cell type identification using DNA replication timing (RT) fingerprints, which are RT values at specific genomic regions. In our previous studies, we have discovered that DNA RT was highly specific to different cell lines and cell types and this specificity can be exploited for the purpose of cell line/type identification (PLoS Comp Biol, 2011; Genome Research, 2010; Genome Research 2015). A patent for RT fingerprint identification and use has been issued in 2016. Recently, we have applied this technology to identify common markers between distinct progeroid diseases (PNAS, 2017). A novel segmentation method, called iSeg, for segmenting genomic and epigenomic data has also been developed in our lab (BMC Bioinformatics, In Press), which can be used to further improve the identification of RT fingerprints. We propose to collect a large number of DNA RT profiles for a diverse set of cell lines and cell types and develop RT fingerprints for their identification. A web server will be built to take users’ input of RT data and output the cell line best matched with the input data. The web server can also take data of new cell lines from users to allow continually developing our models and database. RT fingerprints can be measured cost-effectively using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiment. Since the total cost for obtaining RT fingerprint for one sample is around $100, which can be further reduced when scaled up, our method makes it possible to routinely check the identity of cultured cells.

"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9766330,R01HG009188,"['Affect ', ' Carbon ', ' Charge ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' DNA-Dependent DNA Polymerases ', ' DNA Polymerases ', ' DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase ', ' Single-Stranded DNA ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' Hybrids ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Motion ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Noise ', ' Nucleotides ', ' optical ', ' Optics ', ' protein design ', ' genetic protein engineering ', ' Protein Engineering ', ' Proteins ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Transistors ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biochemical ', ' Individual ', ' enzyme activity ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Route ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Performance ', ' solid state ', ' molecular modeling ', ' Molecular Models ', ' Molecular Modeling Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Molecular Modeling Nucleic Acid Biochemistry ', ' Base Pairing ', ' novel ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Modality ', ' Devices ', ' response ', ' Nanotechnology ', ' nanotechnological ', ' nanotech ', ' nano-technological ', ' nano technology ', ' nano tech ', ' single molecule ', ' Polymerase ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Enzyme Kinetics ', ' Monitor ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' nanoelectronics ', ' nano electronics ', ' nanoscale ', ' nanometer sized ', ' nanometer scale ', ' nano scale ', ' nano meter sized ', ' nano meter scale ', ' nanopore ', ' nano pore ', ' single walled carbon nanotube ', ' single walled carbon nano tube ', ' SWNT ', ' scale up ', ' Massive Parallel Sequencing ', ' Massively Parallel Sequencing ', ' Massively Parallel DNA Sequencing ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNAseq ', ' DNA seq ', ' competitive environment ', ' competitive atmosphere ', ' ']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2019,468098,0.09980744328761414
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9653114,R01DC011805,"['Affect ', ' Botulinum Toxins ', ' Clostridium botulinum Toxins ', ' Botulin ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communication ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Muscle Dystonia ', ' Dystonia ', ' Exhibits ', ' Genes ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' larynx muscle ', ' Laryngeal Muscles ', ' Laryngeal muscle structure ', ' voice box ', ' Larynx Head and Neck ', ' Laryngeal ', ' Larynx ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Social isolation ', ' Muscular Spasm ', ' Muscle Spasm ', ' Spasm ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Voice ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Family history of ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Spastic Dysphonias ', ' spasmodic dysphonia ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Oral ', ' Parietal ', ' Occupational ', ' Penetrance ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Focal Dystonias ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' symptom improvement ', ' improve symptom ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' exome sequencing ', ' exome-seq ', ' screening ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Genetic study ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging marker ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' imaging genetics ', ' translational impact ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNAseq ', ' DNA seq ', ' Injections ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2019,696730,-0.05401233736733895
"Novel Statistical methods for DNA Sequencing Data, and applications to Autism. Summary One of the major problems in human genetics is understanding the genetic causes underlying complex phenotypes, including neuropsychiatric traits such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. Despite tremendous work over the past few decades, the underlying biological mechanisms are poorly understood in most cases. Recent advances in high-throughput, massively parallel genomic technologies have revolutionized the field of human genetics and promise to lead to important scientific advances. Despite this progress in data generation, it remains very challenging to analyze and interpret these data. The main focus of this proposal is the development of powerful statistical methods for the integration of whole-genome sequencing data with rich functional genomics data with the goal to improve the discovery of genes involved in autism spectrum disorders. We propose to integrate data from many different sources, including epigenetic data from projects such as ENCODE, Roadmap, and PsychENCODE, eQTL data from the GTEx, PsychENCODE and CommonMind consortia, data from large scale databases of genetic variation such as ExAC and gnomAD, in order to predict functional effects of genetic variants in non-coding genetic regions in a tissue and cell type specific manner, and generate functional maps across large number of tissues and cell types in the human body that we can then use to identify novel associations with autism in whole-genome sequencing studies. The proposed functional predictions and functional maps will be broadly available in the popular ANNOVAR database. We further propose to use these functional predictions in the analysis of almost 20,000 whole genomes from three large whole genome sequencing studies for autism. We believe that the proposed research is very timely and has the potential to substantially improve the analysis of non-coding genetic variation, and hence provide new insights into the biological mechanisms underlying risk to autism, and more broadly to other neuropsychiatric diseases. Narrative Autism Spectrum Disorders are common diseases with major impact on public health. Although coding variation has been extensively studied for its role in affecting risk to autism, the analysis of non-coding variation poses tremendous challenges. The proposed statistical methods and their applications to nearly 20,000 whole genomes from three large autism whole genome sequencing studies will improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in autism with important implications for disease treatment strategies.","Novel Statistical methods for DNA Sequencing Data, and applications to Autism.",9735436,R01MH095797,"['Affect ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Chromatin ', ' computing method ', ' computer methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computational methods ', ' computational methodology ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' frontal cortex ', ' frontal lobe ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Code ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human Genetics ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Human body ', ' Human Figure ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' functional genomics ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Brain region ', ' genome sequencing ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' autistic spectrum disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Autism ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' epigenomics ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' large-scale database ', ' large-scale data base ', ' gene discovery ', ' discover genes ', ' treatment strategy ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' GTEx ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNAseq ', ' DNA seq ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,454366,-0.010874141089534422
"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Project Summary: DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Pituitary Adenomas (PAs) are among the most common intracranial tumors, and may cause hypopituitarism, neurological deficits, and lethal hormonal oversecretion disorders such as Cushing's disease and acromegaly. Although typically benign, PA invasion into surrounding dura, bone, and brain is evident in nearly half of symptomatic patients and is the major barrier to achieving long-term tumor control, hormonal remission, and normalized patient survival. Genetic mutations do not play a major role in the development or behavior of non-familial PAs, and a major knowledge gap exists in understanding the molecular underpinnings of PA hormonal function and invasive growth. Alternatively, epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) and gene expression alterations are known to influence PA phenotype, but these effects vary with gene location and context. Our team performed the first epigenome-wide pilot study to explore the association of DNA methylation and gene expression with PA behavior, and validated several genes implicated in PA hormonal function and invasion. Using a similar workflow, our overall goal is to define the role that DNA methylation and gene expression play in PA hormonal secretion and invasion in a larger study stratified according to PA hormonal subtype and invasion status. We hypothesize that: 1) variation in DNA methylation and expression is associated with subtype-specific PA hormonal function and invasion; 2) DNA methylation and expression data can be used to identify novel molecularly-defined PA classes and complement current PA diagnostic schemes; and 3) modulated expression of prioritized genes of interest will affect PA hormonal secretion and invasion in vitro. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) use integrative epigenomic profiling and RNA sequencing approaches to analyze surgically-resected invasive and noninvasive PAs derived from a multi-institutional consortium, 2) discover novel molecularly-defined PA subtypes using DNA methylation and gene expression analysis, followed by development of a molecularly-based classification and unified diagnostic scheme, 3) identify candidate DNA methylation and gene expression markers associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion, 4) use established rat and surgically-resected human PA primary cell lines to test hormonal secretion and invasion phenotypes following modulation of expression of prioritized genes. Understanding the molecular pathways associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion will provide practitioners with more precise diagnostic information and help to develop targeted drug therapies to curb or reverse PA hormonal oversecretion and invasion, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this study could help refractory PA patients by helping to mitigate lifelong risks associated with chronic hormone oversecretion, medications, radiation treatment, and repeat surgery. Project Narrative Pituitary adenomas (PAs) may cause significant disability or death due to hormonal oversecretion and neurological deterioration caused by invasive tumor growth. PA hormonal secretion and invasive growth are explained in part by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) affecting gene expression, rather than gene mutations. Our study will compare epigenetic and gene expression signatures in invasive versus noninvasive PAs of various hormonal subtypes, thereby providing key insights into gene pathways and mechanisms associated with PA behavior, aiding in the diagnosis and molecular classification of PAs, and helping to guide development of precision drugs to curb or arrest hormonal secretion and invasive growth

"Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer ABSTRACT There is an unmet need for novel approaches to cancer research, including improved model systems. Pet dogs are among the most promising natural models for translational cancer research​. They share our environment and develop cancers with clear clinical, histological, and genomic similarities to human cancer. We propose to use new genomic technology and a direct-to-dog-owner approach to overcome existing limitations of the canine model. To accomplish this, we will use new liquid biopsy technology, which makes it possible to sequence ​tumor exomes in circulating cell-free DNA from a blood sample, and thus achieve deeper understanding of tumor genomics without invasive biopsies. The power of these minimally invasive sampling technologies is greatest in application to very large sets of clinical samples. Family dogs, whose environments are shared with humans and for which tumor genomics are similar to human cancers, offer an unparalleled model in which to assemble clinical sets of size sufficient both to confirm the relevance of known genetic pathways, and to identify new ones. We propose to combine the power of cell-free DNA sequencing, ​the enthusiasm of citizen-scientist pet owners, and the clinical experience of veterinarians. We will create a research portal for collection of information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcome for thousands of dogs with cancer, as well as their environment and lifestyle. W​e will also develop new computational methodologies to identify genomic similarities between canine and human cancers. Comparison of these canine and human mutational profiles will enable matching of canine cancer subtypes with human cancer subtypes based on genetic pathways, facilitating canine trials to advance human clinical studies. We aim to:  Aim 1. ​Develop software to Identify canine models for human cancers using genomic data and  comprehensive, histology-blind analysis approach.  Aim 2. Develop and optimize ​cell-free DNA sampling and sequencing methods in dogs, including  ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing.  Aim 3. Implement a ​direct-to-dog-owner smartphone app to collect and validate detailed clinical, and  environmental data, paired with blood samples, for thousands of dogs. By combining the power of genome sequencing and new liquid biopsy technology with the opportunity to collect large sets of samples from a species whose cancers are genomically reflective of those in humans, our project​ will​ transform​ the scale and scope of translational cancer research and precision medicine. Project Narrative Pet dogs live in the same environments that we do, suggesting that profiling mutations in dog tumors could guide treatment of human cancers. With the help of veterinarians and citizen-scientist dog owners, we will build tools and resources needed to study cancer in thousands of dogs at once.

"Molecular images and machine learning to extract placental function from maternal cfDNA Abstract  Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state. cfDNA is fragmented with sizes centered around 145bp and 166bp which is approximately the length of DNA wrapped around a nucleosome, and a nucleosome plus its linker, respectively. Shorter fragments (30-100bp) also exist and have a clear periodicity of 10bp, corresponding to a turn of the DNA helix wrapped around the core histone. Recent reports have shown that the fragmentation sizes of cfDNA are tissue specific, which is a product of distinct nucleosome spacing that is inherent in the function of individual tissues. When these individual fragments are compared with existing epigenetic data from tissues, they can be binned into cell of origin simply based on whether they reveal the nucleosome positioning information of the originating tissue. Identifying cfDNA fragments of placental origin from maternal circulation would provide a non-invasive means of assessing placental function during human pregnancy.  Several major barriers inhibit cfDNA as a non-invasive method for examining placental function: 1) the ability to accurately identify the placental origin of the short <160bp cfDNA fragments that constitute regulatory information (paternal SNPs occur at frequency of approximately 1/2000bp). 2) the ability to use these fragments to piece together precise epigenetic states of the placenta. 3) the cost of deep whole genome sequencing that has traditionally been required to deconvolute epigenetic profiles of admixed cellular origins. Our goal is to overcome each of these barriers by exploiting state-of-the-art genomics and machine learning techniques to extract precise information about human placental function from cfDNA. We will first compile robust and accurate nucleosome information, including epigenetic and transcription factor occupancy, from the human placenta and then we will establish machine-learning platforms to elucidate placental cfDNA from maternal circulation at low cost. Success in this project will enable earlier intervention for high-risk pregnancies and facilitate the longitudinal, non-invasive real-time monitoring of pregnancy progression, thereby informing adaptive treatment decision-making.

"Rapid and broad pathogen profiling system for infection in newborn Abstract Worldwide, infectious disease remains the leading cause of neonatal mortality and results in one million newborn deaths each year. Rapid and precise profiling of pathogens is the key to targeted and effective clinical management of infectious disease. However, current diagnostic methods are slow, limited in breadth of detection, and often unreliable. Further, they have limited ability to detect polymicrobial infection and suffer from poor specificity due to an inability to distinguish clinically relevant from non-pathogenic DNA. Genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (HRM) provides a simple, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. HRM generates sequence specific melt curves in a closed-tube reaction as PCR-amplified DNA fragments are heated and disassociate. Our team has advanced this technology through the proof-of-concept stage, demonstrating that a novel digital PCR format for HRM can achieve accurate universal genotyping and quantification of DNA targets in under 3 hours. DNA sequences present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified using the principles of microfluidic sample partitioning and machine learning to enable sensitive specific polymicrobial detection of all the targets present in the DNA mixture. However, for clinical integration, critical innovations are needed. This includes optimization of our upstream processing steps to selectively capture, load, and detect DNA sequences from only viable pathogen cells from a small-volume (≤ 1mL) neonatal blood sample. Further, methods to establish linkages between pathogen identity and antibiotic resistance are needed at the single cell level to fully characterize and accurately quantitate the resistance profile of the pathogen population for precise targeted treatment. In phase I of this proposal, we will focus on refining sample preparation steps to (1) maximize our sensitivity and (2) enable co-localization of resistance markers with identified microbes. We hypothesize that we can efficiently capture pathogen load from blood, reducing interference from human cell contents and enable single cell analysis and quantitation of only viable pathogens while linking species identification and resistance. The processes and tests developed in this proposal will provide: 1) high negative predictive value to rule out bloodstream infection; and 2) specific identification and quantitation of pathogens along with co-localization of relevant antibiotic resistance genes for the targeted treatment of true infections while limiting influence from contaminants or environmental microbes of no clinical significance. In Phase II, the system will be developed to its beta form for testing in a clinical environment. Melio’s goal is to ultimately deliver a low-cost, small-footprint benchtop device compatible with the clinical workflow. Narrative We propose the development of a culture-independent molecular diagnostic test that will enable the rapid and precise detection of infections in newborns. This test uniquely combines the cutting-edge technologies of machine learning, microfluidic partitioning of samples for digital interrogation, and High-Resolution Melting of nucleic acids to create unique pathogen fingerprints for all high-risk bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens and associated resistance marker(s) present in small-volume blood samples in under 3 hours. Such a timely and accurate test is needed for effective antimicrobial therapy in newborns suspected of infection to reduce antibiotic use in non-infected patients while aggressively treating those in need with narrow spectrum antibiotics targeted towards the offending pathogens.",Rapid and broad pathogen profiling system for infection in newborn,9778646,R43AI145567,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibiotics ', ' Miscellaneous Antibiotic ', ' Antibiotic Drugs ', ' Antibiotic Agents ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood Volume ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chemistry ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Conserved Sequence ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' resistant to Drug ', ' resistance to Drug ', ' drug resistant ', ' Drug resistance ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Fingerprint ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' newborn children ', ' newborn child ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' Infection ', ' instrumentation ', ' neonatal ICU ', ' Newborn Intensive Care Units ', ' Neonatal Intensive Care Units ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' newborn mortality ', ' newborn death ', ' neonatal mortalities ', ' Neonatal Mortality ', ' Noise ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Patients ', ' Running ', ' Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Custom ', ' Tube ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Asses ', ' Equus asinus ', ' Donkey ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Whole Blood ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' neonatal sepsis ', ' Respiratory distress ', ' single cell analysis ', ' microbial ', ' melting ', ' novel ', ' DNA amplification ', ' Devices ', ' Molecular Diagnostic Testing ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Lysis ', ' Cytolysis ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Symptoms ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' resistance mechanism ', ' resistant mechanism ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Neurodevelopmental Disorder ', ' Neurological Development Disorder ', ' neonate ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Sepsis ', ' bloodstream infection ', ' blood infection ', ' Outcome ', ' Resistance profile ', ' Resistant profile ', ' Neonatal ', ' pathogen ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' antimicrobial ', ' anti-microbial ', ' Microbe ', ' Pathogen detection ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' plasmid DNA ', ' high risk ', ' Genomic DNA ', ' gDNA ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' pathogen genome ', ' pathogenome ', ' whole genome ', ' full genome ', ' entire genome ', ' microbiome research ', ' microbiome studies ', ' microbiome science ', ' Microbiomics ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' pathogenic fungus ', ' fungal pathogen ', ' pathogenic virus ', ' viral pathogen ', ' pathogen genomics ', ' ']",NIAID,MELIOLABS INC.,R43,2019,280125,0.021719590126849594
"HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF MAMMALIAN ACTIVATION DOMAINS Project Summary Abstract Transcription factors (TFs) control gene expression by binding to DNA and either activating or repressing target gene expression. While our understanding of how TFs bind DNA has grown rapidly, our understanding of how TFs activate transcription once they are bound has not kept pace. As a result, when we identify a mutation in a patient in a TF, if this mutation is in the DNA binding domain, we can sometimes predict if it will disrupt function; if the mutation is in the activation domain, we have no ability to predict its effects. To address this gap, I propose to study the amino acid composition of acidic activation domains using high-throughput assays and modern computational analyses. I have recently developed a high-throughput assay for measuring thousands of designed activation domain mutants in yeast. Here, I propose to develop a similar method in mammalian cell culture. In Aim 1, I propose an in-depth study of a few activation domains as a model for how genetic variation impacts TF function. In Aim 2, I propose a broad survey of human transcription factors to search for new activation domains. In the independent phase of this grant (R00), I propose 2 more aims to investigate the mechanisms how TFs activate target genes. In Aim 3, I will functional classify different type of activation domains and search for common features of each time. In Aim 4, I will link activation domains to cofactors and look for the features that predict activation.] This proposal will create a new layer of annotation for the human genome: all regions that are sufficient to serve as activation domains, create a new genome-scale method and deliver computational models for predicting activation domains from amino acid sequence. This award will support training in mammalian experimental systems and advanced machine learning analysis. Together these aims will support the long term goal of reading the regulatory genome by predicting gene expression from DNA sequence. Project Narrative Transcription factors are proteins that bind DNA and turn target genes ON or OFF. When we sequence a genome, we can identify which proteins are likely to be transcription factors, however we cannot predict whether these candidates will turn their targets ON or OFF.

"Novel approaches to map DNA replication traffic in a genome-wide scale PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of the project is to establish novel genomics and bioinformatics approaches to model patterns of DNA replication in cells. It is known that the patterns of DNA replication are intimately linked to the cell type. These differences between cell types are relevant to the integrity of the genome during cell type transitions. For example, we recently found that damage during DNA replication is increased during the induced transition from one cell type to another. However, there is a lack of methodology to observe replication patterns in human cells. DNA replication differs between different cell types in the location of initiation, the direction of fork progression, and the timing of initiation and completion. There is currently no method that can comprehensively map the progression of DNA replication to the genome. Because of the importance of DNA replication in cell proliferation, there is need for the development of such methods. To be able to examine the progression of DNA polymerases in human cells, we will develop a novel methodology to map DNA replication genome-wide, by incorporating nucleotide analogs during DNA replication, and sequencing the resulting DNA molecules by Nanopore sequencing and recording the electrical signals. In parallel, we will develop novel bioinformatics approaches to reliably examine the electrical signals and identify bases or regions of DNA replication, for comparison between different cell types, or between healthy and diseased tissues. Successful establishment of this technology will greatly increase our knowledge of replication, genetic stability and cell proliferation, and allow the community to characterize differences in the progression of DNA replication between cell types. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will develop novel genomic and bioinformatics methods to map how DNA is replicated in the human genome in different cells or different diseases.

"Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Epigenetic memory is a phenomenon of trans-generational, altered trait inheritance without changes to DNA sequence. Our present ability to predict or direct epigenomic behavior is extremely limited, even though epigenetic factors participate in nearly all aspects of multicellular development, environmental stress response, and disease development. There are critical gaps in our current knowledge of DNA methylation patterning, stable epiallele formation, and the relationship of genome-wide epigenomic behavior to gene expression and phenotype in both plant and animal systems. We have developed a system that will directly address these questions. Our long-term goals are to decode the heritable epigenome, and its relationship to organismal phenotype, particularly in response to stress. What distinguishes our proposed research is the availability of robust biologicals in the model plant Arabidopsis to impose artificial stress, recurrent heritable epigenetic memory, and methylome repatterning. These resources emanate from discovery of the MSH1 gene, disruption of which leads to epigenomic reprogramming. Recent data from this system lead to the overarching hypothesis that stress-induced gene expression recruits methylation machinery to gene networks in a non-stochastic manner. To address this hypothesis, we have developed novel genome-wide methylome analysis procedures for high-resolution identification of gene-associated methylation repatterning. These analyses reveal gene networks that are strikingly consistent with phenotype changes, and display repatterning that is intragenic and often subtle, yet reproducible. We have also identified epigenetic components of the DNA methylation and RdDM pathways that are essential to reprogramming based on msh1 double mutant analysis. Building upon strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three specific aims to characterize trans-generational epigenomic behavior: (1) To delineate stable, de novo epialleles in the Arabidopsis msh1 model system, exploiting a five-generation memory lineage, (2) to develop a mechanistic understanding of stable epiallele formation in response to stress, implementing machine learning and mutant screening, and (3) to test locus-specific mechanics of epiallele establishment, capitalizing on gene relocation to delimit germane local chromatin features. The proposed research will broadly impact the field by providing the first example of inducible epigenomic reprogramming in a non-stochastic pattern that permits machine learning-based predictive modeling and identification of cis-acting sequence features. The results will be pertinent to mammalian systems and, possibly, to diagnostic strategies for diseases with a strong GxE component. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research has relevance to public health priorities as we see life style diseases, stress and environmental impacts on health, in utero and throughout development, pose greater challenges to conventional medicine. Environmental stress is a multifaceted influence on health, and epigenomic response is an important, under-investigated factor in cancer, neurodevelopmental, metabolic and toxin-related disorders with high GxE effects. Upon conclusion of the study, we will have defined the architectural features of stable, de novo epiallelic variation, assessed its influence on heritable phenotype, and refined a methodology for high resolution analysis of epigenomic data that is necessary to inform the development of early diagnostics and countermeasures.","Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint",9801992,R01GM134056,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chromatin ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Cytosine ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Medicine ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plants ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Splicing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Thermodynamic ', ' Thermodynamics ', ' Toxin ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' hydrosulfite ', ' hydrogen sulfite ', ' bisulfite ', ' Generations ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Arabidopsis ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Transgenes ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' mutant ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Small RNA ', ' Address ', ' Chromatin Modeling ', ' Chromatin Assembly ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Plant Model ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Cis-Acting Sequence ', ' Cis-Acting Locus ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Tissue-Specific Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression ', ' Differential Gene Expression ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' in utero ', ' epigenomics ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Heritability ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' public health priorities ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' screening ', ' methylome ', ' epigenome ', ' biophysical properties ', ' biophysical parameters ', ' biophysical measurement ', ' biophysical characterization ', ' biophysical characteristics ', ' transgenerational epigenetic inheritance ', ' transgenerational inheritance ', ' methylation pattern ', ' epigenetic memory ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2019,319720,0.037046929611994954
"From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding how the genome functions is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Encoded within its DNA sequences are the blueprints for several cell types. Nevertheless, it remains a mystery how the full variety of phenotypes arise, and how they are maintained. It is becoming increasingly clear that the epigenome— covalent modifications to the DNA and histone proteins—plays a crucial role. Genome-wide profiling of epigenetic modifications has clarified cell type specificity and the presence of a diverse set of combinatorial patterns that are strongly correlated with gene expression levels. Inferring causal relationships from these data has proved challenging, however. A working knowledge of the mechanisms that inform the establishment and regulation of the epigenome, and its impact on gene expression and cellular phenotype, therefore, remain elusive. In this project, we propose several novel modeling approaches which will address the key gaps in our understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and genome. First, we will parameterize a coarse- grained chromatin model from the bottom-up using a novel deep learning algorithm to generate an accurate and comprehensive characterization of chromatin secondary structure, and its sensitivity to DNA sequence, nucleosome repeat length, ionic concentrations, post-translational modifications, and phase-separated liquid- droplets formed by intrinsically disordered proteins. High resolution chromatin structures from this effort will elucidate how different epigenetic modifications impact gene expression by regulating nucleosome packaging and DNA accessibility. Second, we will investigate the role of epigenetic modifications in mediating long-range interactions between regulatory elements by developing a predictive model which will enable de novo reconstruction of three-dimensional genome organization. This project will result in a global view of the role of the epigenome in cell differentiation and cell fate determination. An improved understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and the genome from this research program can guide the development of engineering approaches to modify the epigenome for both long lasting and reversible changes as a novel strategy for combating diseases such as cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE The epigenome works hand-in-hand with the genome to encode cell phenotypic diversity for multicellular organisms. We will apply interdisciplinary approaches to disentangle the interrelationship between the two, thus elucidating the role of the genome in establishing and maintaining a robust epigenome, and providing mechanistic insight into epigenetic regulations of the genome’s function. Insights from our study will pave the way for rational epigenome engineering which holds great potential for transforming medicine and biotechnology.",From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization,9798562,R35GM133580,"['Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Engineering ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genome ', ' Histones ', ' Medicine ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Specificity ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' insight ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Chromatin Modeling ', ' Chromatin Assembly ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' reconstruction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' combinatorial ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' combat ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' epigenome ', ' epigenetic profiling ', ' epigenetic regulation ', ' Grain ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2019,377555,0.0738977338499339
"Neural-derived extracellular vesicles microRNAs in bipolar disorder: a peripheral window into the brain Project Summary/Abstract Bipolar disorder is a chronic and often severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic basis. However, even with significant progress made by molecular genetic studies, the few genetic variants associated with the disorder explain only a small portion of its heritability, which led to the hypothesis of the involvement of epigenetic alterations in BD’s pathophysiology. While recent studies have attempted to identify epigenetic biomarkers in BD, most results are limited due to the tissue specificity of epigenetic alterations and the biased assessments of candidate genes or genome-wide investigations through microarrays. Since the search for biomarkers have repetitively focused on peripheral measures that do not necessarily reflect brain alterations, significant biologically- and clinically-relevant findings have been significantly hindered. This study will fill this important gap by measuring epigenetic markers in plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the brain. Specifically, we will focus on microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs that have been recently proposed to mediate important mechanisms in BD and may integrate gene and environment stimuli. Of note, microRNAs- filled EVs are released by the neural tissue as a method of cell-to-cell communication and may be the key players in transferring epigenetic markers to germ cells, ultimately contributing to the inter- and transgenerational transmission of BD. Our working hypothesis is that patients with BD will show alterations in specific miRNAs and other non-coding RNA transcripts in plasma neural-derived EVs compared to controls. To test this, we will initially identify neural-specific EVs microRNAs in BD by analyzing blood samples from 60 healthy controls and 60 BD type I patients (already collected and stored in our Department) (Aim 1). After neural-derived EVs immunoprecipitation and characterization, RNA will be isolated and next generation sequencing libraries will be prepared and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq instrument with 1x75 bp single-end reads at an approximate depth of 10-15 million reads per sample. Significantly altered miRNAs will be validated by real-time PCR and the putative biological relevance of the differentially expressed transcripts will be assessed by functional pathway analyses. In addition, a machine learning model will be built using the miRNA expression data in order to predict whether an individual sample belongs to the BD or control group, allowing for the establishment of a clinically useful predictive biosignature that can have immediate impact in the field. On a second step we will investigate the correlation between neuronal EVs transcriptome markers with clinical, neuroanatomical, and neurocognitive parameters available for each subject, with the ultimate goal of identifying the clinical relevance of the newly- identified EVs markers in endophenotypes of illness (Aim 2). The identification of such brain-specific markers will likely open new avenues for scientific investigation of BD. Public Health Relevance Statement The proposed research is relevant to public health because bipolar disorder is a chronic and highly disabling condition with a strong familial aggregation, yet non-genetic mechanisms (such as microRNAs) underlying the disorder are still fairly unknown. The investigation of plasma neural-derived extracellular vesicles in bipolar disorder patients and controls and the development of a machine learning algorithm for the identification of a microRNA biosignature can lead to the identification of clinically relevant peripherally measured brain-specific biomarkers that can improve our understanding of the disorder and inform the development of

"Inferring gene regulatory circuitry from functional genomics data PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been known that methylation of genomic DNA correlates with gene expression. However, the structural mechanisms that underlie these observations remain obscure. In this project, we will pursue several innovative strategies for studying how methylation affects transcription factor (TF) binding. First, we will use Methyl-SELEX-seq – a novel experimental method developed in the previous cycle of this grant that uses barcoded mixtures of methylated and unmethylated DNA ligands – to create detailed maps of the effect of methylation on binding affinity for a broad panel of human transcription factors from various structural families. Second, we will perform detailed computational analyses and follow-up experiments to test the hypothesis that methylation causes local changes in DNA shape, which in turn modify TF binding affinity. We have shown that adding a methyl group in the major groove changes the geometry of the minor groove and enhances the electrostatic interaction between negative charges in the DNA minor groove and positively charged amino- acids in the TF. We will extend these analyses to other DNA modifications, as well as a wider range of DNA shape parameters and associated flexibility parameters. By building interpretable TF-DNA recognition models that integrate base, shape, and flexibility features using a powerful new machine learning framework developed in the previous funding cycle, we will make specific predictions regarding sequence and methylation readout mechanisms, and validate these using SELEX experiments with mutated TFs. To assess to what extent our quantitative models for binding to naked DNA built from SELEX data are predictive of binding to genomic DNA in the context of the living cell, we will perform detailed parallel analyses of SELEX and ChIP- seq data for Hox proteins and other TFs. Finally, to study the relationship between DNA binding and gene expression control in human cell lines, we will exploit Survey of Regulatory Elements (SuRE-seq), a novel massively parallel reporter assay that provides unique information about the autonomous transcriptional activity for each of >108 overlapping genomic fragments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epigenetic modifications of the human genome are known to play a key role in development and disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. The main goal of this proposal is to develop and apply new experimental and computational tools for analyzing how the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA is influenced by cytosine methylation.

"3D temperature control to study biological processes Project Summary Temperature control technology is necessary for a broad range of biologically relevant processes including organ-on-chip operation, biomolecular kinetics, cell growth, studying gene function with temperature-sensitive mutations, cancer cell resistance to hyperthermia treatments, protein crystallization, and DNA analysis. Most biosensing devices lack the needed temperature measurement accuracy and precise temperature control to understand the thermal mechanisms of these processes. For example, temperature variations of 0.2°C can activate heat shock proteins, increasing the resistance of cancer cells to thermal ablation treatment, but reported temperature accuracies are often near ±1°C. This proposal aims to revolutionize the biomedical temperature measurement and control ecosystem by developing technology, models, and validated devices capable of microscopic, spatially resolved temperature sensing and control at ±0.1°C accuracy (10x better than what is used in most biosensing systems). Microfluidics is a promising technology for an extremely broad range of biomedical applications that notably lacks the necessary temperature accuracies and spatial temperature control to effectively study biothermal mechanisms. This proposal intends to impact human health by developing disruptive temperature control tools to accelerate biomedical innovation in thermally sensitive processes. Our group recently demonstrated the capacity to measure temperature at a single point with fluorescent dyes, achieving a ±0.05°C noise floor by using machine learning techniques. We have also 3D printed a cell-based genotype and phenotype assay device with cell growth chambers, monoliths for mRNA capture & fluorescence measurement, and integrated pumps and valves in a volume of only 2.2 mm × 2.2 mm × 1 mm. Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal will build on these successes by developing 3D printing technologies that easily incorporate complex temperature sensing, heating, and cooling channels, coupled with multi-physics/CAD models to rapidly iterate through the prototype development cycle. These advances will be used in Aim 3 to construct a microscopically temperature-controlled chip to measure DNA melt curves to determine the zygosity of a Factor 5 Leiden. This will show that the technology can detect the subtle difference in melting temperature that is undetectable by most PCR machines, as a proof-of-concept before the technology can be applied to other biological process. The overall objective of these studies is to develop a suite of affordable technologies researchers can use to understand biothermal mechanisms to lay the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Project Narrative The instruments we use to study the effects of temperature on biological processes are less accurate than humans’ own ability to perceive temperature changes. The proposed research will develop improved microscopic temperature sensing & control technologies and demonstrate them by performing DNA analysis in a 3D printed device. Because the technology is cheap and accurate, it will be widely accessible to any lab, increasing our ability to understand the fundamental role biothermal processes have in disease occurrence, diagnosis, and treatment.",3D temperature control to study biological processes,9732034,R15GM132868,"['Automation ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Biosensing Techniques ', ' biosensing ', ' Biosensing Technics ', ' Cellular Growth ', ' Cellular Expansion ', ' cell growth ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Crystallization ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Engineering ', ' Environment ', ' labile factor ', ' labile component ', ' Proaccelerin ', ' Factor Pi ', ' Coagulation Factor V ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor V ', ' AC Globulin ', ' Factor V ', ' Floor ', ' Fluorescence ', ' fluorescent dye/probe ', ' Fluorescent Agents ', ' Fluorescence Agents ', ' Fluorescent Dyes ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' stress protein ', ' Heat shock proteins ', ' Heating ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Kinetics ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Persons ', ' Noise ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physics ', ' Printing ', ' Proteins ', ' Reagent ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' resin ', ' Plant Resins ', ' Risk ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Technology ', ' Temperature ', ' thermoreception ', ' temperature sensation ', ' Temperature Sense ', ' Testing ', ' temperature receptor ', ' Thermoreceptors ', ' Thromboembolism ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Custom ', ' Ecosystem ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Thermometry ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Pump ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' DNA analysis ', ' hyperthermia treatment ', ' hyperthermia therapy ', ' clinical hyperthermia ', ' Microscopic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Measurement ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Heat Stress Disorders ', ' heat-related illness ', ' Heat Stress Syndromes ', ' Heat Stress ', ' gene function ', ' Shapes ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' Electrical Engineering ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Venous ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3D ', ' 3-D ', ' High temperature of physical object ', ' high temperature ', ' innovative technologies ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' melting ', ' Thermal Ablation Therapy ', ' thermal tumor ablation ', ' thermal ablation ', ' graduate student ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' µfluidic ', ' Microfluidics ', ' Q-Dot ', ' Quantum Dots ', ' Institution ', ' Microfluidic Microchips ', ' microfluidic chip ', ' Microfluidic Lab-On-A-Chip ', ' Microfluidic Device ', ' Microfluidic Analytical Techniques ', ' Microfluidic Analysis ', ' Microfluidic Analyses ', ' Resolution ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' prototype ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' biological systems ', ' operation ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' 3D Print ', ' three dimensional printing ', ' 3D printer ', ' 3-D printer ', ' 3-D print ', ' Hyperthermia ', ' Geometry ', ' improved outcome ', ' sensor technology ', ' sensing technology ', ' organ on a chip ', ' organ on chip ', ' ']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,439058,0.02147188779375998
"An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in next generation–sequencing (NGS)-based molecular methods have illuminated the hierarchical organization of the genome and have shown that changes in the epigenome can promote or prevent the access of transcription factors (TFs) to specific DNA sequences, move genes between nuclear compartments, and build or remove the insulation between neighboring genomic regions. As changes in the epigenome and chromatin organization can derail precise transcriptional regulatory programs to change cell differentiation status or induce a pathological state, research in Dr. Li’s laboratory seeks to improve our ability to define and understand the impact of such changes across multiple layers of transcriptional regulation in the cell. The laboratory has effectively addressed the regulatory roles of DNA methylation in its previous and ongoing work and now extends its focus to hydroxymethylation. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), is a key epigenetic modification linked to transcriptional activation; however, 5hmC data and its genome properties have thus far been evaluated with limited integration of different genomic data types. Moreover, there is no integrative computational framework designed to interpret the functional role of 5hmC in the context of 5-methycytosine (5mC), enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, gene expression data, and DNA sequence information. This proposal will fill the growing need for user-friendly, interpretable, and extendable tools for mining 5hmC data toward laying a foundation for basic mechanistic studies of the epigenome and facilitate discovery of potential therapeutic targets in disease. Building on the investigator’s progress in revealing the dynamics of 5hmC and its impact on gene regulation, the proposal will now develop innovative computational tools for 5hmC data mining and data integration with other NGS datasets, with a focus on applying these tools to B cell differentiation, cancer, and embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Key goals over the next five years include developing a computational framework to mine short- and long-read sequencing data to answer the following questions: (1) How does 5hmC contribute to epigenetic heterogeneity? (2) How does 5hmC epigenetic heterogeneity contribute to transcriptome heterogeneity? (3) How do 5hmC levels and epigenetic heterogeneity communicate with histone modifications, enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, and chromatin organization? We will combine machine learning and network mining algorithms to enable knowledge discovery and data integration from diverse genomic data types. We will then harness the 5hmC data-mining framework to identify 5hmC patterns that correlate with ESC differentiation, B cell differentiation, and that contribute to the fitness advantage of cancer cells. This work is significant because it will be the first dissection of 5hmC’s contribution to local and long-range epigenetic heterogeneity and the first computational framework to uncover the cross-talk between DNA modifications and other transcriptional regulators via chromatin interaction data. Collectively, this work will yield a fuller picture of the molecular events that underlie fundamental changes in cell state and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Modifications of the genome that do not change the sequence of the DNA, called epigenetic modifications, can impact how genes are expressed and lead healthy cells into a disease state. Here we propose to develop computational tools to define how one type of epigenetic modification, called hydroxymethylation, impacts gene expression and ultimately cell behavior. These tools will be versatile and adaptable to any cell type of choice, enabling research into the molecular features of the genome that underlie both normal and pathological cell behaviors.",An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation,9798459,R35GM133562,"['Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Chromatin ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dissection ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Enhancers ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' cancer cell ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Nuclear ', ' embryonic stem cell ', ' stem cell of embryonic origin ', ' ES cell ', ' Property ', ' B cell differentiation ', ' B lymphocyte differentiation ', ' histone modification ', ' DNA Modification ', ' DNA Modification Process ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' genomic region ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' stem cell differentiation ', ' computer framework ', ' computational framework ', ' computerized tools ', ' computational tools ', ' data integration ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' differentiated B cell ', ' differentiated B lymphocyte ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' user-friendly ', ' cell behavior ', ' cellular behavior ', ' therapeutic target ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' epigenome ', ' learning network ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' genomic data ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data-set ', ' ']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2019,472500,0.08045344222011072
"A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy The purpose of this research is to provide a flexible prenatal genetic testing product that can be expanded to detect any inheritable trait as early as 5, and up to 20, weeks of gestation, from a safe, noninvasive Pap smear. Published studies, as well as our own experience, show that perinatal Pap collections using a cervical cytobrush pose no risk to mother or fetus, and captures trophoblast cells that migrate from the placenta into the reproductive tract. Trophoblast retrieval and isolation from the cervix (TRIC) efficiently isolates hundreds of trophoblast cells without limitations due to early gestational age, maternal obesity, or uteroplacental insufficiency disorders. In our report published in Science Translational Medicine, we isolated sufficient genomic DNA from intact fetal trophoblast cells obtained by TRIC at 5-19 weeks of gestation (n=20) to definitively distinguish maternal and fetal DNA by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of short terminal repeats (STRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Compared to massively parallel sequencing of cell-free fetal DNA from maternal serum, which has a fetal fraction of only 4-10% at week 10 of gestation, the complete genome obtained by TRIC has a fetal fraction of 85-100%, and provides nucleotide-specific haplotyping. In our Phase I award, we developed this technology for prenatal genotyping of single gene disorders located on the hemoglobin B (HBB) gene, using custom multiplex PCR amplification of SNPs, STRs and loci across HBB for NGS. We successfully haplotyped the locus for the sickle cell disease (SCD) point mutation and genotyped the remainder of the HBB exome, which includes alternate SCD loci, beta thalassemias and anemias. In Phase II, we will expand the test to include HBA1 and HBA1 genes (alpha thalassemias) to provide a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy screen. Phase I studies revealed that genotyping was consistently accurate, unless cervical specimen collection was suboptimal and <40 trophoblast cells were isolated. Commercialization will require operators to obtain adequate specimens. We will accomplish six milestones towards commercialization of this test: 1. Incorporate the HBA1 and HBA2 loci into a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy test. 2. Optimize success rates through operator training and innovations in collection device designs to increase cervical cell recoveries. 3. Innovate a novel alternative method to cytobrush-based cervical collection. 4. Automate the TRIC processing pipeline for high throughput cell isolation, DNA purification and NGS. 5. Establish sample quality assessment tools powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. 6. Perform a clinical validation trial to assess test performance. With an estimated annual market potential over $284 million for prenatal hemoglobinopathies testing, the envisioned technology will fill an existing gap in clinical diagnostics and outcompete existing invasive prenatal testing. Our initial commercial product will to enable management of high-risk pregnancies and provide valuable information to physicians and patients in the process of establishing families. Specifically, this initial product will benefit pregnancies at risk of having a child with SCA or other hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and anemia. This research provides major public health benefits by leveraging a safe, noninvasive method to capture fetal cells that migrate into the reproductive tract from a Pap smear for development of genetic tests to identify women carrying a fetus with an inherited disorder. We will build a DNA sequencing kit that can be commercialized to determine the genotype of fetuses at risk for sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies as early as 5 weeks of pregnancy. Advances emerging from the proposed research will generate new clinical tools for managing pregnancy complications to benefit the well-being of mothers and their babies.","A Platform for Safe,

"PiNDA - Fully integrated software platform for Preimplantation Genetic Testing - Aneuploidy (PGT-A) PROJECT SUMMARY  Since its inception 40 years ago, in vitro fertilization (IVF) has resulted in the birth of more than 1 million babies in the United States, and has revolutionized the field of reproductive medicine. Unfortunately, the success rate of IVF is still exceedingly low, especially for women >40 years old, with only 15.5% of implanted embryos resulting in pregnancy. This is partly due to the cytological method used for pre-implantation screening, which cannot detect the most common genetic defect during IVF, aneuploidy (i.e. chromosomal copy-number variation). Aneuploidy is linked to higher rates of miscarriage, and occurs more often in women >40 years of age; thus, aneuploidy has been a frequent target for genetic screening to improve IVF outcomes.  Pre-implantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) refers to a variety of techniques aimed at detecting changes in chromosomal copy number, with the goal of identifying high-quality euploid embryos for implantation. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have made it possible to screen embryos at higher levels of precision, and across a wider range of genetic defects, including mosaicism, triploidy and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Despite these remarkable advances, there are still significant challenges with PGT-A sequencing. Indeed, the most commonly implemented software for PGT-A (i.e. BlueFuse® ) are bundled with specific sequencing platforms (i.e. VeriSeq®), and are only designed to test for aneuploidy. Furthermore, existing pipelines are not user-friendly or customizable, which is a serious obstacle prohibiting the use of NGS by clinicians / embryologists. A more accessible bioinformatics platform is desperately needed that will bridge the gap between PGT-A sequencing and IVF outcomes.  Basepair™ is an innovator in efficient, user-friendly, web-based NGS analysis systems, with fully automated ChIP-, RNA-, ATAC-, and DNA-Seq bioinformatics pipelines available online. Here, Basepair will deliver PiNDA™, the first fully integrated software solution for comprehensive PGT-A analysis. In Aim 1, we will develop modules to test for specific chromosomal abnormalities, including mosaicism and triploidy, and validate each model with training data derived from somatic cell lines with known chromosomal aberrations. In Aim 2, we will integrate our modules into the PiNDA software system, creating a user-friendly, web-based interface that will perform full data analysis (raw data to full summary report) in <15 minutes, with no manual input required. Final data will be accessible via Basepair’s online portal, facilitating rapid data transfer from embryologists to physicians, and supporting the integration of NGS tests in IVF. Our innovative bioinformatics platform will accelerate NGS analysis for IVF, improving rates of pregnancy and advancing research in the success of IVF procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  In vitro fertilization (IVF) methods have begun to leverage next-generation sequencing technologies for pre-implantation genetic testing of aneuploidy (PGT-A), expanding the array of chromosomal abnormalities that can be accurately detected. However, the vast majority of software can only distinguish one type of genetic defect (i.e. aneuploidy), are difficult to use, and are tied to distinct sequencing platforms, limiting the clinical utility of resulting analyses. Basepair™ Inc. is a pioneer in user-friendly, web-based bioinformatics pipelines, providing comprehensive services for a wide range of sequencing projects. Here, Basepair will develop an inclusive suite of software for PGT-A, compatible with sequencing data from multiple platforms. This product will be of high value to the field and will help bridge the gap between advances in DNA sequencing and IVF technology.",PiNDA - Fully integrated software platform for Preimplantation Genetic Testing - Aneuploidy (PGT-A),9846492,R43HD100280,"['Spontaneous abortion ', ' Miscarriage ', ' Algorithms ', ' Aneuploidy ', ' Aneuploid ', ' Biopsy ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cell division ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' chromosome defect ', ' chromosomal defect ', ' Cytogenetic Abnormalities ', ' Cytogenetic Aberrations ', ' Chromosome Anomalies ', ' Chromosome Alterations ', ' Chromosome Aberrations ', ' Chromosomal Alterations ', ' Chromosomal Abnormalities ', ' Chromosomal Aberrations ', ' Aberrant Chromosome ', ' Chromosome abnormality ', ' growth media ', ' Culture Media ', ' Cytology ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Embryonic ', ' Embryo ', ' Feedback ', ' fertility promoting drug ', ' fertility medicine ', ' Infertility Drugs ', ' Infertility Agents ', ' Fertility Drugs ', ' Fertility Agents ', ' Test-Tube Fertilization ', ' Fertilization in Vitro ', ' Genetic Screening ', ' Goals ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' mosaic disorders ', ' Mosaicism ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' embryo attachment ', ' Ovum Implantation ', ' Nidation ', ' Embryo Implantation ', ' Blastocyst Implantation ', ' natural Blastocyst Implantation ', ' Physicians ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy Rate ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Specificity ', ' zoosperm ', ' Spermatozoa ', ' Sperm ', ' sperm cell ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' womb ', ' Uterus ', ' Woman ', ' Preimplantation testing ', ' Preimplantation genetic testing ', ' Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis ', ' Pre-implantation genetic testing ', ' Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis ', ' Preimplantation Diagnosis ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Summary Reports ', ' Reproductive Medicine ', ' Letters ', ' Morphology ', ' Triploidy ', ' triploidy syndrome ', ' chromosome triploidy syndrome ', ' 69,XXY syndrome ', ' 69,XXX syndrome ', ' 3n syndrome ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' early embryonic stage ', ' success ', ' Reporting ', ' Somatic Cell ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism Analysis ', ' Polymorphism Detection ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Aneuploid Cells ', ' Age-Years ', ' Copy Number Polymorphism ', ' copy number variation ', ' copy number variant ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' software systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' aneuploidy analysis ', ' egg ', ' Implant ', ' user-friendly ', ' implantation ', ' web based interface ', ' preimplantation ', ' pre-implantation ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' ChIP-seq ', ' chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ', ' ChIP Sequencing ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' screening ', ' cell free DNA ', ' cell free circulating DNA ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' ATACseq ', ' sequencing platform ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNAseq ', ' DNA seq ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' ']",NICHD,"BASEPAIR, INC.",R43,2019,279175,0.02360663907190686
"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes.

"Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation Abstract Large numbers of complete methylomes are being acquired through clinical sequencing projects, such as through The Cancer Genome Atlas, Blueprint Epigenome Project, and International Cancer Genome Consortium. Furthermore, third-generation nanopore sequencers, which detect DNA methylation and genetic variation in a single experiment, are nearly ready for routine clinical sequencing and will provide complete methylomes for all patients where whole-genome sequencing is indicated. Current analysis tools however only perform preliminary methylome processing and catalogue differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In order to transform methylome analysis into a clinically useful diagnostic/prognostic test, we need to develop predictive tools to interpret the functional and pathological consequences of identified methylation changes. Towards this goal, we have published a series of papers demonstrating that machine-learning based models utilizing high- resolution signatures of all methylation changes around a promoter vastly outperform conventional DMR methods. Our models accurately predict expression states at genes potentially regulated by methylation and reveal predictive methylation signatures that facilitate mechanistic interpretation. Nonetheless, several challenges remain before we can achieve our goals of translating genome-wide methylation data for routine clinical use: (1) To our knowledge, no current models integrate distal enhancers, whose activation is affected by DNA methylation. Such integrative analysis is necessary to understand consequences of methylation changes in cancers, whose genomes frequently undergo wide-spread methylation changes. In addition, such modelling will be essential to understand the role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which may play both repressive and activating roles in neurons depending on whether it is found at promoters or enhancers. (2) Our current models (and conventional approaches) represent methylation data independent of DNA sequence despite mechanistic studies demonstrating that methylation changes can have different functional effects depending on which sequences change and depending on the context of the local regulatory grammar. In this proposal, we will meet these challenges by first developing a predictive model that incorporates 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC at promoters and enhancers to determine how these marks act in concert. In particular, we will examine the hypothesized dual role of 5hmC as a repressor at promoters and as an activator at enhancers in cortical neurons. We will then use new advances in natural language processing to model DNA sequence and methylation to predict expression states. Our results will reveal which regulatory elements and transcription factors binding sites are affected by DNA methylation and how changes at different sites collaborate to affect expression changes. We will experimentally validate our in silico predictions using a combination of reporter assays and CRISPR- based epigenome-editing tools. Thus, the software tools we develop will form an important toolkit for the analysis and mechanistic interpretation of whole-genome methylation studies, both in the laboratory and clinic. Public Narrative DNA normally undergoes a variety of chemical modifications including the addition of methyl- and hydroxymethyl- groups to cytosines (DNA methylation). Though we are unsure how to interpret them, abnormal patterns of DNA methylation are often found in human diseases and will likely soon be routinely measured in the clinic. In this proposal, we will develop advanced computational approaches to predict the functional and pathological consequences of DNA methylation changes in disease. In the future, the approaches we develop will lead to software that suggests individualized therapies for patients based on clinical methylation data.",Computational modeling of DNA

"Predictable control of gene regulation through epigenetic engineering PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Recent landmark discoveries have revealed that in addition to DNA lesions, epigenetic mechanisms also play a major role in cancer. Epigenetics is mediated in part by interactions of proteins and DNA that confer heritable gene expression states. Drugging the cancer epigenome is a burgeoning medical technology that currently uses small molecule inhibitors and small RNAs to disrupt hyperactive epigenetic enzymes. The proposed work will test the hypothesis that a new modality, fusion proteins that interact with the chromatin fiber, will activate therapeutic genes at sites that bear a specific pattern of cancer-related biochemical marks. The specific aims are to (2) use bioinformatic analyses to discover chromosome features that support inducible changes in gene expression states and (2) to use protein engineering to identify determinants of nuclear protein engagement.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Current methods to reactivate dormant therapeutic genes in cancer cells are limited to inhibitors that bind epigenetic enzymes and other proteins.

"Joint patterns of multi-genetic/epigenetic factors via non-parametric clustering and their association with allergic disease Ray PA-16-162 Project Summary Eczema is a chronic skin inflammatory disease infecting 10-30% of children and 2-10% of adults and increasing. Researchers have struggled to understand the genetic and environmental factors that appear to play a role in eczema's increasing prevalence. The majority of current studies focus on one or two specific types of Genome-wide data in association with eczema such as SNPS, DNA methylation levels, or gene expression levels. Current statistical methods have forced this limitation as none exist, to our knowledge that allow clustering of subjects across multi-dimensional and multi-faceted variables. Therefore, in this project we aim to introduce a novel clustering approach that will cluster subjects across genes which contain SNP information, DNA methylation levels, and gene expression levels. Summarized clusters will then tested for associated risk of eczema or any allergic disease. Genetic patterns associated with eczema will then be further explored to better identify the behavior genetic data and it's uniqueness. The method will be built in R Gui as a free downloadable package making it accessible and easy to use. We will apply the proposed method to the third generation Isle of Wight cohort data. The third generation cohort data consist of children born (2010-current time) from the original cohort of children born between 1989 and 1990 on the Isle of Wight in the UK and contains Genome-wide datasets, disease and exposure status, and allergy information across multiple follow-ups. The implications of this study not only impact the statistical field with a new clustering approach but the eczema and allergy field as well as no other studies have been able to analyze three Genome-wide datasets in concert associated with the risk of allergic diseases. Ray PA-16-162 Project Narrative The prevalence of eczema is increasing world-wide and infecting between 10-30% of children. The complete underlying cause of eczema is unknown but thought to be mixture of genetic and environmental factors. This project aims to incorporate genetic and epigenetic data in concert using a novel statistical approach in hopes of identifying patterns associated with eczema risk, allowing researchers to better understand the biological mechanisms.",Joint patterns of multi-genetic/epigenetic factors via non-parametric clustering and their association with allergic disease,9629655,R03AI128227,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' eczematous ', ' Eczematous Dermatitis ', ' Eczema ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' behavior genetics ', ' Genetic Determinants of Behavior ', ' Behavioral Genetics ', ' Genome ', ' Health ', ' Allergy ', ' Hypersensitivity ', ' Joints ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood ', ' fetal cord blood ', ' Cord Blood ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Genetic ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' cohort ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Skin ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' vector ', ' genetic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' user-friendly ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Allergic Disease ', ' screening ', ' chronic inflammatory skin ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' multidimensional data ', ' high dimensional data ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R03,2019,69485,0.015974457128002113
"The Enzymatic Reader Project Summary At this point in time, it is generally understood and agreed upon that single-molecule sequencing (SMS) is the future of genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and epitranscriptomics due to its significant advantages over other technologies and methods. However, in order for these advantages to be fully realized, and for SMS to become the “gold standard” sequencing approach, significant issues and hurdles must be solved and overcome. During this program, Electronic BioSciences, Inc. (EBS) aims to demonstrate a completely new and enabling SMS method that will possess the ability to directly and correctly identify individual nucleotides, including chemically modified nucleotides. During this project, we will both demonstrate the ability of this entirely new sequencing approach to sequence DNA with high accuracy (directly comparing the obtained accuracy, throughput, error mechanisms and associated rates to other SMS approaches) and correctly identify (and sequence) 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its derivatives, at the single molecule level. At the conclusion of this Phase I project, we will have successfully demonstrated an entirely new and dramatically improved SMS approach, and reduced the associated risks involved with its full future commercial developments. There is a current need within the field of next generation sequencing (NGS) or so called third generation sequencing (TGS) for new, enabling instrumentation that is capable of high-accuracy, direct, native DNA sequencing, including the ability to correctly identify canonical and modified bases, homopolymer stretches, and sequence repeats. The entirely new SMS methodology that will be developed during this project will overcome known hurdles and limitations of currently available NGS, TGS, and SMS technologies, resulting in technology that is cost-efficient, highly accurate, easy to setup and utilize, capable of de novo sequencing and modified base calling, and yields highly simplistic data for easy analysis and post possessing. Through significant advancements made during this program, this resulting technology will revolutionize the use of the genome and epigenome, radically change standard R&D and clinical practices, and greatly advance clinical diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic decision making. Project Narrative The novel single-molecule sequencing (SMS) technology developed during this project will enable high- accuracy, direct, native DNA sequencing, including the ability to correctly identify canonical and modified bases, homopolymer stretches, and sequence repeats via a cost-efficient and easy-to-use methodology. The impact of these advances in SMS will eventually enable wide-scale, routine clinical care and diagnostics toward advanced precision medicine, not just R&D. The performance and accessibility of such technology will transform the understanding and application of genomics and epigenomics, the associated clinical practices, that ability to provide precision clinical diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic decision making for improved public healthcare and wellbeing.",The Enzymatic Reader,9677956,R43HG010427,"['Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Chemistry ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' DNA-Dependent DNA Polymerases ', ' DNA Polymerases ', ' DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase ', ' Electrodes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Future ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' instrumentation ', ' Ions ', ' lipid bilayer membrane ', ' Lipid Bilayers ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Noise ', ' Nucleotides ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Polymers ', ' Proteins ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Risk ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Reading Frames ', ' DNA polymerase A ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' DNA Primers ', ' Oligodeoxyribonucleotide Primers ', ' Chemicals ', ' Evaluation ', ' prognostic ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Therapeutic ', ' electric field ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' System ', ' Church ', ' Performance ', ' solid state ', ' Stretching ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Sampling ', ' single molecule ', ' Genomics ', ' Drops ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Polymerase ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Reader ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' epigenomics ', ' cost ', ' nanopore ', ' nano pore ', ' cost efficient ', ' transcriptomics ', ' clinical care ', ' clinical practice ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' NGS system ', ' NGS Method ', ' epigenome ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' clinical diagnostics ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' DNAseq ', ' DNA seq ', ' Third Generation Sequencing ', ' 3rd generation sequencing ', ' epitranscriptomics ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' ']",NHGRI,"ELECTRONIC BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R43,2019,231412,0.05076519457255534
"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIDA Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (OSGA) provides genomic and computational support to a large number of research scientists working on mechanisms and treatment of addiction. The two main research cores of OSGA are providing support for transcriptome, epigenome, and metagenome studies of rat models of addiction at many levels of analysis. We are also creating open access tools and a powerful web portal to catalyze more effective and replicable use of massive datasets generated by programs in addiction biology and treatment.","Overall

"Spatial Epigenomic Profiling of Immune Cell Signatures at Subcellular Resolution in Health and Disease SPATIAL EPIGENOMIC PROFILING OF IMMUNE CELL SIGNATURES AT SUBCELLULAR  RESOLUTION IN HEALTH AND DISEASE More than ten percent of childhood cancers are still incurable and need novel therapies. Epigenetic treatments deserve special attention with their specificity and reduced toxicity. Here I plan to explore epigenetic profiles of immune and cancer cells in normal development and blood cancer patients under the mentorship of Garry Nolan for single cell proteomics technology development, in collaboration with Howard Chang for implementation of epigenomic methods such as chromosome accessibility assays, and with Kara Davis for epigenetics studies of treatment resistant B cell subtypes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Epigenetic measurements have been limited to bulk level sequencing and ligation assays or limited number of imaging markers. To address these limitations, I will use an emerging three dimensional (3D) proteomic imaging technology in individual cells, termed as 3D Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) or 3D MIBI. Epigenetics research by 3D MIBI benefits from high degree multiplexing (up to 100 markers) and super resolution imaging capability (20 nm x-y; 5 nm z resolution), providing exciting opportunities to study genomic sites, methylated DNA, protein factors, and chromosome accessibility, all within the same experiments in single immune and aberrant (leukemic) cells. To systematically determine epigenetic states, I plan to utilize clonal B cell lines to decipher variability of epigenetic components including chromatin states, protein factors and modifiers by a fifty-marker 3D MIBI panel (Aim 1). These experiments will show distribution of epigenetic factors (linear or log-scale) in their expression levels and spatial variations (global or local) in the chromatin states. I will then perform experiments with primary B cells isolated from six different bone marrow aspirates of normal human subjects (Aim 2). I will correlate epigenetic signatures of each B cell subtype to corresponding development state (progenitor, pre, post, or mature). I will then perform an ex vivo co-culture of primary B cells on OP9 stromal cells over 1-6 weeks of culturing, which will be followed by fixation and profiling by 3D MIBI. These perturbation experiments will show how signaling events from neighboring cells drive necessary epigenetic conditions that are required for reaching a B cell subset. Finally, I will turn to primary B cells that are isolated from twenty newly diagnosed ALL patients (Aim 3). I will dissect differentiation and spatial epigenomic remodeling of responder B cell subsets and treatment resistant B cell subtypes from bone marrow aspirates using the OP9 co-culture. These will show how treatment resistance arises from a single epigenetic state or multiple distinct epigenetic signatures. I will then screen Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) on the same co-culture of B cell subtypes from ALL and stromal cells. By varying concentration and duration of inhibition conditions, I will dissect the role of epigenetic drugs in spatial chromatin remodeling toward development of epigenetic therapies in ALL. Together, these experiments will shed light on the role of epigenetic programming for cancer treatment applications from immune cell signatures in normal subjects and blood cancer patients. Public Health Relevance: Epigenetic alterations in immune and cancer cells regulate normal development and aberrant formation in humans. We reveal spatial heterogeneity and dynamic changes in epigenetic states of B cell subtypes from healthy and diseased subjects using a novel multiplex imaging mass cytometry. Deciphering the role of epigenetic perturbations in treatment resistant B cells will guide development of efficient and safe epigenetic therapies for pediatric blood cancers.",Spatial Epigenomic

"Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host pathogen dynamics Project Summary/Abstract Rapid and accurate methods to monitor tuberculosis (TB) treatment response do not currently exist. Efforts to improve outcomes have focused on early identification of rifampicin susceptibility followed by prompt treatment initiation and adherence monitoring. The rapid molecular susceptibility tests most often used give dichotomous cutoffs. Recent studies though show that minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) just below these breakpoints also predict poor outcomes. Even if a patient takes most of their therapy, clinical response can still vary substantially. Delays in sputum clearance (culture conversion from growth to no growth) can range from a few days to 5 months and failure or relapse rates can be as high as 20% in drug-susceptible TB. During the weeks to months of human infection and antibiotic treatment, in host Mtb populations experience substantial measurable genetic changes. These changes may be neutral or allow pathogen adaption to immune, antibiotic or metabolic pressure, e.g. low iron or cobalamin levels that may result in heritable drug tolerance and resistance phenotypes. Here we propose to study in host longitudinal pathogen dynamics including changes in population diversity over time and identify genes under selection to shed light on host-pathogen interactions. The study of in host pathogen dynamics can improve our understanding of cure from infection and pave the way for the use of whole genome sequencing for monitoring treatment response, circumventing the delays and biohazards of traditional culture-based approaches. We additionally propose the development of a genome- based predictor of MIC and to assess if MIC predictions are associated with delays in culture conversion and poor clinical response. We will systematically study pathogen samples from a well characterized TB treatment patient cohort (NIAID TRUST TB cohort in Worcester, South Africa -PI Dr. Jacobson) combining long and deep short-read sequencing to resolve full genome assemblies and variants at low allele frequency. We have strong preliminary data that long-read sequencing unmasks more Mtb genetic diversity than detectable by short-read sequencing alone and have previously characterized directional selection in a subset of genes including resistance loci, the B12 biosynthesis pathway, and PPE genes known to interact with host innate defense. The proposed work is enabled by our methodological expertise in population genetics, machine learning and resistance prediction for clonal bacteria like Mtb and will allow, for the first time, the study of directional and diversifying selection on the full repertoire of Mtb genetic variation. It will also allow the training of an MIC prediction model on a large ~17,000 isolate dataset curated across studies and geographies. Both study aims promise to inform our understanding of how pathogen genetic variation affects Mtb survival in host and the response to treatment. Project Narrative Patients with tuberculosis (TB) can benefit greatly if we could identify signs of poor response earlier and adjust therapy intensity accordingly. Innovations in DNA isolation and sequencing technologies now enable the study of TB pathogen populations in an individual patient with very high resolution. Here, we propose to use these technologies and a highly well-characterized cohort of South African TB patients to investigate how pathogen population genetic changes link to pathogen survival and treatment response, laying the foundation for improvements in clinical treatment monitoring using DNA sequencing.",Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host

"Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders. Abstract: Newborn screening (NBS) using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has transformed our ability to identify and provide early, lifesaving treatment to infants with inborn errors of metabolism. While MS/MS screening identifies most affected babies, it is accompanied by frequent false-positive results that require collecting blood and urine samples for additional confirmatory testing. While DNA sequencing has become an important part of confirmatory testing, newborn dried blood spots (DBS) yield only small and highly variable DNA amounts. There is an urgent need for a more efficient second-tier NBS approach for confirming all screen-positive cases directly from the DBS cards collected at birth. This is especially critical for infants at risk for metabolic disease in their first weeks of life. The overall objective of this proposal is to combine novel DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology to diagnose inborn metabolic disorders from DBS, and to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of this approach for second-tier screening. To achieve this objective, the following specific aims will be pursued: (1) Develop multiplex gene sequencing (RUSPseq) and 10X linked-read sequencing for rapid genetic diagnosis without the need for additional parental testing; (2) Develop mass spectrometry (Q-TOF/LC-MS) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning to identify novel metabolic markers, which will be integrated in a novel second-tier screening panel to separate true and false-positive cases; and (3) Demonstrate clinical and translational feasibility of this approach to more rapidly identify both true and false-positive cases. We will work with the public NBS program and NBSTRN’s Pilot Research and Implementation workgroup to translate this combined approach into second-tier NBS. These outcomes will have significant impact by reducing diagnostic delays and uncertainties, and by reducing iterative testing rounds and the cost associated with them, thereby reducing the burden on the healthcare system as well as patients and their families. Project Narrative: We will establish novel genetic and metabolomic technology for newborn screening (NBS) from dried blood spots, and apply machine learning to reduce false-positive screens and delayed diagnosis of true-positive cases. Early detection and confirmation of inborn errors of metabolism that can present in the first weeks of life is critical, specifically when screening in diverse multiethnic populations where we have less understanding of the biochemical genetic and clinical phenotypes. We will work with local hospitals and the NBS program to establish clinical and translational validity to this new project, which will contribute to maintaining parental trust in public NBS.",Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders.,10033377,R01HD102537,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Differentiation Antigens ', ' Differentation Markers ', ' Differentiation Markers ', ' Marker Antigens ', ' Archives ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Volume ', ' California ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Biochemical Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Newborns ', ' newborn child ', ' newborn children ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Inborn Errors of Metabolism ', ' Hereditary Metabolic Disorder ', ' inborn metabolism disorder ', ' Methods ', ' Neonatal Screening ', ' Newborn Infant Screening ', ' newborn screening ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Savings ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Compound Q ', ' Trichosanthin ', ' alpha-Trichosanthin ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Work ', ' Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ', ' CFTR ', ' CFTR Protein ', ' cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Trust ', ' Measurement ', ' Letters ', ' Metabolic ', ' Spottings ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' genetic diagnosis ', ' genetic disorder diagnosis ', ' tandem mass spectrometry ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' cost ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' screening ', ' carrier status ', ' genetic strategy ', ' genetic approach ', ' web-based tool ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' screening panel ', ' screening program ', ' random forest ', ' ']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,542483,-0.030166630867359184
"Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles PROJECT SUMMARY (Abstract) In addition to genetics and environment, interindividual variation in epigenetic regulation may determine risk of obesity. Exceptional genomic loci called metastable epialleles offer unprecedented opportunities to test this. Metastable epialleles – essentially epigenetic polymorphisms – exhibit interindividual variation in DNA methylation that is neither tissue-specific nor genetically mediated. Metastable epialleles were first discovered in mice when dramatic phenotypic variation was observed amongst inbred mice. Over the last 10 years we pioneered the discovery and characterization of human metastable epialleles. We have shown that DNA methylation profiling of multiple tissues in multiple individuals is an effective approach to identifying regions that exhibit systemic interindividual variation in DNA methylation, a hallmark of metastable epialleles. Now that we know epigenetic metastability is common to mice and humans, it is essential to identify and explore the full range of MEs in the mouse. We therefore propose to pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 - Perform an unbiased screen for mouse metastable epialleles. Aim 2 - Test for effects of maternal dietary methyl donor supplementation on offspring DNA methylation at metastable epialleles. Aim 3: Use comparative genomics to identify sequence determinants of epigenetic metastability. Successful completion of these Aims will provide the foundation for development of mouse (and potentially other mammalian) models which will enable controlled experiments to help understand how interindividual variation in DNA methylation affects risk of disease in humans. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Relevance Statement) Just as individual genetic variation can affect risk of disease, so too can individual epigenetic variation. In particular, special genomic regions called metastable epialleles, which were first discovered in mice, offer the best opportunities to advance our understanding of epigenetic etiology of disease because their systemic nature means that – like genetic polymorphisms – they can be assessed in any easily obtainable tissue sample, such as peripheral blood. Now that we know that metastable epialleles also exist in humans, we urgently need to develop a more complete catalog of these genomic regions in the mouse, to enable well- controlled experiments to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of interindividual epigenetic variation at these loci.",Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles,10032890,R01DK125562,"['Affect ', ' Base Sequence ', ' Nucleotide Sequence ', ' nucleic acid sequence ', ' Beds ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cleft Palate ', ' Developmental Biology ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Elements ', ' Embryo ', ' Embryonic ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Germ Layers ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Individuality ', ' Maps ', ' Methylation ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Paper ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Tail ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Toxicology ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' peripheral blood ', ' Individual ', ' non-human primate ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' diet supplementation ', ' Dietary Supplementation ', ' Micronutrients ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Catalogs ', ' cell type ', ' Maternal Nutrition ', ' Maternal diet ', ' maternal nutrition during pregnancy ', ' mother nutrition ', ' IAP Elements ', ' Intracisternal A-Particle ', ' Intracisternal A-Particle Elements ', ' DNA Fingerprinting ', ' DNA Profiling ', ' DNA Typing ', ' Genetic Fingerprintings ', ' Retrotransposon ', ' offspring ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' gene expression assay ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' Modeling ', ' Assisted Reproduction Technology ', ' assistive reproductive technology ', ' Assisted Reproductive Technology ', ' Genomics ', ' embryo culture ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Inbred Mouse ', ' Supplementation ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Seminal ', ' Nutrition Research ', ' Nutritional Study ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Outcome ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' obesity risk ', ' mouse genome ', ' murine model ', ' mouse model ', ' epigenetic variation ', ' critical period ', ' mouse development ', ' comparative genomics ', ' transgenerational inheritance ', ' transgenerational epigenetic inheritance ', ' genomic effort ', ' genomic strategy ', ' Genomic approach ', ' BS-seq ', ' Bisulfite-based sequencing ', ' bisulfite-seq ', ' bisulfite sequencing ', ' epigenetic regulation ', ' metabotype ', ' metabolic phenotype ', ' inter-individual variability ', ' interindividual variation ', ' inter-individual variation ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' early pregnancy ', ' gene locus ', ' genetic locus ', ' genomic locus ', ' ']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,500075,0.056278062840081175
"Identification of Transposable Element Insertions in the Kids First Data Project Summary Insertion of transposable elements (TEs, sometimes referred to as “jumping genes”) into the human genome can be pathogenic. Our aim in this project is to use sophisticated computational approaches to characterize TE insertions in the whole-genome sequencing data generated in the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program and identify any insertional mutations that may disrupt gene function. The large scale of the Kids First program provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the role of TE insertions in childhood cancers and structural birth defects, as well as to create a resource of reference TE maps that will be important for all other TE studies. We will first modify our existing algorithm called xTEA for the trio design of the Kids First studies and increase the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. Then, we will apply it to the thousands of trios that have been profiled in the Kids First program, using a pipeline optimized for the cloud environment. The resulting set of TE insertions (especially L1, Alu, SVA, and HERV insertions) will be curated with all relevant features and be made into a database for the community. We will also apply machine learning methods to improve the calls once a sufficient amount of training data have been obtained. To investigate the potential pathogenicity of the mutation, we will first focus on insertions within genes, but we will also explore those in regulatory elements inferred from epigenetic profiling data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transposable elements, or “jumping genes”, are genetic elements that can alter the DNA of an individual.

"Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline Project Summary Despite extraordinary advances in genome engineering, tools for precise and efficient gene correction and delivery across all cell types remain lacking. Current programmable DNA cleavage tools, such as meganucleases, Zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR- Cas9, rely on recruiting the DNA repair machinery, either using error-prone, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair for gene knockout, or homology directed repair (HDR) for precise correction. However, HDR is inactive in post-mitotic cells, such as neurons, and is often inefficient, achieving 50% correction at most. Genome editing still lacks efficient, robust tools that can insert, delete, and recombine large stretches of DNA sequence. Moreover, delivery tools are a significant barrier to deploying tissue-specific genomic engineering technologies as current vehicles, including widely-used viral vectors and liposomal approaches, have limited capacity, offer variable efficiency, and lack precise tissue tropism. The proposed work involves computationally mining bacteria for new classes of gene editing enzymes and delivery vectors. We know that natural recombinases and transposases can mediate programmed DNA rearrangement and insertion, and these classes of enzymes are present in phage defense and mobile islands in bacteria, which largely remain uncharacterized. Additionally, recent work has demonstrated that retroviral/retrotransposon gag-like proteins can self-assemble and encapsulate nucleic acid in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and viral-like particles (VLPs) for cell-to-cell communication. As with defense islands, these proteins can also be systematically catalogued via a bioinformatic pipeline and experimentally characterized. The proposed work will focus on three main goals: 1) signatures for phage defense, mobile genetic activity, or VLP-forming activity will be mined to build a machine learning pipeline for comprehensively discovering novel gene clusters from novel metagenomic sequences with a focus for proteins that can manipulate nucleic acid or self-assemble, 2) candidate gene clusters will be cloned from metagenomic samples and undergo high-throughput screening using biochemical and bacterial assays for gene editing and capsid formation, as well as engineering to hone activity, and 3) the most promising candidates will be evaluated for activity in mammalian systems with assays for highly efficient gene insertion and VLP formation. The work will elucidate novel bacterial phage defense and VLP biology, and result in the development of new technologies for more efficient genetic manipulation and gene delivery. Moreover, this gene exploration and engineering framework will serve as a model for discovering diverse bacterial gene clusters and defense systems, evaluating biochemical activity across a range of assays, and converting these findings into high impact biotechnologies. The developed technologies will accelerate the pace of biomedical research and enable greater exploration of basic biological processes and disease mechanisms. Project Narrative There are more than 5,000 human diseases caused by known genetic variation, including mutations, insertions, and deletions, but programmable tools and delivery vectors to reliably study and model these diseases are lacking. We propose a two-pronged approach to discovering novel gene editing and delivery strategies by (1) mining bacterial and archaeal systems to identify novel defense systems and enzymes that have activities useful for genome editing and (2) identifying gene clusters linked to extracellular vesicle or viral-like particle formation that will allow development of better gene delivery systems. The technologies developed from this work will accelerate the study and modeling of disease biology and provide a framework for general prokaryotic gene discovery across many biotechnological areas.","Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline",9873379,R21AI149694,"['Bacteria ', '

"Direct Determination of Multiple Specific Forms of DNA Chemical Modifications in Human Genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The information content of DNA is not limited to the primary sequence (A, C, G, T), but is also conveyed by chemical modifications of individual bases. For example, DNA methylation, specifically 5-methylcytosine (5mC), has been widely studied for its important regulatory roles in human development and diseases. In addition, the discovery of active demethylation of 5mC, mediated by TET enzymes, into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) revealed great insights into the dynamic nature of the human methylome and its close relevance to multiple human diseases. Beyond these chemical modifications to cytosine, recent studies by us and others discovered that N6-methyladenine (6mA), another form of methylation previously thought exclusively existing in bacteria and protozoa, also exists in eukaryotic genomes including the human genome. In addition to these epigenetic marks, different forms of DNA damages represent another category of DNA chemical modifications that are of important biological relevance. Although a few methods for mapping individual chemical modifications have been developed and some are widely used, it is usually hard for broad researchers to master every protocol to map each form of modification. While third- generation sequencing technologies support the direct detection of DNA modifications, they face fundamental challenges distinguishing among different forms of modifications. The objective of this project is to develop a novel technology for the direct mapping of multiple forms of DNA methylation and DNA damage events simultaneously. The core idea is that each form of nucleic acid modification has a unique signature in terms of their physical interaction with DNA polymerase, or nanopores in third-generation sequencing; and these signatures can be modeled by deep learning methods.

"Single Cell Transcriptomic and Genetic Diversity by Single Molecule Long Read Sequencing PROJECT SUMMARY Defining the features of cellular mixtures, where diverse cell types with distinct genomic characteristics are physically intermingled together, is a central problem in biology. During the past decade, single cell sequencing technologies have enabled a new era of high throughput and high resolution interrogation of cell type diversity, vastly expanding our understanding of the role that cell types play in development and disease. Yet, current studies in single cell genomics rely on short-read sequencing and thus suffer from limitations, including: (1) Most studies rely on short read counting which limits the study of alternative splicing. (2) Cell states are reflected by static snapshots, and while population dynamics can be deduced through trajectory and RNA velocity estimation, robust estimation of these parameters remains a major challenge. (3) Despite advances in single-cell DNA sequencing, there is yet no cost-effective way to simultaneously characterize both the genetic variants and transcriptome-level changes in a cell, which is crucial for diseases such as cancer. This proposal is motivated by technological breakthroughs in single-molecule sequencing (SMS) and the recent adaptation of SMS to the massively parallel sequencing of single cell transcriptomes in our lab. We propose to develop computational methods to harness the power of SMS in single cell transcriptomics. In particular, we have developed a new genomic approach which allows one to repeatedly interrogate complete transcripts from single cells using SMS long reads, rather than 3' or 5' counting with short reads. This technology allows experimental designs where specific transcript subsets and/or cellular subsets can be repeatedly targeted for deeper joint short and long read analysis over many iterations, which we will exploit to conduct analyses that were previously intractable.

"G-quadruplex DNA in senescence of the neurovascular unit Project Summary The neurovascular unit (NVU) is a functional structure that consists of endothelial cells, surrounded by an extracellular matrix, neurons, astrocytes, and pericytes. The NVU enables regulation of regional cerebral blood flow and nutrient delivery to the brain tissue. With aging, a structural weakening of the NVU occurs, which is also associated with inflammatory signaling and transport deficiencies. Critically, it is not clear how neurons, astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cells undergo senescence in the NVU, and whether there are differences in senescence pathways between healthy NVU aging and NVU in Alzheimer's diseases (AD). The G-quadruplex (G4) is a non-canonical DNA secondary structure formed by four DNA strands containing multiple runs of guanines. G4s play important roles in DNA recombination, replication, and regulation of transcription. In our data, we demonstrated that brain samples from aged mice contain more G4s than that of young mice. We showed that mice treated with a small-molecule G4 stabilizer develop cognitive impairment and accelerated brain aging. Using a heterochronic parabiosis mouse model, we also showed that the levels of G4s are decreased in the brain of old parabiont, compared to the age-matched iso-parabiotic mice, implicating presence of rejuvenating factors that can reverse the elevation of G4s with aging. The effect of the old parabiont on the young partner is more pronounced (more G4s in the young), suggesting a strong negative influence of aging factors. Importantly, in a mouse model of AD, we demonstrated that G4s are stabilized in the brains, well before the deposition of amyloid occurs. We hypothesize that these converging lines of evidence point at а mechanism of senescence. Thus, the primary objective of the proposed studies is to investigate G4-associated cellular senescence in the NVU, in aging and AD. In Aim 1, we will compare G4s across cell types in the NVU. In Aim 2, we will determine whether G4s preferentially accumulate in the NVUs of brain regions most vulnerable to neurodegeneration. In Aim 3, we will investigate how a peripheral factor, CXCL10, contributes to NVU's G4 senescence. G4s might be a novel pathway that can be targeted to mitigate the detrimental effects of cellular senescence in the brain. Project Narrative Senescent cells accumulate in aging and drive deficits accompanying age-associated diseases. This project investigates the role of a novel nuclear pathway, the G-quadruplex (G4) DNA pathway, in senescence of neurovascular unit (NVU) in the brain. The formation of G4 DNA is associated with chromatin remodeling, transcriptional changes, and DNA damage; we hypothesize that stabilization of G4s leads to senescence of the components of the NVU -

"VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data Project Summary VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Technological advances enabling the production of large numbers of rich, genome-wide, sequence-based datasets have transformed biology. However, the volume of data is overwhelming for most investigators. Also, we do not know the mechanisms by which the vast majority of epigenetic features regulate normal differentiation or lead to aberrant function in disease. We have formed an interdisciplinary, collaborative team of investigators to address the problem of how to effectively utilize the enormous amount of epigenetic data both for basic research and precision medicine. At this point, acquisition of data is no longer the major barrier to understanding mechanisms of gene regulation during normal and pathological tissue development. The chief challenges are how to: (i) integrate epigenetic data in terms that are accessible and understandable to a broad community of researchers, (ii) build validated quantitative models explaining how the dynamics of gene expression relates to epigenetic features, and (iii) translate information effectively from mouse models to potential applications in human health. These needs are addressed by the proposed ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenetic data to analyze mouse and human hematopoiesis, a tractable system with clear clinical significance and importance to NIDDK. By pursuing the following Specific Aims, the interdisciplinary collaboration will deliver comprehensive catalogs of cis regulatory modules (CRMs), extensive chromatin interaction maps and deduced regulatory domains, validated quantitative models for gene regulation, and a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. These deliverables will be provided to the community in readily accessible, web-based platforms including customized genome browsers, databases with facile query interfaces, and data-driven on-line tools. Specifically, the proposed work in Aim 1 will build comprehensive, integrative catalogs of hematopoietic CRMs and transcriptomes by compiling and determining informative epigenetic features and transcript levels in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and in mature cells. CRMs will be predicted using the novel IDEAS (Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System) method. Work proposed in Aim 2 will build and validate quantitative models for gene regulation informed by chromatin interaction maps and epigenetic data. Compiling and determining chromosome interaction frequencies will predict likely target genes for CRMs. Gene regulatory models will be built that predict the contributions of CRMs and specific proteins to regulated expression; these models will be validated by extensive testing using genome-editing in ten reference loci. Finally, work in Aim 3 will produce a guide for investigators to translate insights from mouse models to human clinical studies. This effort will include categorizing orthologous mouse and human genes by conservation versus divergence of expression patterns, assigning CRMs to informative categories of epigenomic evolution, and testing the interspecies functional maps experimentally by genome-editing. Project Narrative VISION: ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of hematopoietic epigenomes Blood cell formation is vitally important to human health because we must continually replace old and damaged cells, and because many diseases result from mis-regulation of gene expression during blood formation. Global measurements of proteins bound to DNA and their modifications help us find the genetic differences most likely to account for the aberrant gene expression at the heart of some diseases.

"A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy The purpose of this research is to provide a flexible prenatal genetic testing product that can be expanded to detect any inheritable trait as early as 5, and up to 20, weeks of gestation, from a safe, noninvasive Pap smear. Published studies, as well as our own experience, show that perinatal Pap collections using a cervical cytobrush pose no risk to mother or fetus, and captures trophoblast cells that migrate from the placenta into the reproductive tract. Trophoblast retrieval and isolation from the cervix (TRIC) efficiently isolates hundreds of trophoblast cells without limitations due to early gestational age, maternal obesity, or uteroplacental insufficiency disorders. In our report published in Science Translational Medicine, we isolated sufficient genomic DNA from intact fetal trophoblast cells obtained by TRIC at 5-19 weeks of gestation (n=20) to definitively distinguish maternal and fetal DNA by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of short terminal repeats (STRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Compared to massively parallel sequencing of cell-free fetal DNA from maternal serum, which has a fetal fraction of only 4-10% at week 10 of gestation, the complete genome obtained by TRIC has a fetal fraction of 85-100%, and provides nucleotide-specific haplotyping. In our Phase I award, we developed this technology for prenatal genotyping of single gene disorders located on the hemoglobin B (HBB) gene, using custom multiplex PCR amplification of SNPs, STRs and loci across HBB for NGS. We successfully haplotyped the locus for the sickle cell disease (SCD) point mutation and genotyped the remainder of the HBB exome, which includes alternate SCD loci, beta thalassemias and anemias. In Phase II, we will expand the test to include HBA1 and HBA1 genes (alpha thalassemias) to provide a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy screen. Phase I studies revealed that genotyping was consistently accurate, unless cervical specimen collection was suboptimal and <40 trophoblast cells were isolated. Commercialization will require operators to obtain adequate specimens. We will accomplish six milestones towards commercialization of this test: 1. Incorporate the HBA1 and HBA2 loci into a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy test. 2. Optimize success rates through operator training and innovations in collection device designs to increase cervical cell recoveries. 3. Innovate a novel alternative method to cytobrush-based cervical collection. 4. Automate the TRIC processing pipeline for high throughput cell isolation, DNA purification and NGS. 5. Establish sample quality assessment tools powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. 6. Perform a clinical validation trial to assess test performance. With an estimated annual market potential over $284 million for prenatal hemoglobinopathies testing, the envisioned technology will fill an existing gap in clinical diagnostics and outcompete existing invasive prenatal testing. Our initial commercial product will to enable management of high-risk pregnancies and provide valuable information to physicians and patients in the process of establishing families. Specifically, this initial product will benefit pregnancies at risk of having a child with SCA or other hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and anemia. This research provides major public health benefits by leveraging a safe, noninvasive method to capture fetal cells that migrate into the reproductive tract from a Pap smear for development of genetic tests to identify women carrying a fetus with an inherited disorder. We will build a DNA sequencing kit that can be commercialized to determine the genotype of fetuses at risk for sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies as early as 5 weeks of pregnancy. Advances emerging from the proposed research will generate new clinical tools for managing pregnancy complications to benefit the well-being of mothers and their babies.","A Platform for Safe,

"Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer ABSTRACT There is an unmet need for novel approaches to cancer research, including improved model systems. Pet dogs are among the most promising natural models for translational cancer research​. They share our environment and develop cancers with clear clinical, histological, and genomic similarities to human cancer. We propose to use new genomic technology and a direct-to-dog-owner approach to overcome existing limitations of the canine model. To accomplish this, we will use new liquid biopsy technology, which makes it possible to sequence ​tumor exomes in circulating cell-free DNA from a blood sample, and thus achieve deeper understanding of tumor genomics without invasive biopsies. The power of these minimally invasive sampling technologies is greatest in application to very large sets of clinical samples. Family dogs, whose environments are shared with humans and for which tumor genomics are similar to human cancers, offer an unparalleled model in which to assemble clinical sets of size sufficient both to confirm the relevance of known genetic pathways, and to identify new ones. We propose to combine the power of cell-free DNA sequencing, ​the enthusiasm of citizen-scientist pet owners, and the clinical experience of veterinarians. We will create a research portal for collection of information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcome for thousands of dogs with cancer, as well as their environment and lifestyle. W​e will also develop new computational methodologies to identify genomic similarities between canine and human cancers. Comparison of these canine and human mutational profiles will enable matching of canine cancer subtypes with human cancer subtypes based on genetic pathways, facilitating canine trials to advance human clinical studies. We aim to:  Aim 1. ​Develop software to Identify canine models for human cancers using genomic data and  comprehensive, histology-blind analysis approach.  Aim 2. Develop and optimize ​cell-free DNA sampling and sequencing methods in dogs, including  ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing.  Aim 3. Implement a ​direct-to-dog-owner smartphone app to collect and validate detailed clinical, and  environmental data, paired with blood samples, for thousands of dogs. By combining the power of genome sequencing and new liquid biopsy technology with the opportunity to collect large sets of samples from a species whose cancers are genomically reflective of those in humans, our project​ will​ transform​ the scale and scope of translational cancer research and precision medicine. Project Narrative Pet dogs live in the same environments that we do, suggesting that profiling mutations in dog tumors could guide treatment of human cancers. With the help of veterinarians and citizen-scientist dog owners, we will build tools and resources needed to study cancer in thousands of dogs at once. This will help scientists find important genetic features of canine cancers, match them to specific human cancers, and translate what we learn into new cancer therapeutics.",Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer,9891974,R37CA218570,"['Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Canis familiaris ', ' Canine Species ', ' Dogs ', ' Dogs Mammals ', ' canine ', ' domestic dog ', ' Environment ', ' Evolution ', ' Genes ', ' Gold ', ' Histology ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Silicones ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Histologically ', ' Histologic ', ' Veterinarians ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' human data ', ' cohort ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' Dog family ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Mutate ', ' Collection ', ' CCOP ', ' Community Oncology ', ' Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' oncogenomics ', ' cancer genomics ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' blind ', ' open source ', ' chemotherapy ', ' comparative ', ' tumor ', ' minimally invasive ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' comparative genomics ', ' exome-seq ', ' exome sequencing ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' cell free circulating DNA ', ' cell free DNA ', ' amateur science ', ' amateur scientists ', ' citizen scientists ', ' civic science ', ' crowd science ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' citizen science ', ' prediction of response ', ' predictive response ', ' predictor of response ', ' response prediction ', ' predicting response ', ' genomic platform ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' cancer sub-types ', ' cancer subtypes ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' liquid biopsy ', ' translational cancer research ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' smartphone Application ', ' translational model ', ' model of human ', ' human model ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' analysis pipeline ', ' classifier algorithm ', ' driver mutation ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R37,2020,653673,-0.02800069071150318
"Molecular images and machine learning to extract placental function from maternal cfDNA Abstract  Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state. cfDNA is fragmented with sizes centered around 145bp and 166bp which is approximately the length of DNA wrapped around a nucleosome, and a nucleosome plus its linker, respectively. Shorter fragments (30-100bp) also exist and have a clear periodicity of 10bp, corresponding to a turn of the DNA helix wrapped around the core histone. Recent reports have shown that the fragmentation sizes of cfDNA are tissue specific, which is a product of distinct nucleosome spacing that is inherent in the function of individual tissues. When these individual fragments are compared with existing epigenetic data from tissues, they can be binned into cell of origin simply based on whether they reveal the nucleosome positioning information of the originating tissue. Identifying cfDNA fragments of placental origin from maternal circulation would provide a non-invasive means of assessing placental function during human pregnancy.  Several major barriers inhibit cfDNA as a non-invasive method for examining placental function: 1) the ability to accurately identify the placental origin of the short <160bp cfDNA fragments that constitute regulatory information (paternal SNPs occur at frequency of approximately 1/2000bp). 2) the ability to use these fragments to piece together precise epigenetic states of the placenta. 3) the cost of deep whole genome sequencing that has traditionally been required to deconvolute epigenetic profiles of admixed cellular origins. Our goal is to overcome each of these barriers by exploiting state-of-the-art genomics and machine learning techniques to extract precise information about human placental function from cfDNA. We will first compile robust and accurate nucleosome information, including epigenetic and transcription factor occupancy, from the human placenta and then we will establish machine-learning platforms to elucidate placental cfDNA from maternal circulation at low cost. Success in this project will enable earlier intervention for high-risk pregnancies and facilitate the longitudinal, non-invasive real-time monitoring of pregnancy progression, thereby informing adaptive treatment decision-making. Narrative Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state.

"HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF MAMMALIAN ACTIVATION DOMAINS Project Summary Abstract Transcription factors (TFs) control gene expression by binding to DNA and either activating or repressing target gene expression. While our understanding of how TFs bind DNA has grown rapidly, our understanding of how TFs activate transcription once they are bound has not kept pace. As a result, when we identify a mutation in a patient in a TF, if this mutation is in the DNA binding domain, we can sometimes predict if it will disrupt function; if the mutation is in the activation domain, we have no ability to predict its effects. To address this gap, I propose to study the amino acid composition of acidic activation domains using high-throughput assays and modern computational analyses. I have recently developed a high-throughput assay for measuring thousands of designed activation domain mutants in yeast. Here, I propose to develop a similar method in mammalian cell culture. In Aim 1, I propose an in-depth study of a few activation domains as a model for how genetic variation impacts TF function. In Aim 2, I propose a broad survey of human transcription factors to search for new activation domains. In the independent phase of this grant (R00), I propose 2 more aims to investigate the mechanisms how TFs activate target genes. In Aim 3, I will functional classify different type of activation domains and search for common features of each time. In Aim 4, I will link activation domains to cofactors and look for the features that predict activation.] This proposal will create a new layer of annotation for the human genome: all regions that are sufficient to serve as activation domains, create a new genome-scale method and deliver computational models for predicting activation domains from amino acid sequence. This award will support training in mammalian experimental systems and advanced machine learning analysis. Together these aims will support the long term goal of reading the regulatory genome by predicting gene expression from DNA sequence. Project Narrative Transcription factors are proteins that bind DNA and turn target genes ON or OFF. When we sequence a genome, we can identify which proteins are likely to be transcription factors, however we cannot predict whether these candidates will turn their targets ON or OFF.

"Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Epigenetic memory is a phenomenon of trans-generational, altered trait inheritance without changes to DNA sequence. Our present ability to predict or direct epigenomic behavior is extremely limited, even though epigenetic factors participate in nearly all aspects of multicellular development, environmental stress response, and disease development. There are critical gaps in our current knowledge of DNA methylation patterning, stable epiallele formation, and the relationship of genome-wide epigenomic behavior to gene expression and phenotype in both plant and animal systems. We have developed a system that will directly address these questions. Our long-term goals are to decode the heritable epigenome, and its relationship to organismal phenotype, particularly in response to stress. What distinguishes our proposed research is the availability of robust biologicals in the model plant Arabidopsis to impose artificial stress, recurrent heritable epigenetic memory, and methylome repatterning. These resources emanate from discovery of the MSH1 gene, disruption of which leads to epigenomic reprogramming. Recent data from this system lead to the overarching hypothesis that stress-induced gene expression recruits methylation machinery to gene networks in a non-stochastic manner. To address this hypothesis, we have developed novel genome-wide methylome analysis procedures for high-resolution identification of gene-associated methylation repatterning. These analyses reveal gene networks that are strikingly consistent with phenotype changes, and display repatterning that is intragenic and often subtle, yet reproducible. We have also identified epigenetic components of the DNA methylation and RdDM pathways that are essential to reprogramming based on msh1 double mutant analysis. Building upon strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three specific aims to characterize trans-generational epigenomic behavior: (1) To delineate stable, de novo epialleles in the Arabidopsis msh1 model system, exploiting a five-generation memory lineage, (2) to develop a mechanistic understanding of stable epiallele formation in response to stress, implementing machine learning and mutant screening, and (3) to test locus-specific mechanics of epiallele establishment, capitalizing on gene relocation to delimit germane local chromatin features. The proposed research will broadly impact the field by providing the first example of inducible epigenomic reprogramming in a non-stochastic pattern that permits machine learning-based predictive modeling and identification of cis-acting sequence features. The results will be pertinent to mammalian systems and, possibly, to diagnostic strategies for diseases with a strong GxE component. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research has relevance to public health priorities as we see life style diseases, stress and environmental impacts on health, in utero and throughout development, pose greater challenges to conventional medicine. Environmental stress is a multifaceted influence on health, and epigenomic response is an important, under-investigated factor in cancer, neurodevelopmental, metabolic and toxin-related disorders with high GxE effects. Upon conclusion of the study, we will have defined the architectural features of stable, de novo epiallelic variation, assessed its influence on heritable phenotype, and refined a methodology for high resolution analysis of epigenomic data that is necessary to inform the development of early diagnostics and countermeasures.","Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint",9983094,R01GM134056,"['Affect ', ' Animals ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chromatin ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cytosine ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Information Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Medicine ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Methylation ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Plants ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Thermodynamics ', ' Thermodynamic ', ' Toxin ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' bisulfite ', ' hydrogen sulfite ', ' hydrosulfite ', ' Generations ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Arabidopsis ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Transgenes ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Diagnostic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' mutant ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Small RNA ', ' Address ', ' Chromatin Assembly ', ' Chromatin Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Plant Model ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Resolution ', ' Cis-Acting Locus ', ' Cis-Acting Sequence ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Differential Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Differential Gene Expression ', ' Tissue-Specific Gene Expression ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' in utero ', ' epigenomics ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Heritability ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' public health priorities ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' screening ', ' methylome ', ' epigenome ', ' biophysical characteristics ', ' biophysical characterization ', ' biophysical measurement ', ' biophysical parameters ', ' biophysical properties ', ' transgenerational inheritance ', ' transgenerational epigenetic inheritance ', ' methylation pattern ', ' epigenetic memory ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2020,319720,0.037046929611994954
"Spatial Epigenomic Profiling of Immune Cell Signatures at Subcellular Resolution in Health and Disease SPATIAL EPIGENOMIC PROFILING OF IMMUNE CELL SIGNATURES AT SUBCELLULAR  RESOLUTION IN HEALTH AND DISEASE More than ten percent of childhood cancers are still incurable and need novel therapies. Epigenetic treatments deserve special attention with their specificity and reduced toxicity. Here I plan to explore epigenetic profiles of immune and cancer cells in normal development and blood cancer patients under the mentorship of Garry Nolan for single cell proteomics technology development, in collaboration with Howard Chang for implementation of epigenomic methods such as chromosome accessibility assays, and with Kara Davis for epigenetics studies of treatment resistant B cell subtypes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Epigenetic measurements have been limited to bulk level sequencing and ligation assays or limited number of imaging markers. To address these limitations, I will use an emerging three dimensional (3D) proteomic imaging technology in individual cells, termed as 3D Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) or 3D MIBI. Epigenetics research by 3D MIBI benefits from high degree multiplexing (up to 100 markers) and super resolution imaging capability (20 nm x-y; 5 nm z resolution), providing exciting opportunities to study genomic sites, methylated DNA, protein factors, and chromosome accessibility, all within the same experiments in single immune and aberrant (leukemic) cells. To systematically determine epigenetic states, I plan to utilize clonal B cell lines to decipher variability of epigenetic components including chromatin states, protein factors and modifiers by a fifty-marker 3D MIBI panel (Aim 1). These experiments will show distribution of epigenetic factors (linear or log-scale) in their expression levels and spatial variations (global or local) in the chromatin states. I will then perform experiments with primary B cells isolated from six different bone marrow aspirates of normal human subjects (Aim 2). I will correlate epigenetic signatures of each B cell subtype to corresponding development state (progenitor, pre, post, or mature). I will then perform an ex vivo co-culture of primary B cells on OP9 stromal cells over 1-6 weeks of culturing, which will be followed by fixation and profiling by 3D MIBI. These perturbation experiments will show how signaling events from neighboring cells drive necessary epigenetic conditions that are required for reaching a B cell subset. Finally, I will turn to primary B cells that are isolated from twenty newly diagnosed ALL patients (Aim 3). I will dissect differentiation and spatial epigenomic remodeling of responder B cell subsets and treatment resistant B cell subtypes from bone marrow aspirates using the OP9 co-culture. These will show how treatment resistance arises from a single epigenetic state or multiple distinct epigenetic signatures. I will then screen Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) on the same co-culture of B cell subtypes from ALL and stromal cells. By varying concentration and duration of inhibition conditions, I will dissect the role of epigenetic drugs in spatial chromatin remodeling toward development of epigenetic therapies in ALL. Together, these experiments will shed light on the role of epigenetic programming for cancer treatment applications from immune cell signatures in normal subjects and blood cancer patients. Public Health Relevance: Epigenetic alterations in immune and cancer cells regulate normal development and aberrant formation in humans. We reveal spatial heterogeneity and dynamic changes in epigenetic states of B cell subtypes from healthy and diseased subjects using a novel multiplex imaging mass cytometry. Deciphering the role of epigenetic perturbations in treatment resistant B cells will guide development of efficient and safe epigenetic therapies for pediatric blood cancers.",Spatial Epigenomic

"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction.

"DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Project Summary: DNA Methylation and gene expression variations influence pituitary adenoma hormonal function and invasive growth Pituitary Adenomas (PAs) are among the most common intracranial tumors, and may cause hypopituitarism, neurological deficits, and lethal hormonal oversecretion disorders such as Cushing's disease and acromegaly. Although typically benign, PA invasion into surrounding dura, bone, and brain is evident in nearly half of symptomatic patients and is the major barrier to achieving long-term tumor control, hormonal remission, and normalized patient survival. Genetic mutations do not play a major role in the development or behavior of non-familial PAs, and a major knowledge gap exists in understanding the molecular underpinnings of PA hormonal function and invasive growth. Alternatively, epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) and gene expression alterations are known to influence PA phenotype, but these effects vary with gene location and context. Our team performed the first epigenome-wide pilot study to explore the association of DNA methylation and gene expression with PA behavior, and validated several genes implicated in PA hormonal function and invasion. Using a similar workflow, our overall goal is to define the role that DNA methylation and gene expression play in PA hormonal secretion and invasion in a larger study stratified according to PA hormonal subtype and invasion status. We hypothesize that: 1) variation in DNA methylation and expression is associated with subtype-specific PA hormonal function and invasion; 2) DNA methylation and expression data can be used to identify novel molecularly-defined PA classes and complement current PA diagnostic schemes; and 3) modulated expression of prioritized genes of interest will affect PA hormonal secretion and invasion in vitro. To test these hypotheses, we aim to: 1) use integrative epigenomic profiling and RNA sequencing approaches to analyze surgically-resected invasive and noninvasive PAs derived from a multi-institutional consortium, 2) discover novel molecularly-defined PA subtypes using DNA methylation and gene expression analysis, followed by development of a molecularly-based classification and unified diagnostic scheme, 3) identify candidate DNA methylation and gene expression markers associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion, 4) use established rat and surgically-resected human PA primary cell lines to test hormonal secretion and invasion phenotypes following modulation of expression of prioritized genes. Understanding the molecular pathways associated with PA hormonal secretion and invasion will provide practitioners with more precise diagnostic information and help to develop targeted drug therapies to curb or reverse PA hormonal oversecretion and invasion, thereby improving patient quality of life and survival. Knowledge derived from this study could help refractory PA patients by helping to mitigate lifelong risks associated with chronic hormone oversecretion, medications, radiation treatment, and repeat surgery. Project Narrative Pituitary adenomas (PAs) may cause significant disability or death due to hormonal oversecretion and neurological deterioration caused by invasive tumor growth. PA hormonal secretion and invasive growth are explained in part by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) affecting gene expression, rather than gene mutations. Our study will compare epigenetic and gene expression signatures in invasive versus noninvasive PAs of various hormonal subtypes, thereby providing key insights into gene pathways and mechanisms associated with PA behavior, aiding in the diagnosis and molecular classification of PAs, and helping to guide development of precision drugs to curb or arrest hormonal secretion and invasive growth

"An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in next generation–sequencing (NGS)-based molecular methods have illuminated the hierarchical organization of the genome and have shown that changes in the epigenome can promote or prevent the access of transcription factors (TFs) to specific DNA sequences, move genes between nuclear compartments, and build or remove the insulation between neighboring genomic regions. As changes in the epigenome and chromatin organization can derail precise transcriptional regulatory programs to change cell differentiation status or induce a pathological state, research in Dr. Li’s laboratory seeks to improve our ability to define and understand the impact of such changes across multiple layers of transcriptional regulation in the cell. The laboratory has effectively addressed the regulatory roles of DNA methylation in its previous and ongoing work and now extends its focus to hydroxymethylation. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), is a key epigenetic modification linked to transcriptional activation; however, 5hmC data and its genome properties have thus far been evaluated with limited integration of different genomic data types. Moreover, there is no integrative computational framework designed to interpret the functional role of 5hmC in the context of 5-methycytosine (5mC), enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, gene expression data, and DNA sequence information. This proposal will fill the growing need for user-friendly, interpretable, and extendable tools for mining 5hmC data toward laying a foundation for basic mechanistic studies of the epigenome and facilitate discovery of potential therapeutic targets in disease. Building on the investigator’s progress in revealing the dynamics of 5hmC and its impact on gene regulation, the proposal will now develop innovative computational tools for 5hmC data mining and data integration with other NGS datasets, with a focus on applying these tools to B cell differentiation, cancer, and embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Key goals over the next five years include developing a computational framework to mine short- and long-read sequencing data to answer the following questions: (1) How does 5hmC contribute to epigenetic heterogeneity? (2) How does 5hmC epigenetic heterogeneity contribute to transcriptome heterogeneity? (3) How do 5hmC levels and epigenetic heterogeneity communicate with histone modifications, enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, and chromatin organization? We will combine machine learning and network mining algorithms to enable knowledge discovery and data integration from diverse genomic data types. We will then harness the 5hmC data-mining framework to identify 5hmC patterns that correlate with ESC differentiation, B cell differentiation, and that contribute to the fitness advantage of cancer cells. This work is significant because it will be the first dissection of 5hmC’s contribution to local and long-range epigenetic heterogeneity and the first computational framework to uncover the cross-talk between DNA modifications and other transcriptional regulators via chromatin interaction data. Collectively, this work will yield a fuller picture of the molecular events that underlie fundamental changes in cell state and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Modifications of the genome that do not change the sequence of the DNA, called epigenetic modifications, can impact how genes are expressed and lead healthy cells into a disease state. Here we propose to develop computational tools to define how one type of epigenetic modification, called hydroxymethylation, impacts gene expression and ultimately cell behavior. These tools will be versatile and adaptable to any cell type of choice, enabling research into the molecular features of the genome that underlie both normal and pathological cell behaviors.",An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation,9986833,R35GM133562,"['Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dissection ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Mining ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Work ', ' Enhancers ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Transcription Activation ', ' Transcriptional Activation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Malignant Cell ', ' cancer cell ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' Nuclear ', ' ES cell ', ' stem cell of embryonic origin ', ' embryonic stem cell ', ' Property ', ' B lymphocyte differentiation ', ' B cell differentiation ', ' histone modification ', ' DNA Modification ', ' DNA Modification Process ', ' Transcription Regulation ', ' Transcriptional Control ', ' Transcriptional Regulation ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' genomic region ', ' Genomic Segment ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' stem cell differentiation ', ' computational framework ', ' computer framework ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' data integration ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' user-friendly ', ' cellular behavior ', ' cell behavior ', ' therapeutic target ', ' Knowledge Discovery ', ' NGS Method ', ' NGS system ', ' next gen sequencing ', ' nextgen sequencing ', ' next generation sequencing ', ' epigenome ', ' learning network ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' ']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2020,472500,0.08045344222011072
"Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the 6th leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Although up to 40% of adult patients are responsive to standard chemotherapy, almost all relapse and progress to resistant disease. Most AML patients display no cytogenetic abnormalities or driver mutations, which poses a significant challenge for designing targeted therapy. Combination therapy may also be useful for preventing resistance and improving overall survival. Recent advances in epigenomics have shed light on cellular reprogramming in cancer. Epigenetic proteins can modulate gene expression to induce pathways that increase cell proliferation and decrease differentiation. Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is an epigenetic protein overexpressed in AML. CARM1 has been identified as a key regulator of myeloid differentiation and cancer progression; and is overexpressed in primary, resistant, and recurrent AML. CARM1’s mechanistic role in AML induction and progression (including relevant substrates and regulation) is still unclear, which presents an additional challenge for clinicians to design new therapies. To address gaps in our current understanding of CARM1 function and the need for new AML therapies, I aim to (1) Identify compounds that target CARM1 expression and compounds that work in synergy with a known CARM1 inhibitor in AML and (2) Identify novel chemotypes that directly inhibit CARM1 using a hybrid approach of machine learning and simulations of small molecule-protein interactions. These aims support key goals of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Precision Medicine Initiative, including (1) understanding cancer progression, (2) genomic analysis, (3) advancing precision medicine, (4) bioinformatics and (5) translational research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the bone marrow, where immature cells accumulate and disrupt the production of normal blood cells, disrupting normal blood formation and organ function. Despite advances in research, AML patients are typically treated with chemotherapy agents that often fail to cure them and frequently lead to relapse.

"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA.

New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies – in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET – have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team. Project Narrative This project develops advanced computational methods for integrating information on the 3D structure of the human genome with large-scale genomics data sets generated by the ENCODE project to gain insight into cell-type specific chromatin state and gene regulation. These studies have broad relevance for understanding the regulation of gene expression in human cells and the disruption of gene expression programs in disease.","Encoding genomic architecture in the encyclopedia: linking DNA elements, chromatin state, and gene expression in 3D",9855022,U01HG009395,"['Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Atlases ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Elements ', ' Encyclopedias ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Genome ', ' Human Genome ', ' human whole genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Ploidies ', ' DNA Content ', ' DNA Index ', ' DNA Ploidy ', ' chromosome complement ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Peptide Signal Sequences ', ' Signal Peptide ', ' Signal Sequences ', ' protein signal sequence ', ' Specificity ', ' Technology ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Guide RNA ', ' gRNA ', ' Enhancers ', ' Mediating ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Published Comment ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' DNA Structure ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Chromatin Loop Domains ', ' DNA Loop ', ' Chromatin Loop ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Output ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' 3-D modeling ', ' 3D modeling ', ' three-dimensional modeling ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' next generation ', ' 3-D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' transcriptomics ', ' sequence learning ', ' genome annotation ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' DNase-seq ', ' DNaseI-seq ', ' DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing ', ' ATACseq ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' genomic editing ', ' genome editing ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' 3C-based approach ', ' 3C-based assay ', ' 3C-based method ', ' 3C-based strategy ', ' 3C-based technique ', ' 3C-based technology ', ' chromatin conformation capture ', ' chromosome capture ', ' chromosome conformation capture ', ' ChIA-PET ', ' Chromosome Interaction Analysis with Paired-End Tags ', ' Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' deep learning ', ' unsupervised machine learning ', ' unsupervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' ']",NHGRI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2020,742538,0.03563856320824353
"Inferring gene regulatory circuitry from functional genomics data PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been known that methylation of genomic DNA correlates with gene expression. However, the structural mechanisms that underlie these observations remain obscure. In this project, we will pursue several innovative strategies for studying how methylation affects transcription factor (TF) binding. First, we will use Methyl-SELEX-seq – a novel experimental method developed in the previous cycle of this grant that uses barcoded mixtures of methylated and unmethylated DNA ligands – to create detailed maps of the effect of methylation on binding affinity for a broad panel of human transcription factors from various structural families. Second, we will perform detailed computational analyses and follow-up experiments to test the hypothesis that methylation causes local changes in DNA shape, which in turn modify TF binding affinity. We have shown that adding a methyl group in the major groove changes the geometry of the minor groove and enhances the electrostatic interaction between negative charges in the DNA minor groove and positively charged amino- acids in the TF. We will extend these analyses to other DNA modifications, as well as a wider range of DNA shape parameters and associated flexibility parameters. By building interpretable TF-DNA recognition models that integrate base, shape, and flexibility features using a powerful new machine learning framework developed in the previous funding cycle, we will make specific predictions regarding sequence and methylation readout mechanisms, and validate these using SELEX experiments with mutated TFs. To assess to what extent our quantitative models for binding to naked DNA built from SELEX data are predictive of binding to genomic DNA in the context of the living cell, we will perform detailed parallel analyses of SELEX and ChIP- seq data for Hox proteins and other TFs. Finally, to study the relationship between DNA binding and gene expression control in human cell lines, we will exploit Survey of Regulatory Elements (SuRE-seq), a novel massively parallel reporter assay that provides unique information about the autonomous transcriptional activity for each of >108 overlapping genomic fragments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epigenetic modifications of the human genome are known to play a key role in development and disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown.

"From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding how the genome functions is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Encoded within its DNA sequences are the blueprints for several cell types. Nevertheless, it remains a mystery how the full variety of phenotypes arise, and how they are maintained. It is becoming increasingly clear that the epigenome— covalent modifications to the DNA and histone proteins—plays a crucial role. Genome-wide profiling of epigenetic modifications has clarified cell type specificity and the presence of a diverse set of combinatorial patterns that are strongly correlated with gene expression levels. Inferring causal relationships from these data has proved challenging, however. A working knowledge of the mechanisms that inform the establishment and regulation of the epigenome, and its impact on gene expression and cellular phenotype, therefore, remain elusive. In this project, we propose several novel modeling approaches which will address the key gaps in our understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and genome. First, we will parameterize a coarse- grained chromatin model from the bottom-up using a novel deep learning algorithm to generate an accurate and comprehensive characterization of chromatin secondary structure, and its sensitivity to DNA sequence, nucleosome repeat length, ionic concentrations, post-translational modifications, and phase-separated liquid- droplets formed by intrinsically disordered proteins. High resolution chromatin structures from this effort will elucidate how different epigenetic modifications impact gene expression by regulating nucleosome packaging and DNA accessibility. Second, we will investigate the role of epigenetic modifications in mediating long-range interactions between regulatory elements by developing a predictive model which will enable de novo reconstruction of three-dimensional genome organization. This project will result in a global view of the role of the epigenome in cell differentiation and cell fate determination. An improved understanding of the interrelationship between the epigenome and the genome from this research program can guide the development of engineering approaches to modify the epigenome for both long lasting and reversible changes as a novel strategy for combating diseases such as cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE The epigenome works hand-in-hand with the genome to encode cell phenotypic diversity for multicellular organisms. We will apply interdisciplinary approaches to disentangle the interrelationship between the two, thus elucidating the role of the genome in establishing and maintaining a robust epigenome, and providing mechanistic insight into epigenetic regulations of the genome’s function. Insights from our study will pave the way for rational epigenome engineering which holds great potential for transforming medicine and biotechnology.",From epigenome to genome and back: disentangling the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin organization,9986842,R35GM133580,"['Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cell Differentiation process ', ' Cell Differentiation ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Chromatin ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Engineering ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genome ', ' Histones ', ' Medicine ', ' Nucleosomes ', ' Organism ', ' living system ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Post-Translational Protein Processing ', ' Post-Translational Modification Protein/Amino Acid Biochemistry ', ' Post-Translational Modifications ', ' Post-Translational Protein Modification ', ' Posttranslational Modifications ', ' Posttranslational Protein Processing ', ' Protein Modification ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' insight ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cell type ', ' Pattern ', ' 3-D ', ' 3D ', ' three dimensional ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Chromatin Assembly ', ' Chromatin Modeling ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Element ', ' Resolution ', ' Chromatin Structure ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' reconstruction ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' combinatorial ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' combat ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' epigenome ', ' epigenetic profiling ', ' epigenetic regulation ', ' Grain ', ' deep learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2020,377555,0.0738977338499339
"Identifying Genetic and Epigenetic Risk Factors Regulating Gene Expression for Childhood Asthma Candidate: Dr. Soyeon Kim obtained her Ph.D. degree in Statistics at Rice University. For her doctoral research, she developed statistical machine learning methods to identify biomarkers for precision medicine approaches to treating lung cancer. She is currently a post-doctoral fellow at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP) and supported by a T32 grant awarded to one of her mentors, Dr. Juan C. Celedón. The goal of her research is to understand the pathogenesis of diseases by developing statistical methods for integrative analysis of multi-omics data. She is an author and co-author of eight manuscripts, including ones in high-profile journals such as Nature Genetics. Environment: CHP, affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine, is a leading pediatric center for clinical care, research, and educational excellence. Dr. Kim works in the Rangos Research Center, comprised of nine floors of state-of-the-art laboratories, offices, and conference facilities. In addition to superb mentoring by Drs. Wei Chen, Juan C. Celedón and George Tseng, she will use the Pittsburgh supercomputing center (PSC), an excellent source of computing powers for intensive bioinformatics work. Research: Although both single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and DNA methylation play important roles in regulating gene expression, the associations between SNPs/DNA methylation and expression of disease genes in childhood asthma are mostly unknown. Due to the multiple-testing problem, most studies focus on identifying the regulation of gene expression by cis- (nearby) DNA features, rather than a combination of cis- and trans (far from genes) regulation. To overcome the major multiple-testing problem, we will develop a novel statistical machine learning method that can handle a large number of variables of omics data without multiple- testing correction issues. In Aim 1, I will identify cis and trans genetic (SNPs) and epigenetic (methylation) factors that regulate gene expression in the nasal epithelium of asthmatic and healthy subjects. Through this analysis, I will uncover novel SNPs and methylation CpGs that may have not been found in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). In Aim 2, I will estimate the genetic and epigenetic contributions to the expressions of genes that are associated with atopic asthma. This study also will classify genes that are affected the most by genetic factors and genes that are affected mostly by epigenetic factors, which include environmental factors. In Aim 3, I will develop statistical methods to identify SNPs that indirectly regulate gene expression through methylation in nasal epithelium of asthmatic and healthy subjects. The outcome of this work will be a better understanding of the abnormal molecular and cellular mechanisms through which asthma develops, and the application of this knowledge to help to produce new therapies for asthma. Project Narrative 6 million children in the US suffer from asthma, and the likelihood that any child will develop asthma depends heavily on their genetic and epigenetic regulations. My statistical machine learning models will identify new genetic and epigenetic risk factors that are associated with childhood asthma by regulating the expression of disease-causing or disease-preventing genes.

"Epigenetic and transcriptomic determinants of Sjogren's Syndrome subtypes utilizing data from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) cohort ABSTRACT  Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease affecting the exocrine system, with hallmark symptoms of dry mouth and/or dry eyes caused by the dysfunction of salivary and/or lacrimal glands, respectively. While Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and other studies have increased our knowledge of genetic risk factors for SS, the disease etiology remains not well understood, and such risk factors have not been translatable to any immunological treatment options for SS. The NIH-NIDCR-funded Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) was established to improve the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of patients with SS by developing/validating standardized classification criteria for SS; and developing a rich biospecimen repository with clinical data to be used for future epidemiologic, pathogenesis, and genetic studies of SS.[1, 2] For this project, we will focus on genomic data and measures of the 2016 ACR-EULAR classification criteria, involving ocular, oral, and autoantibody manifestations. As shown in our previous work, the genetics of SS varies with ancestry; thus, we will cluster patients by both the criteria subphenotypes and genetic ancestry. We believe that accounting for disease heterogeneity in this way will enable us to more precisely identify disease pathways and mechanisms. Using previously secured funding, we are completing DNA methylation typing on LSGs in 373 SICCA patients and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on PBMCs of 86 SICCA patients who also have DNA methylation profiling. This data provides a unique opportunity for multi-omics analysis to determine correlates between LSG tissue epigenetics, peripheral blood cell-type distributions and cell-specific gene expression by SS subsets. First, using GWAS data and DNA methylation data from LSG biopsies, we will identify genetic and epigenetic modifications associated with subtypes of SS in SICCA patients. We will then examine the relationships between them by testing for genotype-specific methylation and expression, and utilizing mendelian randomization and causal inference testing to investigate causality between these measures. Second, we will analyze scRNAseq data to identify how cell types, states and cell- specific gene expression correlate with SS subtypes. Finally, we will integrate genetics, epigenetics, and transcriptomics to determine multi-omics profiles associated with SS subtypes. We will jointly model associated features from the genomic data to investigate causal pathways via correlation networks, conditional analysis, and machine learning. We anticipate that SS subtypes will exhibit specific relationships within the multi- omics data and that this will advance our understanding of SS disease processes, leading to better treatment targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our proposal leverages unique NIDCR-funded resources by utilizing existing infrastructure and data with high level expertise to better understand the pathogenesis of Sjögren's syndrome and identify new therapeutic pathways. We propose to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data recently generated on patients of the Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) biorepository/registry. We will identify genomic determinants of subtypes of SS derived from subphenotypes and genetic ancestry, which we believe will be more indicative of underlying biologic pathways and will lead to more appropriate genomic candidates for SS treatments.",Epigenetic and transcriptomic determinants of Sjogren's Syndrome subtypes utilizing data from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical

"Development of methods for transcript quantification and differential expression analysis using long-read sequencing technologies. The rapid development of Third Generation, Long Read Sequencing (LRS) platforms such as Pacbio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) have enabled increasing precision and higher-throughput sequencing of transcripts. Long reads can produce full-length transcript sequences, overcoming much of the uncertainty of short-read methods to accurately define transcripts, particularity for those genes with alternative splicing (more than 90% of human genes), for which short read sequencing has thus far proved difficult. LRS is therefore the natural choice for the study of the expression of transcript variants and of the role of alternative isoforms in disease and development. While the first iterations of the long-read technologies did not produce enough reads to quantify more than the highest expressed transcripts, the current sequencing depth of up to 8 million reads per SMRT cells on the Sequel 2 platforms promises reliable quantifiability for more modestly expressed genes. Also significant yield increases have been reported for Nanopore. This suggests that LRS may have reached sufficient throughput to enable accurate quantification of gene expression and differential expression analyses. LRS transcriptomics data have, however, specific properties that are absent in other transcriptomics technologies, such are partial matches of reference transcript models. Therefore specific methods for quantification and statistical analysis need to be developed. In this Project, we aim to characterize in detail the data distribution in long reads data, propose strategies to deal with their particular read uncertainty issues and develop new strategies for differential expression analysis. The overarching goal is to create the analytical framework to fully leverage LRS technologies for the study of isoform dynamics in relation of biomedical relevant questions. The goal of this project is to develop the SQANTI-QDE software, the first integral framework for the management of long read sequencing Iso-seq experiments. SQANTI-QDE will provide, in one tool, functionalities for the annotation and processing of multiple samples, improved definition of bona-fide transcripts, quantification of transcript expression, flexible creation of count matrices, data normalization, and differential expression and isoform usage analysis.

"Predicting gene regulation across populations to understand mechanisms underlying complex traits Project Summary Deeper understanding of the degree of transferability of genetic association results and implicated biological mechanisms across populations is essential for equitable precision medicine implementation and can only be accomplished by studying the genetic architecture of complex traits in diverse populations. In our initial project period, we have shown that genetic correlation of gene expression depends on shared ancestry proportions in African American, Hispanic, and European populations. We identified a subset of genes that are well-predicted in one population, but poorly predicted in another and showed these differences are due to allele frequency differences between populations. Our results demonstrate that when comparing predicted expression levels to the observed, a balance of the training population with ancestry similar to the test population and total sample size leads to optimal predicted gene expression. Our studies of lipid traits in Yoruba, Filipino and Hispanic populations uncovered key genes likely regulated by variants that are monomorphic or rare in European populations, demonstrating why studies in diverse populations are crucial. We have optimized genetic prediction models of gene expression levels in diverse populations and thus have broadened the scope of PrediXcan. In this proposal, we seek to (1) optimize global and local ancestry-aware omics trait prediction models within and across diverse populations and (2) predict the intermediate omics traits and perform poly- omic PrediXcan analyses of complex traits in GWAS cohorts from diverse populations. We have gathered data of multiple omics traits from diverse populations for this project (genome-wide genotype, RNA-Seq, methylomics, metabolomics, and microbiome). We will use machine learning to optimize genotypic prediction models of gene expression levels, splicing ratios, methylation, metabolite levels, and microbial diversity. We expect a range of predictive power will be observed across omics traits dependent on the heritability of each trait and differences in allele frequencies and effect sizes among populations. We will integrate regulatory data and previous results from larger European populations when appropriate to prioritize functional variants in our prediction models. For each omics trait, we will survey its genetic architecture to inform the best prediction models. Our models will account for global and local ancestry and we will quantify the ancestry specific components of each omics trait. We will test the predicted omics traits for association with phenotypes of interest using either raw genotypes or summary statistics. We will use colocalization methods to determine if the SNPs driving each omics trait prediction model are also those most associated with the phenotype and thus most likely to be causal. We will combine predicted omics traits in poly-omic models to determine which genes and biological pathways are implicated for a particular phenotype. Our team is well positioned to perform novel PrediXcan-based analyses of omics traits in diverse populations and promises to maximize impact by making our scripts, models, and results publicly available. Project Narrative Differences in DNA sequence among individuals can lead to differences in omics traits like gene expression, splicing, methylation, metabolite levels, and microbial diversity, which in turn can lead to trait differences. We have developed a method that harnesses DNA differences to predict omics traits, which are then tested for association with a disease or other trait of interest. Our project will lead to a better understanding of the degree of transferability of genetic association results across populations, which has the potential to improve the implementation of precision medicine among diverse populations and reduce health disparities.",Predicting gene regulation across populations to understand mechanisms underlying complex traits,9880471,R15HG009569,"['Authorship ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Awareness ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Mission ', ' Phenotype ', ' Publishing ', ' RNA Splicing ', ' Splicing ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Filipino ', ' Sample Size ', ' Genetic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Catalogs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' microbial ', ' trait ', ' Manuscripts ', ' novel ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabonomics ', ' metabolomics ', ' genetic association ', ' Data ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' microbiome ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' epigenomics ', ' Complex Genetic Trait ', ' epidemiological model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Balance training ', ' Population ', ' Heritability ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' dbGaP ', ' database of Genotypes and Phenotypes ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' RNA Seq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' genetic predictors ', ' Genetic study ', ' global gene expression ', ' global transcription profile ', ' transcriptome ', ' microbial consortia ', ' microbial flora ', ' microflora ', ' multispecies consortia ', ' microbiota ', ' TOPMed ', ' Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ', ' methylomics ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' genetic architecture ', ' multiple omic data ', ' Multiomic Data ', ' ']",NHGRI,LOYOLA UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R15,2020,436000,-0.017951597031140912

"Novel approaches to map DNA replication traffic in a genome-wide scale PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of the project is to establish novel genomics and bioinformatics approaches to model patterns of DNA replication in cells. It is known that the patterns of DNA replication are intimately linked to the cell type. These differences between cell types are relevant to the integrity of the genome during cell type transitions. For example, we recently found that damage during DNA replication is increased during the induced transition from one cell type to another. However, there is a lack of methodology to observe replication patterns in human cells. DNA replication differs between different cell types in the location of initiation, the direction of fork progression, and the timing of initiation and completion. There is currently no method that can comprehensively map the progression of DNA replication to the genome. Because of the importance of DNA replication in cell proliferation, there is need for the development of such methods. To be able to examine the progression of DNA polymerases in human cells, we will develop a novel methodology to map DNA replication genome-wide, by incorporating nucleotide analogs during DNA replication, and sequencing the resulting DNA molecules by Nanopore sequencing and recording the electrical signals. In parallel, we will develop novel bioinformatics approaches to reliably examine the electrical signals and identify bases or regions of DNA replication, for comparison between different cell types, or between healthy and diseased tissues. Successful establishment of this technology will greatly increase our knowledge of replication, genetic stability and cell proliferation, and allow the community to characterize differences in the progression of DNA replication between cell types.

"Novel Statistical methods for DNA Sequencing Data, and applications to Autism. Summary One of the major problems in human genetics is understanding the genetic causes underlying complex phenotypes, including neuropsychiatric traits such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. Despite tremendous work over the past few decades, the underlying biological mechanisms are poorly understood in most cases. Recent advances in high-throughput, massively parallel genomic technologies have revolutionized the field of human genetics and promise to lead to important scientific advances. Despite this progress in data generation, it remains very challenging to analyze and interpret these data. The main focus of this proposal is the development of powerful statistical methods for the integration of whole-genome sequencing data with rich functional genomics data with the goal to improve the discovery of genes involved in autism spectrum disorders. We propose to integrate data from many different sources, including epigenetic data from projects such as ENCODE, Roadmap, and PsychENCODE, eQTL data from the GTEx, PsychENCODE and CommonMind consortia, data from large scale databases of genetic variation such as ExAC and gnomAD, in order to predict functional effects of genetic variants in non-coding genetic regions in a tissue and cell type specific manner, and generate functional maps across large number of tissues and cell types in the human body that we can then use to identify novel associations with autism in whole-genome sequencing studies. The proposed functional predictions and functional maps will be broadly available in the popular ANNOVAR database. We further propose to use these functional predictions in the analysis of almost 20,000 whole genomes from three large whole genome sequencing studies for autism. We believe that the proposed research is very timely and has the potential to substantially improve the analysis of non-coding genetic variation, and hence provide new insights into the biological mechanisms underlying risk to autism, and more broadly to other neuropsychiatric diseases. Narrative Autism Spectrum Disorders are common diseases with major impact on public health. Although coding variation has been extensively studied for its role in affecting risk to autism, the analysis of non-coding variation poses tremendous challenges. The proposed statistical methods and their applications to nearly 20,000 whole genomes from three large autism whole genome sequencing studies will improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in autism with important implications for disease treatment strategies.","Novel Statistical methods for DNA Sequencing Data, and applications to Autism.",9923466,R01MH095797,"['Affect ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Chromatin ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Code ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Human Genetics ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' improved ', ' Anterior ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' cell type ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' functional genomics ', ' Functional RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Brain region ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Collection ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' epigenomics ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' data integration ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' large-scale data base ', ' large-scale database ', ' discover genes ', ' gene discovery ', ' treatment strategy ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ', ' GTEx ', ' Genotype-Tissue Expression Project ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' large scale data sets ', ' large scale datasets ', ' large scale data ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,446831,-0.010874141089534422
"REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  PROJECT SUMMARY  DNA motifs bind transcription factors (TFs) that control gene expression in normal and diseased skin. AR45192 recently mapped the enhancers and promoters that are sequentially activated during epidermal differentiation, and found them enriched for 15 conserved DNA motif combinations, or DNA motif “grammars”. This suggested that these grammars, acting through recruitment of motif-binding TFs, may encode the DNA sequence logic that coordinates the temporal and spatial induction of early and late epidermal differentiation genes. AR45192 also found that these grammars were recurrently altered by single nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs, for “expression SNPs”) linked by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to skin diseases characterized by disrupted epidermal differentiation, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This suggests that newly identified DNA motif grammars may control differentiation and that their disruption may contribute to disease pathogenesis.  Aim I will test the hypothesis that specific DNA motif grammars control the physiologic activation of differentiation genes necessary for normal epidermal function. First, it will define the temporal activity of hundreds of examples of each grammar in early and late differentiation within intact epidermis. Second, it will quantitate epidermal differentiation gene expression and barrier function in isogenic epidermal tissues in which a subset of grammars have been altered by gene-editing. Aim I is designed to characterize the actions of newly identified DNA motif grammars in epidermal differentiation.  Aim II will test the hypothesis that SCC risk eSNPs residing within epidermal differentiation motif grammars alter gene expression in a way that enhances cancer progression. First, it will define SCC eSNP impacts on gene expression in normal epidermis with a goal to understanding the altered target genes, and their biologic functions, that predispose to SCC risk. Second, it will quantitatively assess the impact of these SCC risk eSNPs, singly and in combination, on neoplastic progression of epidermal neoplasia in vivo. Aim II is designed to define the impact of regulatory DNA variants on epidermal gene expression and disease progression.  This AR45192 competing renewal will characterize the role of newly identified regulatory DNA grammars in epidermal homeostasis and neoplastic progression. RELEVANCE  Abnormal differentiation is a hallmark of common skin diseases, such as epidermal cancers, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and certain ichthyoses. Transcription factors (TFs) bind DNA motifs in enhancers to control differentiation gene expression in skin and other tissues. Characterizing the patterns of normal and disease-linked DNA sequence motifs that control epidermal differentiation may be of broad utility in the future treatment and prevention of skin disorders. REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  Project Narrative The control of gene expression determines the health or disease of human tissues, including skin. Systematic definition of the regulatory DNA motif combinations in homeostasis and early cancer progression is designed to provide information to advance human health for skin and other tissues. 1",REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION,9873543,R01AR045192,"['Dependovirus ', ' Adeno-Associated Viruses ', ' Dependoparvovirus ', ' adeno associated virus group ', ' Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Squamous cell carcinoma ', ' Epidermoid Carcinoma ', ' Planocellular Carcinoma ', ' Squamous Carcinoma ', ' Squamous Cell Epithelioma ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Atopic Dermatitis ', ' Atopic Eczema ', ' Atopic Neurodermatitis ', ' Disseminated Neurodermatitis ', ' allergic dermatitis ', ' allergic eczema ', ' Diploidy ', ' Diploid ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Epidermis ', ' Future ', ' Gene Activation ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Differentiated Gene ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Ichthyoses ', ' keratinocyte ', ' Kinetics ', ' Logic ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Neoplasms ', ' neoplasia ', ' neoplastic growth ', ' Proteins ', ' Psoriasis ', ' psoriasiform ', ' psoriatic ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Natural regeneration ', ' Regeneration ', ' regenerate ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' skin disorder ', ' Cutaneous Disorder ', ' Dermatoses ', ' Skin Diseases ', ' Skin Diseases and Manifestations ', ' cutaneous disease ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Generations ', ' Enhancers ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' cancer progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Genetic ', ' Reporter ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' human tissue ', ' Pattern ', ' Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma ', ' Epidermoid Skin Carcinoma ', ' skin squamous cell carcinoma ', ' bioengineered tissue ', ' engineered tissue ', ' Tissue Engineering ', ' Skin Tissue ', ' Prevention ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Genomics ', ' gene induction ', ' Skin ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' DNA Binding Interaction ', ' DNA bound ', ' DNA Binding ', ' keratinocyte differentiation ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' human disease ', ' ATACseq ', ' ATAC-seq ', ' cutaneous barrier ', ' epidermal barrier ', ' skin barrier ', ' knockin ', ' Knock-in ', ' recruit ', ' neural network algorithm ', ' ']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,504604,0.0753190742558395
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9878098,R01DC011805,"['Affect ', ' Botulinum Toxins ', ' Botulin ', ' Clostridium botulinum Toxins ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communication ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Dystonia ', ' Muscle Dystonia ', ' Exhibits ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Laryngeal muscle structure ', ' Laryngeal Muscles ', ' larynx muscle ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Social isolation ', ' Spasm ', ' Muscle Spasm ', ' Muscular Spasm ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Voice ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Family Medical History ', ' Family Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Family history of ', ' Laryngeal dystonia ', ' spasmodic dysphonia ', ' Spastic Dysphonias ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Deep Brain Stimulation ', ' Hereditary ', ' Inherited ', ' Oral ', ' Parietal ', ' Occupational ', ' Penetrance ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Focal Dystonias ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Molecular Target ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' clinical phenotype ', ' Gene variant ', ' allele variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' genomic variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' next generation ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' new diagnostics ', ' next generation diagnostics ', ' novel diagnostics ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' improve symptom ', ' symptom improvement ', ' symptomatic improvement ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' exome-seq ', ' exome sequencing ', ' screening ', ' accurate diagnosis ', ' Genetic study ', ' imaging marker ', ' imaging-based biological marker ', ' imaging-based biomarker ', ' imaging-based marker ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' brain abnormalities ', ' imaging genetics ', ' translational impact ', ' DNA seq ', ' DNAseq ', ' DNA sequencing ', ' Injections ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2020,696730,-0.05401233736733895
"Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias Abstract Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, play a significant role in human disease. DNA methylation is altered in cancer, and DNA methylation-induced silencing of promoters of tumor-suppressors is thought to play a key role in tumorigenesis. Though there is an increasing number of methylation sequencing datasets generated from cancer, they are confounded by tumor heterogeneity. Understanding the subclonal architecture underlying heterogeneity is important because individual cancer subclones impact cancer growth, treatment resistance, and metastasis. Increased “epigenetic heterogeneity,” or variation in DNA methylation patterns, was determined to be correlated with worse prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these studies only profiled epigenetic heterogeneity at a global scale and did not analyze methylation of individual subclones. Many computational methods have been developed for this purpose in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), but these methods are not applicable for methylation sequencing data. As such, there is a need to develop new computational methods to study subclonal methylation profiles in cancer. I will develop a novel computational method (DXM) that deconvolves DNA methylation of heterogeneous clinical samples into their major subpopulations, their prevalence, and their respective DNA methylation profiles (Aim 1). DXM will be developed on simulations generated from data available from both the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and the Blueprint Epigenome Project and will be validated with methylation sequencing on DLBCL samples. I will then leverage DXM to study subclonal methylation profiles in AML (Aim 2). I hypothesize that methylation can confer fitness advantages in epigenetic subclones of AML, leading to clonal expansion following therapeutic intervention and subsequent relapse. Using DXM, I will first identify epigenetic subclones from whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from AML patients with well-characterized genetic subclonal architecture and compare the epigenetic subclonal architecture to that of the genetic subclones. In a second dataset containing methylation sequencing data from paired diagnosis-relapse samples, I will apply DXM, identify subclonal methylation profiles, and characterize all genes impacted by subclonal methylation to determine if they are expected to confer fitness advantages. Finally, I will test if mutations known to impact DNA methylation in AML (DNMT3A, IDH1/2) alter epigenetic subclonal expansion. Taken together, this proposal will result in a new computational approach to interpret epigenetic data from heterogeneous clinical samples as well as identification of DNA methylation changes in epigenetic subclones of AML that contribute to disease progression and correlate with prognosis. Project Narrative Studies that characterize which variations in cancer relate to worse outcome may do analysis on the entire tumor sample, which is composed of many different types of cells, each with distinct biology. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel computational method to analyze variations in cancer at the level of cell-types. These results can be used to improve patient prognostics and care in multiple cancers.",Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias,9931169,F30CA224687,"['Algorithms ', ' Antibodies ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biology ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Computing Methodologies ', ' computational methodology ', ' computational methods ', ' computer based method ', ' computer methods ', ' computing method ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Acute Myelocytic Leukemia ', ' AML - Acute Myeloid Leukemia ', ' Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia ', ' Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ', ' acute granulocytic leukemia ', ' acute myeloid leukemia ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Mutation ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic defect ', ' genome mutation ', ' Neoplasm Metastasis ', ' Metastasis ', ' Metastasize ', ' Metastatic Lesion ', ' Metastatic Mass ', ' Metastatic Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Tumor ', ' Secondary Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Tumor ', ' cancer metastasis ', ' tumor cell metastasis ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Relapse ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Tumor Promoters ', ' United States ', ' X Inactivation ', ' Lyonization ', ' X-Chromosome Inactivation ', ' CpG dinucleotide ', "" 3'-5'-CpG "", ' CG-dinucleotide ', ' cytidine monophosphate guanosine ', "" cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine "", ' cytosine-guanine dinucleotide ', ' bisulfite ', ' hydrogen sulfite ', ' hydrosulfite ', ' Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting ', ' Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting Fractionation ', ' Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sortings ', ' Tumor Suppressor Genes ', ' Anti-Oncogenes ', ' Antioncogenes ', ' Cancer Suppressor Genes ', ' Emerogenes ', ' Onco-Suppressor Genes ', ' Oncogenes-Tumor Suppressors ', ' Recessive Oncogenes ', ' Tumor Suppressing Genes ', ' oncosuppressor gene ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Genetic Imprinting ', ' Parental Imprinting ', ' Genomic Imprinting ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Genetic ', ' DLBCL ', ' Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma ', "" large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma "", ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Frequencies ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' tumor suppressor ', ' Tumor Suppressor Proteins ', ' Retrotransposon ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clonal Expansion ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' resistance to therapy ', ' resistant to therapy ', ' therapeutic resistance ', ' treatment resistance ', ' therapy resistant ', ' epigenomics ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' lymphoma/leukemia ', ' leukemia/lymphoma ', ' Prevalence ', ' human disease ', ' tumor ', ' clinical care ', ' epigenome ', ' methylation pattern ', ' single cell sequencing ', ' BS-seq ', ' Bisulfite-based sequencing ', ' bisulfite-seq ', ' bisulfite sequencing ', ' EWAS ', ' epigenome wide association analysis ', ' epigenome-wide association studies ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' Intratumoral heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneity in tumors ', ' intra-tumoral heterogeneity ', ' intratumor heterogeneity ', ' tumor heterogeneity ', ' entire genome ', ' full genome ', ' whole genome ', ' ']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,47730,0.09241294427356919
