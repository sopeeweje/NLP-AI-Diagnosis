"COLLAGEN POLYMORPHISM IN NORMAL AND CIRRHOTIC LIVER In the two years of the granting period we have completed the localization by light and electron microscopy of four components of the hepatic extracellular matrix in normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic liver.  Collagen deposition in our system is a late event in the cirrhotic process, the earliest detectable change, is increased synthesis of fibronectin by the hepatocyte with subsequent deposition of this fibronectin in the space of Disse.  Our working hypothesis is that not only does fibronectin play a critical role in the fibrotic process, but that this role may be mediated by post-translational modifications in the fibronectin secreted by the injured hepatocyte.  We are proposing to complete the morphological studies initiated two years ago, obtaining precise quantitation (with computer-aided image analysis) of the changes in the hepatic extracellular matrix in the normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic liver.  New studies include:  The reversal of the cirrhosis induced by CCl4 and characterization and quantitation of the catabolism of this extracellular matrix during the reversal of the cirrhosis.  These studies will use light and electron immunohistochemistry combined with image analysis.  To characterize and quantitate the matrix produced by primary cultures of hepatocytes obtained from normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic livers using immunohistochemistry, quantitative rocket immunoelectrophoresis and electroimmunobloting.  We will use in vitro sublethal hepatocyte injury with CCl4 and compare the matrix secreted in vitro by these injured hepatocytes with that secreted by normal hepatocytes.  The last part of the proposal will initiate studies designed to characterize any possible changes in the fibronectin secreted by hepatocytes as a response to injury.  Plasma and tissue fibronectin from rats exposed to CCl4 will be compared with plasma and tissue fibronectin from normal rats.  The fibronectins will be characterized by PAGE, IEF, electroimmunoblotting and crossed immunoaffinity electrophoresis with ConA in the first dimension.  Using this combination of techniques it should be possible to detect any post-translational modifications in the fibronectin secreted by rat hepatocytes in response to chronic injury.

"NUTRIENT ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS & GASTRIC MUCOSAL INJURY We propose to investigate the role of nutrient essential fatty acids (EFA)-namely arachidonic and linoleic in the prevention and healing of gastric mucosal injury in the rat produced by ethanol, aspirin and taurocholic acid.  We will determine whether:  1) acute and/or chronic administration of EFA may a) prevent or reduce gastric mucosal damage or b) speed up healing of pre-existing injury; 2) diet deficient in EFA predisposes to gastric mucosal injury, increases its extent or delays healing, and the mechanism(s) responsible for these effects.  The rationale for these studies is that EFA are natural DIETARY precursors of prostaglandins which have been shown to protect the gastric mucosa against acute injury produced by damaging factors and to accelerate healing of gastroduodenal ulcers in man.  Studies will be performed on male Sprague Dawley rats receiving:  (1) single dose of EFA as a pretreatment or as a posttreatment of mucosal injury, (2) diet deficient in EFA for 10 weeks, (3) diet rich in EFA for 10 weeks, (4) diet sufficient in EFA (controls). Gastric mucosal injury will be produced by acute intragastric administration of absolute ethanol, acidified aspirin or taurocholic acid. Gastric mucosal damage, its healing and mucosal protection will be assessed:  A) macroscopically by scoring and computerized image analysis B) histologically with morphometric quantitation of necrosis C) by determination of mucosal cell proliferation kinetics D) ultrastructurally with scanning and transmission electromicroscopy E) functionally by measurements of ionic fluxes, potential difference and intragastric pH, and F) biochemically by measurements of luminal loss of DNA, protein and blood and the concentration or prostaglandins in the gastric contents.  TO EXPLORE THE MECHANISM(S) OF EFA PROMOTED GASTRIC MUCOSAL PROTECTION WE PLAN TO STUDY:  (1) THE EFFECT OF DNA AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS INHIBITORS AND OF MICROTUBULES AND MICROFILAMENTS DISRUPTIVE AGENTS ON EFA PROTECTION; (2) RESISTANCE OF RESTORED SURFACE EPITHELIUM TO SUBSEQUENT INJURY; (3) ACTION OF EFA ON ISOLATED GASTRIC MUCOSAL CELLS (SURFACE, PROLIFERATIVE ZONE) THEIR VIABILITY AND ABILITY TO GENERATE PROSTAGLANDINS.  Our long term objective is an assessment of the value (and application) of nutrient EFA in prevention and healing of gastroduodenal mucosal injury in man.
