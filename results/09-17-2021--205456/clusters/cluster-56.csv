"Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models Modern computational techniques based on machine-learning (ML) and, more recently, deep-learning (DL) are playing a critical role in realizing the precision medicine initiative. However, there is a critical need to systematically combine these powerful data-driven techniques with prior molecular network knowledge to make more accurate predictive models while also satisfactorily explaining their predictions in terms of mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. I propose to use domain specific knowledge from biology and computing to tackle three outstanding problems: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? ​Network-constrained Deep Learning for Metadata Imputation: ​​Most multifactorial phenotypes are tissue dependent and manifest differently depending on age, sex, and ethnicity. However, a majority of publicly-available genomic data lack these labels. I will develop a network-guided approach to predict missing metadata of samples based on their expression profiles by designing novel data-driven models where the model architecture and/or structure of the input data are constrained by an underlying gene network. ​Network-guided Functional Analysis of Genomic Data: ​​High-throughput experiments often generate lists of genes of interest that are hard to interpret. Functional enrichment analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool that attaches functional meaning to an experimental set of genes by summarizing them into sets of pathways/processes. However, standard FEA analysis is limited by incomplete knowledge of gene function, lack of context of the underlying gene network, and noise in expression data. I will address these limitations by developing a network-guided approach that jointly captures genes, their interactions, and their known biological pathways/processes into a common, low-dimensional space that facilitates deriving biological meaning by comparing the distance between the experimental gene set and the pathway/process of interest. ​Joint Multi-Species Genomic Data Analysis and Knowledge Transfer: ​​In particular, finding the optimal model system to use in a follow-up study based on genetic signatures derived from human experiments is challenging because genetic networks can be quite different from species to species. I propose to use data-driven models to embed heterogeneous networks comprised of human genes and model species genes into a common, low-dimensional space to better compare genetic signatures between two (or even multiple) species. I will apply these methods to three specific tasks, but I emphasize that the results of this study will be transferable to any other biological problem where complex gene/protein interactions are a major component. I have surrounded myself with a great support team and developed a strong professional development plan. The freedom and support provided by the F32 fellowship will be instrumental in achieving my goal of becoming a professor with an independent research group. This proposal aims to develop novel computational approaches that systematically combine prior molecular network knowledge, powerful data-driven computational techniques, and large transcriptome data collections to answer three critical questions in biomedicine: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? The core goal of my fellowship is to achieve this by infusing prior-knowledge into state-of-the-art data-driven statistical/machine learning methods so that we can overcome two major hurdles in studying complex, multifactorial traits and diseases: a) complex genetic interactions underlie multi-factorial traits and diseases, and b) these traits and diseases often differ in how they manifest from patient to patient.",Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models,9835005,F32GM134595,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development Plans', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fellowship', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Freedom', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'base', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'driving force', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'human data', 'human model', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical sciences', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'sex', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,61610,0.03045138465595152
"Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity Project Summary Our overarching goal is to understand how information characterizing genes and their function can be organized, integrated, and then generalized to new contexts. This is a central question of the post-genomic era, and one that becomes ever more pressing as novel assays expand the scope, breadth, and detail of information describing gene properties. While the Gene Ontology is the most prominent and universal system for organizing gene function, hundreds of others exist, often serving specialized research interests. Most laboratories depend on the validity of some subset of this data to design new experiments or interpret their results, but their quality is hard to directly ascertain, particularly in novel or complex integrative methodologies. Based on substantial preliminary data, we hypothesize that determining robustness and specificity will provide a highly general assessment of the utility of databases. We propose to use these properties to assess the entire corpus of resources organizing gene information, as well as the methods which exploit this information, and the results that they report. Critically, determining robustness and specificity does not require validation with respect to ‘gold standard’ information. By evaluating these resources with respect to their joint specificity and robustness we determine means of integrating and organizing their data for use in novel applications. Finally, we propose to apply our improvements in quality control to better target rare but robust results where this is an experimental goal, notably rare diseases and single cell expression. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Determine the uniqueness and robustness of data characterizing gene function. We develop a formal approach for characterizing robustness and uniqueness/specificity by exploiting prior probability in the form of gene multifunctionality. We will evaluate robustness and specificity across essentially all complex and structured databases characterizing genes. These measures can be compared between databases or over time and provide a global landscape of data structure. 2. Test methods designed to exploit information describing gene function. Statistical and machine learning methods exploiting structured data will be assessed for robust and specific output. Data features driving performance in diverse applications will be identified and complementary sources of data as well as community clusters will be defined. 3. Evaluate results that depended on the use of databases describing gene function. Using a combination of text-mining and figure-mining, we will assess the ongoing literature for novel, robust, and specific gene-function associations. We will characterize and evaluate the “dark matter” of gene-function association from both the point of unannotated genes as well as incomplete functions. Project Narrative Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene function in many different contexts and this data is captured in numerous resources which catalogue the varied properties of genes. The primary goal of this project is to explore and characterize the specificity and robustness of information about gene function within these databases. Because most biomedical experiments build on pre-existing knowledge, establishing guidelines for interpreting that data also has a large impact on our ability to understand novel results, particularly where they are unusual, as in many rare diseases.",Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity,9765396,R01LM012736,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Information Resources', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'comparative', 'dark matter', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2019,480000,0.04617169323927969
"Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation PROJECT SUMMARY  Studies are proposed to dissect one of the fundamental, binary development decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. The nematode C. elegans determines sex with remarkable precision by tallying X- chromosome number relative to the sets of autosomes (X:A signal): ratios of 1X:2A (0.5) and 2X:3A (0.67) signal male fate, while ratios of 3X:4A (0.75) and 2X:2A (1.0) signal hermaphrodite fate. We have discovered much about the nature and action of the X:A signal and its direct target, a master sex-determination-switch gene that also controls X-chromosome dosage compensation. However, a fundamental question remains: how is the signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? We pioneer new methods using machine learning neural networks to address this question with single-molecule and single-cell resolution. We also propose to dissect the functional interplay between chromatin modification and chromosome structure in regulating gene expression over vast chromosomal territories. X-chromosome dosage compensation in C. elegans is exemplary for this analysis: we found recently that dosage-compensated X chromosomes have (i) elevated levels of modified histone H4K20me1 compared to autosomes and (ii) a unique three-dimensional architecture. Both are imposed by the dosage compensation complex (DCC). Loss of H4K20me1 disrupts 3D architecture and elevates X gene expression. In the nematode DCC, one subunit is an H4K20me2 demethylase and five subunits are homologs of condensin subunits, which compact and resolve mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. All DCC subunits are recruited specifically to hermaphrodite X chromosomes by an XX-specific subunit that triggers binding to cis- acting regulatory elements on X (rex) to reduce gene expression by half. The DCC remodels the structure of X into topologically associating domains (TADs) using its highest affinity rex sites to establish domain boundaries. Despite this knowledge, important questions underlying the mechanisms of dosage compensation remain. What DCC subunits recognize the X-enriched motifs in rex sites to bind X directly? How does the DCC regulate RNA polymerase II to repress gene expression? What mechanisms underlie H4K20me1's control of chromosome structure, and how does DCC-mediated higher-order structure affect gene expression? Our findings should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state. Lastly, we will exploit our unexpected finding that rex sites have diverged across Caenorhabditis species separated by 30 MYR, retaining no functional overlap despite strong conservation of the core DCC machinery. This divergence provides an unusual opportunity to study the path for a concerted co- evolutionary change in hundreds of target sites across X chromosomes and the protein complexes that bind them. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our work dissects one of the fundamental, binary developmental decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. While we have discovered detailed molecular mechanisms about the nature and action of the signal that determines sex in the nematode C. elegans and its direct target, a critical question remains that we address: how is the sex signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? Our work also explores the functional interplay between chromosome structure, chromatin modification, and long-distance regulation of gene expression by studying X- chromosome dosage compensation. The nematode dosage compensation complex, a condensin complex, equalizes X-chromosome gene expression between the sexes by imposing a unique three-dimensional architecture onto hermaphrodite X chromosomes and by catalyzing enrichment of the modified histone H4K20me1 through a subunit that is a H4K20me2 histone demethylase. Results from exploring the connection between higher-order chromosome structure and chromatin modification should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state.",Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation,9699752,R35GM131845,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Caenorhabditis', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dosage Compensation (Genetics)', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth', 'Hermaphroditism', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Histones', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Meiosis', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mitotic', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Switch Genes', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'X Inactivation', 'autosome', 'chromatin modification', 'condensin', 'dosage', 'histone demethylase', 'male', 'man', 'neural network', 'protein complex', 'recruit', 'sex', 'sex determination', 'single molecule', 'tumor progression']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R35,2019,466290,0.020294956401429816
"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9751141,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Pan Genus', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'dark matter', 'drug development', 'fly', 'genetic association', 'genome annotation', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mitochondrial genome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peptide hormone', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'screening', 'terabyte']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2019,1186500,0.001926249469641249
"Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme Project Summary/Abstract Background: The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This motivation has led to the development of radiogenomics, the study of the connection between a tumor’s underlying molecular traits and its clinical and imaging phenotypes. Radiogenomic analyses provide an opportunity to identify “imaging surrogates” for inferring gene expression. This is clinically applicable for patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who routinely undergo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, current radiogenomic approaches make strong algorithmic assumptions, and results are potentially biased due to the many different ways that data is preprocessed and selected. The goals of this proposal are to (1) develop new radiogenomic models for identify imaging surrogates, and (2) systematically assess the robustness of radiogenomic findings. Aim 1: To evaluate the application of deep neural networks to discover radiogenomic associations. Aim 2: To compare resultant radiogenomic associations given different model inputs. Aim 3: To determine if the use of radiomic features increases specificity of radiogenomic associations. Methods: In Aim 1, deep neural networks will be trained on public GBM data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (gene expression), and The Cancer Imaging Archive (paired MR images). The model will take high-dimensional gene expression data and predict semantic imaging phenotypes derived from semi-automatically segmented regions-of-interest (ROIs) on MR images. To enable learning of deep networks, the gene expression profile of each patient will be parsed into numerous sparse vectors that encode molecular pathway information. After training, “activation maxi- mization” will extract imaging surrogates from the deep neural network. In Aim 2, a set of common feature selection methods will be applied to the gene expression data. Subsequently, the altered gene data will be the input to deep network to test their ability to derive consistent imaging surrogates. In Aim 3, radiomic features such as histogram and textural features will be extracted from the same ROIs segmented in Aim 1. Instead of semantic imaging phenotypes as the target output, the deep networks will take gene expression data and predict radiomic features. The inferred genes in each imaging surrogate from Aims 1–3 will be annotated with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using several major biological knowledge bases as reference gene sets. Enrichment scores will be normalized, assessed for significance using permutation testing, and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Long-term Objective: The development and systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods will help characterize the extent of overlapping information across biological scales in multimodal cancer patient data. Relevance to Public Health The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This research aims to develop new models to correlate tumor gene expression and its appearance in magnetic resonance images, and to perform a systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods to study their robustness in identifying meaningful biological mechanisms.",Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme,9656869,F31CA221061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Chips', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tweens', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'image archival system', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2019,39107,0.04900004696393929
"Addressing Open Challenges of Computational Genome Annotation We propose to capitalize on success of ongoing collaboration between the bioinformatics teams at the University of Greifswald (Germany) and at the Georgia Institute of Technology (USA) and address open challenges in computational genome annotation. In the course of this development, we plan to implement new algorithmic ideas and satisfy the needs of unbiased integration of different types of OMICS data.  We plan to address one of the long-standing problems at interface of bioinformatics and machine learning – automatic generative and discriminative parameterization of gene finding algorithms. Current methods of combining OMICS evidence frequently result in under predicting or over predicting tools. Having good understanding of the difficulties and the properties of different types of OMICS evidence we propose an optimized approach to the full unsupervised, generative and discriminative training.  We will introduce novel means to optimize integration of multiple OMICS evidence into gene prediction. These ideas will develop further the protein family-based gene finding implemented in AUGUSTUS-PPX. We propose to create representations of protein families for gene finding that for the first time include cross-species gene structure information.  We will develop a new approach that will unify two advanced research areas - transcript reconstruction from RNA-Seq and statistical gene finding that integrates RNA-Seq and homology information. We will describe a new, comprehensive model and EM-like algorithmic technique (the “wholistic” approach) to identify the sets of transcripts and their expression levels that best fit the available OMICS evidence.  We will also develop an automatic gene-finding algorithm for a full content of metagenomes including eukaryotic and viral metagenomic sequences. This task is conventionally considered too challenging. We propose a solution exploiting and advancing algorithmic ideas and approaches that we mastered in the course of creating gene finders for prokaryotic metagenomes as well as eukaryotic genomes.  All new tools will be available to the community under open source licenses. The goal of this project is to advance the science of genome interpretation by developing much needed computational methods and tools for high precision annotation of eukaryotic genomes and metagenomes. This advance will make an impact in research on model and non-model organisms including important human pathogens, parasites and viruses. New high throughput technologies generate volumes of sequence data on complex genomes as well as metagenomes. Still these big data volumes have to be transformed into scientific knowledge.

"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome SUMMARY The understudied protein targets that are the focus of the implementation phase of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project need to be placed in the contexts of gene-sets/pathways, drugs/small-molecules, diseases/phenotypes, and cells/tissues. By extending our previous methods, we will impute knowledge about the understudied potential target protein kinases, GPCRs, and ion channels listed in the RFA using machine learning strategies. To establish this classification system, we will organize data from many omics- and literature- based resources into attribute tables where genes are the rows and their attributes are the columns. Examples of such attribute tables include gene or protein expression in cancer cell lines (CCLE) or human tissues (GTEx), changes in expression in response to drug perturbations or single-gene knockdowns (LINCS), regulation by transcription factors based on ChIP-seq data (ENCODE), and phenotypes in mice observed when single genes are knocked out (KOMP). In total, we will process and abstract data from over 100 resources. We will then predict target functions, target association with pathways, small-molecules/drugs that modulate the activity and expression of the target, and target relevance to human disease. To further validate such predictions, we will employ text mining to identify knowledge that corroborates with the data mining predictions, perform molecular docking of predicted small molecules using homology modeling, and seek associations between variants and human diseases by mining electronic medical records (EMR) together with genomic profiling of thousands of patients. In addition, we will develop innovative data visualization tools to allow users to interact with all the collected data, and develop social networking software to build communities centered around proteins/genes/targets as well as biological topics including pathways, cell types, drugs/small-molecules, and diseases. Overall, we will develop an invaluable resource that will accelerate target and drug discovery. NARRATIVE The Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project will facilitate translational research by integrating and mining data about understudied druggable targets from numerous repositories and other resources. The KMC for IDG team will develop novel tools to analyze these data for the purpose of finding connections between genes/proteins/targets and diseases/phenotypes, cells/tissues, pathways/gene-sets, and drugs/small-molecules in order to identify potential applications to treat diseases and for other biological contexts of clinical relevance.",Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome,9623330,U24CA224260,"['Achievement', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Information Resources Management', 'Internet', 'Ion Channel', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Social Network', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Time trend', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'community center', 'computerized data processing', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'data visualization', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'druggable target', 'genomic profiles', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'online community', 'outreach', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'repository', 'response', 'side effect', 'small molecule', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning', 'web site']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2019,249999,0.026064909768057767
"High-throughput profiling of compound abuse liabilities and identification of addiction-related drug targets using an iPSC-enabled platform Project Summary/Abstract The scale of the US opioid addiction crisis clearly evidences the critical need for breakthroughs to assess compound abuse liabilities and to enable discovery of new analgesics with minimal abuse potential. We hypothesize that altered addiction-associated physiology can be modeled in co-cultured hiPSC-derived neuronal and astrocyte cells and detected by profiling gene expression alterations and associated phenotypic readouts. Our proposal addresses the significant lack of physiologically-relevant tools capable of profiling relevant molecular changes that underpin addiction in the human nervous system by executing Specific Aims that encompass: (1) generation of a panel of multicolor hiPSC-derived neuronal and astrocyte cells with stable lineage specific fluorescent reporters; (2) execution of a phenotype-based pilot machine learning-enabled predictive abuse liability screen; and (3) combination of phenotypic profiling and gene expression analysis to characterize the molecular and cellular changes associated with compound exposure. Successful completion of our project will deliver 2 significant advances: (1) an important new technical framework to assess abuse potential of candidate therapeutics early in the development process and (2) an innovative, scalable in vitro assay platform that enables discovery of targets and associated candidate therapeutics to mitigate addiction phenotypes. These innovations will position Cairn Biosciences to initiate drug discovery programs that will bring significant societal benefit by helping to stem the growth of the US opioid crisis and reduce the mortality rates and economic burden associated with this National Emergency. Project Narrative The ongoing opioid addiction crisis clearly evidences the need for new approaches to overcome addiction and mitigate the abuse liabilities of new therapies, yet a critical barrier to progress is the lack of in vitro assays in human cells to profile the abuse liabilities of therapeutics. Our project will deliver an innovative in vitro assay platform that enables 1) the assessment of abuse liability of candidate therapeutics early in development and 2) the discovery of targets and associated candidate therapeutics to prevent development of an addiction phenotype. These high impact advances align with government priorities such as the NIH HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term) initiative and will deliver significant additional benefit to public health by enabling identification of safer new therapeutics without addictive potential.",High-throughput profiling of compound abuse liabilities and identification of addiction-related drug targets using an iPSC-enabled platform,9912598,R44DA048686,"['Address', 'Analgesics', 'Astrocytes', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emergency Situation', 'Engineering', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Glutamates', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Array', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transfection', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'addiction', 'base', 'design', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'drug discovery', 'expression vector', 'healing', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'opioid epidemic', 'prevent', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein expression', 'stem', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapeutic candidate', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vector']",NIDA,"CAIRN BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2019,323750,-0.057744992007677756
"Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development Rotator cuff tears affect over 15% of Americans and impair shoulder joint biomechanics and function. Following repair of symptomatic tears, functional deficits frequently persist and re-tears are common, due to the complex anatomy and high functional demands on the rotator cuff tendons. Rotator cuff tendon tissue engineering research is focused on devices to improve immediate mechanical support to the repair and to stimulate early and rapid tendon regeneration rather than scarring and fibrosis, particularly for the supraspinatus tendon (SST), the most commonly torn tendon in the rotator cuff. Aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic both the highly aligned medial region of the SST, and bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the multi-axially aligned isotropic anterior region of the SST have been evaluated with promising results when seeded with adipose- derived stem cells (ASCs). However, progress in this area of rotator cuff tendon engineering and in other areas of tendon research is hindered by the lack of definitive markers for SST or for its regional heterogeneity, the lack of understanding to what extent ASCs are tenogenic and can assume the identity of tendon fibroblasts, the lack of specific markers for tendon fibroblast identity and tenogenic differentiation, and by a lack of markers for tendon maturation and response to mechanical loading in engineered tendon. Therefore, is it difficult to assess how successful current tendon tissue engineering approaches really are, or to predict how well tendon tissue engineered approaches will function in translation when autologous or allogeneic ASCs from diverse human populations are used to enhance rotator cuff repair via augmentation or interposition with engineered tendon devices. These studies will evaluate the epigenome (methylome), transcriptome, proteome, lipidome, metabolome and phenome (phenotype) of native human SST and donor-matched tissue engineered tendon produced from SST fibroblasts and ASCs. Bioinformatics approaches will be used to integrate the data to an integrated multiome, which will then be used with machine learning approaches to extract key causal ‘driver’ genes, or tendon specific genes or molecules responsible for: 1) SST heterogeneity between medial and anterior regions. 2) Tendon cell identity and the extent of tenogenesis by ASCs on electrospun scaffolds. 3) The heterogenetic response by ASCs on uni- vs. bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the native heterogeneity of the SST. 4) The response of engineered tendon to dynamic loading. Identified driver genes or molecules will be validated though over-expression or silencing approaches, thus providing therapeutic targets for manipulation to enhance tenogenesis, and engineered tendon development and maturation. Together these innovative studies will provide a template for improved external validity of benchtop tendon tissue engineering and pre-clinical studies towards successful translation in diverse patient populations. In addition, the bioinformatics and multiomics toolboxes and assays that result from this work will be invaluable to not only the tendon research community, but also to the wider musculoskeletal and regenerative medicine fields. A small number of driver genes in other medical fields are responsible for changes in expression and protein levels in hundreds of other genes, and subsequent tissue metabolism. The process of tissue engineered rotator cuff tendon development and formation as it relates to adult tendon after surgical repair is not well understood, despite rotator cuff tears being an important clinical problem and representing almost one third of orthopedic injuries. Evaluating changes in the ability of genes to be translated to proteins at the DNA, RNA, small metabolite, and protein level of tissue engineered tendon formation under different loading conditions compared to normal adult tendon will identify driver genes and potential new ways to improve currently available options for rotator cuff repair.",Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development,9684263,R01AR073882,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Allogenic', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biochemical', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Cadaver', 'Cells', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Engineered Gene', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Harvest', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Joint structure of shoulder region', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stimulation', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Natural regeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Seeds', 'Stem cells', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'design', 'epigenome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mechanical load', 'mechanical properties', 'metabolome', 'methylome', 'multiple omics', 'overexpression', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preclinical study', 'progenitor', 'regenerative', 'repaired', 'response', 'rotator cuff tear', 'scaffold', 'spatial relationship', 'supraspinatus muscle', 'tendon development', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'translation to humans']",NIAMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,485405,0.019683307629748664
"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9746755,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,400001,0.02814329912831939
"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs. Project Narrative/Health Relevance Advancing understanding of understudied kinases, a highly druggable class of proteins, will increase knowledge about signal transduction and control over cellular physiology and is likely to reveal a subset of proteins that should be advanced as targets for new therapeutic drugs.",Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome,9762097,U24DK116204,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Information Resources Management', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'design', 'human disease', 'human model', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knockout gene', 'knowledge base', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phosphoproteomics', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stable isotope', 'structural genomics', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'unsupervised learning']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2019,2265987,0.020283881631169128
"Colorectal Cancer Molecular Subtype Assay Development and Validation ABSTRACT Stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) demonstrates substantial variability in tumor biology and clinical outcomes and there is a need to understand prognosis for patients in order to gauge risk benefit for chemotherapy and intensity of chemotherapy administration. These features are not well recapitulated by the current biomarkers in use in the clinic, majority of them are DNA based mutation assays. RNA expression patterns have been described by various investigators and may more fully recapitulate tumor biology. The clinical utility of these findings have been limited by the apparent conflicting subgrouping efforts and lack of a validated gene expression signature as a clinical grade assay applicable on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. In our international collaboration with several academic leaders who have previously published in this field, we have identified a robust consensus subgroup classification based on clustering approaches independent of clinical outcomes. Remarkably, this classification system, termed consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), identified 4 subgroups that provide novel insights into the classification of CRC. One subgroup with mesenchymal, TGF-β, and angiogenic features (CMS4) is associated with a hazard ratio for death of 2.26 (95% CI of 1.41 to 3.61, P=.001), significantly higher than other subgroups, in a multivariate model inclusive of current clinical and pathologic risk factors and genetic signature (Oncotype Dx). We hypothesize that a gene expression signature classifier can be developed and validated for determining the CMS in FFPE tissues, and that this classifier can be implemented to improve prognostication of stage III CRC by classifying them in CMS 4 vs. other subtypes. We have developed a support-vector-machine classifier with very high accuracy for classification based on an Affymetrix array from fresh frozen specimens. We have demonstrated good classification accuracy (>90%) using customized Nanostring codesets on FFPE tumor samples of 85 patients with stage III CRC. We have also demonstrated good technical reproducibility in six of those 85 samples. In this application, we will transfer the assay using the Nanostring Codeset to fresh frozen (FF) and FFPE using a set of paired samples, while maintaining classifier performance. We will then pursue technical and analytic validation of the assay, including precision in repeatability, reproducibility between sample types, inter- lab reproducibility, and impact of RNA quality/quantity. In the UH3 portion of the grant, we will clinically validate the prognostic utility of the gene expression signature assay in single-institution cohort, and then in a completed prospective study of FOLFOX chemotherapy (NRG/NSABPC-08), in a CLIA certified laboratory. Additional data will be used in predicting response to various standard of care therapeutics, which represents a series of future potential applications of the assay. By utilizing an assay developed to classify CRC by its tumor biology, we anticipate development of an enduring tool that will be of greater use than traditional fit-for-purpose tests.   NARRATIVE The molecular characteristics of colon cancer can be described by RNA-based expression, and a consensus classification method has been developed.

"The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes PROJECT SUMMARY - HGNC The core objective of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is to enable effective communication and data exchange between everyone with an interest in human genes, by providing a unique, concise and standardized gene symbol and name for every human gene. As usage of genomic data increases in healthcare the need for a consistent language for genes becomes ever more vital. Aim 1 of this proposal will ensure the continuity of standardized naming of novel human protein-coding genes, long and small non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and pseudogenes. In particular all putative novel protein coding loci will require careful consideration; as active members of the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) consortium, HGNC can ensure that named loci accurately reflect the current expert manual annotations provided by consortium members. Aim 2 concentrates on renaming newly characterized human genes that are currently assigned a placeholder symbol; some genes with a phenotype-based nomenclature will also be considered for reassignment. These updates will reflect functional information, aid name transferal to orthologous genes, and avoid confusion. This round of revision will be a precursor to a nomenclature freeze for the majority of protein coding genes. Aim 3 focusses on coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, collaborating with the six existing vertebrate gene nomenclature committees (mouse, rat, chicken, Anolis, Xenopus, zebrafish) which base their naming on human gene nomenclature. As the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) this effort will be extended to naming genes in vertebrates lacking a nomenclature authority, such as cow, dog and horse. Recent gene naming in chimpanzee enabled creation of the necessary tools, pipelines and databases required for naming in other species. Assignments will reflect homologous relationships to human genes. Aim 4 will investigate the utility of machine learning in automated assignment of systematic nomenclature to long ncRNA genes and vertebrate orthologs, and potentially to pseudogenes. Models will be trained on manually curated datasets to learn both explicit and implicit practices, and then applied at scale. Aim 5 will ensure consistent naming across vertebrates in complex and divergent gene families, which can reveal some of the most interesting evolutionary biology and account for key diversity between species, but require careful manual curation. HGNC will collaborate with experts to expand the successful gene naming in the pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) family to further species, also working across species on two other complex key families involved in detoxification, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). HGNC will also work with experts to expand gene naming of olfactory receptors, the largest vertebrate gene family, from mammals to other well- studied model organisms such as zebrafish, Xenopus and chicken. HGNC is the only group worldwide providing systematic and user-friendly names for genes that are used throughout biomedical science and clinical practice; this is a crucial facility, with increasing importance and direct benefits for public health. To ensure effective communication between basic and clinical researchers, practicing clinicians and patients, there has to be a consistent well managed set of names for all human genes, which HGNC has provided since 1979. Having these names enables new discoveries, avoids confusion and prevents patient harm, by helping to ensure that everyone refers to a given gene using the same name.",The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes,9727999,U24HG003345,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cattle', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ensure', 'Equus caballus', 'Family', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Glucuronosyltransferase', 'Glutathione S-Transferase', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Nomenclature', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pan Genus', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudogenes', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Study models', 'Syntenic Conservation', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'Zebrafish', 'authority', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'gene product', 'genomic data', 'human genomics', 'interest', 'member', 'novel', 'olfactory receptor', 'parallelization', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vertebrate genome', 'web site']",NHGRI,EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY,U24,2019,550000,0.042761935373168955
"Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity Cortical GABAergic interneurons are critical components of neural circuitry, and their dysfunction has been linked to neurodevelopmental diseases. Although the diversity of interneurons is not disputed, both the extent of their heterogeneity and the gene regulatory mechanisms that drive it remain unclear. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing technology have shed new light on this issue, enabling the prediction of novel interneuron subtypes based on gene expression. Cross-species meta-analysis would provide key insight into conserved mechanisms of interneuron diversity. However, cross-study integration remains a major challenge. I hypothesize that interneuron identity is defined by unifying molecular processes across species. This project is designed to reveal these processes by using an integrative, cross-species approach to explore the transcriptional, epigenetic, and developmental mechanisms that govern interneuron diversity. First, I have shown that mouse interneuron subtypes replicably express genes associated with cell-cell communication, enabling cross-dataset meta-analysis. The goal of Aim 1 is to use improved computational and phylogenetic methods to define homologous interneuron subtypes across species and identify robust gene targets. Second, preliminary investigation of single cell methylome-sequencing data indicates that it can be readily aligned with expression data. In Aim 2 I will use machine learning methods to generate networks from epigenomic and expression data and identify subtype-specific regulatory features. Third, I have shown that transcriptional profiles from developing neurons can be quantitatively assessed with respect to adult expression data. Aim 3 will use meta-analytic aggregation of temporal inference methods to enable cross-dataset comparisons and define conserved developmental gene programs. These studies will reveal a multidimensional portrait of interneuron molecular identity and enable genetic access to these cell types, a key aim of the BRAIN Initiative. I also propose an extensive training plan that will support my transition to independence. CSHL provides an outstanding research environment, with unequaled opportunities for scientific discussion, advanced skills training and career development. I have assembled an exceptional team of collaborators and mentors who will help me to achieve my goals. Dr. Jesse Gillis, expert in transcriptome meta-analysis, and Dr. Josh Huang, expert in GABAergic interneuron identity, will be my mentors. Dr. Bing Ren, Dr. Adam Siepel, Dr. Guoping Feng, Dr. Jessica Tollkuhn and Dr. Michael Greenberg will be collaborators and members of my advisory committee, ensuring that my research will be of the highest caliber. My training will also involve coursework in multiomics data integration and comparative genomics, and I will continue my professional development by presenting at international conferences, mentoring students and attending workshops at CSHL. Together, the proposed studies and professional training will ensure my successful transition to an independent position at a major university where I will lead a lab that will advance the goals of the BRAIN Initiative. Interneurons are key components of neural circuitry, acting as the cellular `brakes' that dampen neuronal activity. Although it has long been known that interneurons come in many different shapes and sizes, both the extent of this diversity and its consequences for brain function remain unclear. In this project, we propose that by combining information about the gene activity and epigenetic landscapes of interneurons across multiple species we will generate an integrated, multi-layered portrait of interneuron diversity which we can use to understand brain",Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity,9754408,K99MH120050,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Maintenance', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Lateral Geniculate Body', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Portraits', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'career development', 'cell type', 'comparative genomics', 'data integration', 'design', 'developmental neurobiology', 'differential expression', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'methylome', 'neural circuit', 'neuroinformatics', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills training', 'student mentoring', 'symposium', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,K99,2019,118421,-0.0017113701841560065
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9706661,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web server']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2019,480000,0.04863158789155728
"Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis Abstract Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a significant human pathogen and is the leading cause of sporadic encephalitis in the USA. Strains of virus display virulence phenotypes ranging from avirulent to highly pathogenic. There are indications that the virulence of a given strain of virus is actually determined by the “constellation” of genes carried by the virus and how they interact with each other; a phenomenon termed epistasis. Traditional methods for analyzing the function of viral genes are difficult to apply to studying epistatic interactions in virulence. Recently we described a novel approach, vQTLmap, that has allowed us to identify contributions of multiple genes to peripheral disease phenotypes. To date we have analyzed four quantitative phenotypes, blepharitis, stromal keratitis, corneal neovascularization, and weight loss. Surprisingly, there are distinct differences in the viral genes that appear to be driving each of these phenotypes. In order to carry out vQTLmap using quantitative measures of neurovirulence, we need to isolate additional neurovirulent recombinants between the OD4 and CJ994 parental viruses. The goals of this proposal are to generate the reagents (e.g., neurovirulent recombinants) needed to analyze neurovirulence genes driving HSV-1 encephalitis and identify epistatic interactions and carry out vQTLmap analysis of percent mortality, percent ataxia, percent head tilt, and percent limb paralysis. At the completion of this project, we will be able to submit an R01 application to carry out vQTLmap on features such as percent mortality, brain titers of virus, localization of the infection in the brain, and neuroinvasiveness. A better understanding of how viral genes work together to promote disease has the potential to identify novel targets that could assist antiviral drug or vaccine development efforts. Narrative The role played by viral genes in determining the outcome of infection is poorly understood, particularly for Herpes simplex virus, which is an important pathogen. We have validated a novel approach involving generating recombinant viruses, determining the sequence of their genomes, and using novel statistical methods to map viral genes that affect the severity of the infection. In order to extend the analysis to neurovirulence (encephalitis), we need to isolate more neurovirulent recombinants. The goal of this application is to isolate additional HSV-1 recombinants so we can identify genetic drivers of encephalitis in the HSV-1 genome. The project ultimately has the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets for drug or vaccine development.",Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis,9666459,R21AI137280,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Ataxia', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blepharitis', 'Blindness', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Brain', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Corneal Neovascularization', 'Corneal Ulcer', 'Data', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Eye Infections', 'Female', 'Focal Infection', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Infection', 'Keratitis', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Reagent', 'Recombinants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simplexvirus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Physiology', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Work', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'human pathogen', 'innovation', 'male', 'mortality', 'neurovirulence', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'recombinant virus', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2019,191250,0.011636219496005976
"Repurpose open data to discover therapeutics for understudied diseases Project Summary/Abstract Many diseases are understudied because they are rare or of little public interest. The effect of each understudied disease may be limited, but the cumulative effects of all these diseases could be profound. One common research challenge for these diseases is that the resources allocated to each is often limited. For instance, large- scale screening of drugs is often challenging, if not possible, in small labs. The decreasing costs of next generation sequencing make possible the generation of gene expression profiles of understudied disease samples. Integrating these expression profiles with other open data provides tremendous opportunities to gain insights into disease mechanisms and identify new therapeutics for understudied diseases. We have utilized a systems-based approach that employs gene expression profiles of disease samples and drug-induced gene expression profiles from cancer cell lines to predict new therapeutic candidates for hepatocellular carcinoma, Ewing sarcoma and basal cell carcinoma. All these candidates were successfully validated in preclinical models. The success of this approach relies on multiscale procedures, such as quality control of disease samples, selection of appropriate reference tissues, evaluation of disease signatures, and weighting cell lines. There is a plethora of relevant datasets and analysis modules that are publicly available, yet are isolated in distinct silos, making it tedious to implement this approach in translational research. A centralized informatics system that allows prediction of therapeutics for further experimental validation is thus of great interest to researchers working on understudied diseases. Accordingly, we propose four specific aims: 1) developing novel deep learning methods to select precise reference normal tissues for disease signature creation, 2) developing computational methods to reuse drug profiles from other disease models for drug prediction, 3) integrating open efficacy data to identify new targets from the systems-based approach, and 4) developing a centralized platform and promoting the platform in the scientific community. This proposal will reuse several big open databases (e.g., TCGA, TARGET, GTEx, GEO, LINCS, CTRP, GDSC) and employ cutting-edge informatics methods (e.g., deep learning). To demonstrate the scalability of the system, we will investigate three representative understudied diseases: multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (Aim 1), diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (Aim 2) and hepatocellular carcinoma (Aim 3). Successful implementation of the systems-based approach can be used as a model for using other large open omics (proteins, metabolites) to discover therapeutics for diseases with unmet needs. This proposal will bring together experts in informatics, statistics, computer science, and physicians from Michigan State University, Stanford University, UC Berkeley and Spectrum Health. All data and code will be released to the public for continuing development. The system will be deployed to our OCTAD portal (http://octad.org), an open workplace for therapeutic discovery. Project Narrative About 25 million people are living with understudied diseases in the U.S. Although there are voluminous high dimensional molecular datasets that could be leveraged for research, individual labs have limited computational capacity to translate these molecular features into therapeutic hits. We propose to build a centralized information system that allows individual labs to easily harness open gene expression datasets and generate new therapeutic targets or drug candidates for further experimental validation.",Repurpose open data to discover therapeutics for understudied diseases,9802075,R01GM134307,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Asia', 'Basal Cell', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Cancer cell line', 'Case Study', 'Cell Line', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Modelings', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Evaluation', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Quality Control', 'Ramp', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'System', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Workplace', 'base', 'cancer gene expression', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'disorder control', 'drug candidate', 'drug mechanism', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open data', 'overexpression', 'pill', 'protein metabolite', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,453660,0.031307866087414
"Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to define genes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been cataloged on gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human disease, our understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. To address this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote health, we propose develop mutagenic, revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific, untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. The goals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to make site-specific double strand breaks. First, we propose to develop a suite of vectors to make integration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertible alleles. Second, we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish at TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomology mediated end-joining pathway. Third, leveraging our preliminary data, we propose to improve methods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated alleles in zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth, we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highly mutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promote health following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafish due to their ease of gene delivery, we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance the efficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms and large animals. In our opinion, this will have important implications for modeling human disease and health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles, small nucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease, and conditional alleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health. The central goal for this application is to define genes that can promote or restore human health. For this, we propose to develop efficient integration of highly mutagenic and conditional cassettes into genes in a site-directed manner. The strategies proposed employ the ability of designer nucleases to create DNA double strand breaks and to site-specifically direct biochemical activities to genes of interest. The technologies developed will have important implications for modeling human disease in animal systems.",Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function,9654794,R24OD020166,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Embryo', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene-Modified', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Human', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Operating System', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transgenes', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'gene therapy', 'homologous recombination', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'method development', 'mutant', 'nuclease', 'recombinase', 'repaired', 'site-specific integration', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases', 'vector']",OD,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2019,778412,0.03799614060733296
"Role of Smooth Muscle Calponin in Vascular Pathobiology There is now incontrovertible evidence from sophisticated lineage tracing studies that vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) de-differentiation contributes substantively to a number of vascular diseases. A major manifesta- tion of such phenotypic change is attenuated expression of a battery of VSMC-restricted genes, including the enigmatic smooth muscle calponin (Cnn1) gene. The function of Cnn1 has been studied primarily in vitro or in a single knockout mouse wherein several exons and introns were replaced with a neo cassette which, as detailed below, obfuscates accurate interpretation of phenotypes. We have championed the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system in mice to engineer subtle substitutions within regulatory elements of many genes, leaving intact all coding sequences. We report here a remarkable phenotype wherein a single base change of a single CArG box in the Cnn1 locus abolishes expression of CNN1 in vascular (but not visceral) SMC. Full expression of CNN1 is restored with a BAC carrying human CNN1 or CRISPR-mediated activation of the en- dogenous Cnn1 promoter. Cnn1 CArG mutant mice, representing the first animal models of regulatory element edits, also show elevation in VSMC DNA synthesis and defective contractile competence. Conversely, over- expression of BAC-CNN1 suppresses VSMC growth, antagonizes neointimal formation, reduces VSMC lipid uptake, and enhances contractile gene expression. Interestingly, CNN1-Ser175 appears to be a critical residue for some of these effects making it an attractive amino acid for CRISPR-mediated editing in mice. Additional data support CNN1 as a scaffold for ERK signaling and effector of the immotile state of differentiated VSMC. Importantly, a complete understanding of CNN1 function is complicated by robust expression of two related genes (Cnn2 and Cnn3) in VSMC. We hypothesize that CNN1 functions in concert with other CNN isoforms to maintain a mature VSMC differentiated state. This hypothesis will be tested in three aims using state-of-the-art tools in genetics, animal models of disease, and molecular physiology assays of VSMC function. Aim 1 will exploit the single base edit in Cnn1 as a novel loss-of-function mouse in context of acute and chronic vascular disease models; complementation studies will be carried out in vitro and in vivo to rigorously ascribe pheno- typic changes to the specific loss of CNN1. Aim 2 will exploit a well-characterized BAC mouse to elucidate functions associated with Cnn1 gain-of-function in models of vascular disease used in Aim 1. Complementary CRISPR editing of the BAC mouse, in background of Cnn1 KO, will afford exquisite insight into functional residues that mediate CNN1 function. Aim 3 will exploit new floxed Cnn2 and Cnn3 mice with an exciting VSMC-specific Cre driver we have developed to address, for the first time, triple Cnn KO mouse models at baseline and in acute or chronic vascular disease models. These studies, based on paradigm-shifting approaches to gene KOs, serve as a template for the study of other gene families linked to VSMC differen- tiation and will inform future studies targeting CNN1 in diseases where VSMC differentiation is compromised. Diseases of blood vessels involve radical changes in the normal program of gene expression and function, the underlying nature of which is poorly understood. We have used the revolutionary CRISPR system of genome editing to study a gene called CNN1, which is specific for smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. We will study this gene, along with related genes, in both cells and blood vessels to gain new insights into vascular diseases.",Role of Smooth Muscle Calponin in Vascular Pathobiology,9671549,R01HL136224,"['Actins', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Aneurysm', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Injury', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Cytoskeleton', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Growth', 'Hematological Disease', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Introns', 'Ion Channel', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'LoxP-flanked allele', 'MAPK3 gene', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Serum Response Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'base', 'calponin', 'cell growth', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gain of function', 'gene function', 'genome editing', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'insight', 'knockout gene', 'loss of function', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'myocardin', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'response', 'scaffold', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'uptake', 'vascular smooth muscle cell migration']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2019,602307,0.02299925101297439
"Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen The impact of fungal pathogens on human health is devastating. They infect billions of people worldwide, and kill more than 1.5 million each year. The most vulnerable are people with reduced immune function, such as those with HIV or those undergoing immune suppressing treatments for cancer or organ transplants. One of the most pervasive fungal pathogens is Candida albicans, which kills almost 40% of people suffering from bloodstream infections. Treating these infections is extremely difficult, as fungi are closely related to humans and there are very few drugs that kill the fungus without host toxicity. With the emergence of drug resistance, the development of new therapeutic strategies is now crucial. To address this important clinical need and identify new antifungal drug targets, it is critical to uncover mechanisms that enable C. albicans to cause life-threatening human disease.  We are one of the first academic labs to obtain a powerful resource that will allow us to test the function of almost every gene in the C. albicans genome. This resource includes a collection of double barcoded heterozygous mutants covering ~90% of the genome, and a collection of strains covering ~40% of the genome where the expression of the remaining wild-type allele of a gene is governed by the tetracycline-repressible promoter. This resource provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify genes that control key virulence traits such as morphogenesis. It also enables the identification of determinants of commensalism and virulence, and to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. We have optimized a functional genomics platform for massively parallel analysis of fungal virulence traits using next generation sequencing to quantify the relative proportion of each barcoded strain in pooled assays. We have also optimized high- resolution image analysis of cellular morphology and structures, and assays for identifying genes important for commensalism, virulence, and interaction with host immune cells. Our studies will provide the first global analysis of C. albicans morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence.  Our studies will: 1) develop a computational platform to predict C. albicans essential genes, and expand the collection of tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains to cover most non-essential genes, since genes required for pathogen viability in vitro provide little insight into mechanisms of host adaptation or virulence; 2) identify novel regulators of key virulence traits such as morphogenesis; and 3) identify determinants of C. albicans host adaptation and virulence on a genome scale. This work will provide an expanded functional genomics resource to advance the field, and will leverage this resource to elucidate the genes and genetic networks governing morphogenesis and virulence. This will reveal new strategies to cripple fungal pathogens, and drug targets to improve clinical outcome. The focus of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This eukaryotic pathogen has a profound impact on human health, with a global incidence of Candida bloodstream infections of ~400,000 cases, associated with crude mortality rates of 42% and attributable mortality rates of 27%; C. albicans is the most prevalent Candida species in almost all patient populations. The central hypotheses that govern this proposal are that functional genomic analysis of C. albicans using genome-scale libraries of double barcoded heterozygous gene deletion mutants and tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains will reveal novel circuitry governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence, and that targeting this circuitry has therapeutic potential for combating life-threatening fungal infections.","Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen",9751202,R01AI127375,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Aneuploidy', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Ascomycota', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Candida', 'Candida albicans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Cytolysis', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Essential Genes', 'Filament', 'Foundations', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Library', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Mycoses', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sepsis', 'Solid', 'Symbiosis', 'Systemic infection', 'Testing', 'Tetracyclines', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'attributable mortality', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer transplantation', 'combat', 'computational platform', 'fitness', 'functional genomics', 'fungus', 'gene replacement', 'genome-wide', 'genomic platform', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'mucosal microbiota', 'mutant', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'patient population', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'trait', 'unpublished works']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2019,545099,0.023432077400649582
"Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection. Brains transform sensory information into decisions and decisions into behaviors, which ultimately determine fitness. Behavior can be broken down into a set of discrete chunks of movement, called actions. The basal ganglia (BG) and in particular the input nucleus of the BG, the striatum, is critical for the proper sequencing and selection of actions. At a cellular level, the striatum is comprised of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that constitute the direct pathway (dSPNs) and indirect pathway (iSPNs). Under the center-surround model of action selection, dSPNs are thought to facilitate the expression of an action while iSPNs are thought to inhibit the expression of other actions. However, it is not clear how each pathway contributes to action selection due to methodological constraints in acquiring an objectively quantitative description of behavior. Our lab has recently developed a pipeline, known as MoSeq, that acquires high-resolution behavioral data and uses an unsupervised algorithm to model stereotyped pose dynamics (actions or “syllables”). Here I propose to combine this state-of- the-art behavioral acquisition and detection technology with both cellular-resolution imaging and optogenetic perturbation to study the population dynamics underlying action selection in the striatum. I hypothesize that SPNs exhibit syllable-specific tuning, where dSPNs are tightly tuned to facilitate the expression of related syllables, while iSPNs are more broadly tuned to suppress the simultaneous expression of other syllables. I will dissect these two processes by recording and manipulating each SPN class during specific syllable expression. In aim 1, I will perform cellular-resolution recordings of the direct or indirect pathway using genetically encoded calcium indicators and miniaturized microendoscopy in the striatum. I will examine the differential roles of the direct and indirect pathways in the context of behavioral tuning. My preliminary data suggest that dSPNs are more sparsely tuned than iSPNs. In aim 2, I will functionally test the center-surround model via direct and indirect pathway inhibition. I will use the inhibitory anion-conducting rhodopsin, ACR2. Using a system capable of detecting syllable expression in real-time, I will perturb each pathway triggered upon the expression of specific syllables to compare the same selection context across many trials. In summary, the experiments proposed here will contribute to a mechanistic understanding of how the BG performs action selection on a moment-to-moment timescale. This proposal is the first to test the predictions made by the center- surround model and will advance our understanding of how the BG encodes actions. Behavior is constructed from actions that are placed into sequences that enable animals to achieve ethologically relevant goals. The striatum, the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, is critical for the proper selection and expression of actions.

"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biological pathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network  topology algorithms to identify changes in molecular pathways in preterm and term placentae. These data will  be  combined  with  publically  available  data  to  identify  molecular  pathways  and  genes  within  those  pathways  that differ between term and preterm placentae to provide insight into placental maturity.   Aim 3: Generation of a placenta-­specific transcriptional network for identifying regulatory mechanisms  involved  in  placental  maturity.  We  will  construct  genome-­scale,  tissue  specific  models  of  placental  transcriptional  regulatory  networks  using  our  newly-­developed  Transcriptional  Regulatory  Network  Analysis  (TRENA)  approach,  which  leverages  a  wealth  of

"Redefining mesenchymal stem cells: using their cellular and molecular phenotypes to determine their regenerative and therapeutic properties ABSTRACT Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have broad-based potential in regenerative medicine cell therapies and can be isolated from a variety of different tissues. Though MSCs from different tissues are phenotypically similar, a barrier to their clinical use is the high variability of their trophic and regenerative properties. This variability suggests that inherent differences exist in the molecular machinery guiding MSC properties between different MSC populations, yet, to date, these differences are ill-defined. To this end, we have preliminary evidence that MSC phenotypes correlate to their regenerative outcomes. In this study, we aim to elucidate how the molecular and cellular properties of distinct MSC populations determine their regenerative properties. Our hypothesis is that MSCs from different tissues have different regenerative properties which correlate to specific molecular profiles defined by gene expression and transcriptional activity. To test this hypothesis, the project proposed has three Specific Aims (SAs). In SA1, we will determine how tissue-specificity dictates gene expression and dynamic transcription factor activity of distinct MSCs. SA2 will determine how differences in the cellular and molecular properties of MSCs correlate to MSC phenotype. Finally, in SA3, we will determine how the molecular profiles and cellular activities of MSCs dictate their regenerative properties. Findings of the proposed study will provide novel insights about how the distinct molecular profiles of MSCs dictate their biological and physiological properties. In a therapeutic context, this would enable the development of innovative screening technologies for MSC therapies to identify and enrich for the most appropriate MSC for the specific therapeutic application. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Stem cell therapies are emerging as a new treatment approach to regenerate lost tissues, treat ischemic disorders, and treat chronic inflammatory conditions. Many of these approaches use stem cells from adults which are present in various regions throughout the body. Our research team is working to better understand how and why these adult stem cells behave the way they do so that we can better determine how to use them in different therapies to treat debilitating health conditions.",Redefining mesenchymal stem cells: using their cellular and molecular phenotypes to determine their regenerative and therapeutic properties,9835275,R01DE028657,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Angiogenic Factor', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Bone Tissue', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Pulp', 'Development', 'Disease', 'ENG gene', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gingiva', 'Health', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Muscle', 'Natural regeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Osteogenesis', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Production', 'Property', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tooth structure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'alveolar bone', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical translation', 'healthy volunteer', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular phenotype', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'oral tissue', 'osteogenic', 'population based', 'regenerative', 'regenerative therapy', 'screening', 'self-renewal', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell population', 'stem cell therapy', 'stemness', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,398630,-0.008303085141984329
"Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis Despite major advances in prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), it remains a major cause of deaths worldwide. As ASCVD is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and impact on this unmet residual risk. One such human polymorphism in the ID3 gene (rs11574) was associated with ASCVD in 3 distinct human cohorts. Notably, this SNP significantly attenuates ID3 function and studies in pre-clinical models confirm a critical role for ID3 in atheroprotection. We have previously shown that loss of ID3 inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and promotes VSMC expression of inflammatory factors, processes linked to increase atherosclerosis. In collaboration with Dr. Gary Owens, we have generated a mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and VSMC-specific deletion of ID3 to study ID3-dependent VSMC specific changes during the course of lesion development in the context of the whole animal. We have developed a comprehensive CyTOF panel to identify and quantitate key cellular and intracellular changes in VSMC and other lesional cells in the aorta during the course of atherosclerosis development in these mice. To translate murine findings to humans, we have utilized CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering to knock out ID3 and produce the full allelic series of rs11574 in human cells and validated a reproducible system for differentiation of human inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to VSMC. We will quantify the changes in VSMC phenotype in iPSC-derived VSMC with the full allelic series of rs11574. To further translate murine findings to humans, intravascular ultrasound virtual histology (IVUS-VH) will be measured in human coronary arteries and analyzed with cutting edge image analysis techniques in collaboration with Dr. Milan Sonka at the University of Iowa. As such, our group is uniquely poised to dissect the role of this ASCVD-associated SNP and translate findings to humans. We hypothesize: that loss of ID3 in VSMCs will inhibit VSMC growth and promote a phenotype that exacerbates vessel wall inflammation and atherosclerosis lesion development; that human ID3 encoded by the risk allele aggravates these atherogenic VSMC functions; and that human subjects with the risk allele have larger coronary plaques with increased fatty deposits, necrotic cores and calcification compared to subjects homozygous for the common allele. As atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and further impact on ASCVD morbidity and mortality. Human ID3 gene polymorphism at rs11574 is associated with ASCVD in three unique human cohorts. Preliminary data supports a key role for ID3 in vascular smooth muscle cell biology linked to ASCVD. In the current proposal, we will utilize a novel mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and specific deletion of ID3 to elucidate the role of ID3 in promoting atherogenic VSMCs. We will then utilize CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in human inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived VSMCs to identify the VSMC processes altered by the ID3 gene mutation linked to CVD. Lastly, we will determine if this ID3 gene mutation, alone or in combination with other gene mutations are associated with the amount and type of atherosclerotic plaque in human coronary arteries as measured by intravascular ultrasound virtual histology.

"Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cellular signal transduction system (CSTS) plays a fundamental role in maintaining homeostasis of a cell, and perturbations of CSTS lead to diseases such as cancers and diabetes. Most of cellular signaling pathways eventually regulate gene expression, thus the latter can be used as a universal bioassay reflecting the state of CSTS. However, the gene expression profile from a cell reflects a mixture of responses to all active signaling pathways, thus it is a challenge to de-convolute the signals embedded in the gene expression data. With advent of high throughput biotechnology, major public databases host the results of millions of gene expression assays, collected under diverse diseases as well as the experimental conditions designed by experimental biologists to probe almost all aspects of CSTS. The wealth of these big data provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate CSTS under physiological and pathological conditions, but it also poses unprecedented challenges: how to reveal signals from convoluted data and turn big data into knowledge. We hypothesize that given a sufficiently large compendium of gene expression data collected under diverse conditions, in which different parts of CSTS are perturbed (either by designed experiments or by diseases), the cellular signals embedded in the gene expression data can be revealed and their organization can inferred using current state-of-the-art ""deep learning"" models. In this project, we will compil a comprehensive compendium of human gene expression data and then employ modern deep-learning algorithms and supercomputers to mine the data. We aim to reveal major cellular signals that regulate gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions and to infer the organization of signals in human CSTS. Combined the identified signals with genomic alteration data and drug response data, we aim to further identify pathways underlying disease such as cancers, to use the genomic data to predict drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines, and to predict patient clinical outcomes, in a pathway-centered manner. This project aims to develop and apply novel “deep learning” algorithms to mine a comprehensive compendium of genome-scale data in order to reveal the major signals regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions. This knowledge can be further applied to understand disease mechanisms of cancers and guide personalized treatment of cancer patients.",Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium,9462855,R01LM012011,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Canes', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Encyclopedias', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Statistical Models', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'cancer genome', 'cancer subtypes', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug sensitivity', 'environmental change', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'supercomputer', 'translational medicine', 'translational study']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,327823,0.047558444222969364
"Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity Project Summary Our overarching goal is to understand how information characterizing genes and their function can be organized, integrated, and then generalized to new contexts. This is a central question of the post-genomic era, and one that becomes ever more pressing as novel assays expand the scope, breadth, and detail of information describing gene properties. While the Gene Ontology is the most prominent and universal system for organizing gene function, hundreds of others exist, often serving specialized research interests. Most laboratories depend on the validity of some subset of this data to design new experiments or interpret their results, but their quality is hard to directly ascertain, particularly in novel or complex integrative methodologies. Based on substantial preliminary data, we hypothesize that determining robustness and specificity will provide a highly general assessment of the utility of databases. We propose to use these properties to assess the entire corpus of resources organizing gene information, as well as the methods which exploit this information, and the results that they report. Critically, determining robustness and specificity does not require validation with respect to ‘gold standard’ information. By evaluating these resources with respect to their joint specificity and robustness we determine means of integrating and organizing their data for use in novel applications. Finally, we propose to apply our improvements in quality control to better target rare but robust results where this is an experimental goal, notably rare diseases and single cell expression. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Determine the uniqueness and robustness of data characterizing gene function. We develop a formal approach for characterizing robustness and uniqueness/specificity by exploiting prior probability in the form of gene multifunctionality. We will evaluate robustness and specificity across essentially all complex and structured databases characterizing genes. These measures can be compared between databases or over time and provide a global landscape of data structure. 2. Test methods designed to exploit information describing gene function. Statistical and machine learning methods exploiting structured data will be assessed for robust and specific output. Data features driving performance in diverse applications will be identified and complementary sources of data as well as community clusters will be defined. 3. Evaluate results that depended on the use of databases describing gene function. Using a combination of text-mining and figure-mining, we will assess the ongoing literature for novel, robust, and specific gene-function associations. We will characterize and evaluate the “dark matter” of gene-function association from both the point of unannotated genes as well as incomplete functions. Project Narrative Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene function in many different contexts and this data is captured in numerous resources which catalogue the varied properties of genes. The primary goal of this project is to explore and characterize the specificity and robustness of information about gene function within these databases. Because most biomedical experiments build on pre-existing knowledge, establishing guidelines for interpreting that data also has a large impact on our ability to understand novel results, particularly where they are unusual, as in many rare diseases.",Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity,9566292,R01LM012736,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Information Resources', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'comparative', 'dark matter', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2018,472478,0.04617169323927969
"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9562959,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Pan Genus', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'dark matter', 'drug development', 'fly', 'genetic association', 'genome annotation', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mitochondrial genome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peptide hormone', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'screening', 'terabyte']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2018,1186500,0.001926249469641249
"Addressing Open Challenges of Computational Genome Annotation We propose to capitalize on success of ongoing collaboration between the bioinformatics teams at the University of Greifswald (Germany) and at the Georgia Institute of Technology (USA) and address open challenges in computational genome annotation. In the course of this development, we plan to implement new algorithmic ideas and satisfy the needs of unbiased integration of different types of OMICS data.  We plan to address one of the long-standing problems at interface of bioinformatics and machine learning – automatic generative and discriminative parameterization of gene finding algorithms. Current methods of combining OMICS evidence frequently result in under predicting or over predicting tools. Having good understanding of the difficulties and the properties of different types of OMICS evidence we propose an optimized approach to the full unsupervised, generative and discriminative training.  We will introduce novel means to optimize integration of multiple OMICS evidence into gene prediction. These ideas will develop further the protein family-based gene finding implemented in AUGUSTUS-PPX. We propose to create representations of protein families for gene finding that for the first time include cross-species gene structure information.  We will develop a new approach that will unify two advanced research areas - transcript reconstruction from RNA-Seq and statistical gene finding that integrates RNA-Seq and homology information. We will describe a new, comprehensive model and EM-like algorithmic technique (the “wholistic” approach) to identify the sets of transcripts and their expression levels that best fit the available OMICS evidence.  We will also develop an automatic gene-finding algorithm for a full content of metagenomes including eukaryotic and viral metagenomic sequences. This task is conventionally considered too challenging. We propose a solution exploiting and advancing algorithmic ideas and approaches that we mastered in the course of creating gene finders for prokaryotic metagenomes as well as eukaryotic genomes.  All new tools will be available to the community under open source licenses. The goal of this project is to advance the science of genome interpretation by developing much needed computational methods and tools for high precision annotation of eukaryotic genomes and metagenomes. This advance will make an impact in research on model and non-model organisms including important human pathogens, parasites and viruses. New high throughput technologies generate volumes of sequence data on complex genomes as well as metagenomes. Still these big data volumes have to be transformed into scientific knowledge.

"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome SUMMARY The understudied protein targets that are the focus of the implementation phase of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project need to be placed in the contexts of gene-sets/pathways, drugs/small-molecules, diseases/phenotypes, and cells/tissues. By extending our previous methods, we will impute knowledge about the understudied potential target protein kinases, GPCRs, and ion channels listed in the RFA using machine learning strategies. To establish this classification system, we will organize data from many omics- and literature- based resources into attribute tables where genes are the rows and their attributes are the columns. Examples of such attribute tables include gene or protein expression in cancer cell lines (CCLE) or human tissues (GTEx), changes in expression in response to drug perturbations or single-gene knockdowns (LINCS), regulation by transcription factors based on ChIP-seq data (ENCODE), and phenotypes in mice observed when single genes are knocked out (KOMP). In total, we will process and abstract data from over 100 resources. We will then predict target functions, target association with pathways, small-molecules/drugs that modulate the activity and expression of the target, and target relevance to human disease. To further validate such predictions, we will employ text mining to identify knowledge that corroborates with the data mining predictions, perform molecular docking of predicted small molecules using homology modeling, and seek associations between variants and human diseases by mining electronic medical records (EMR) together with genomic profiling of thousands of patients. In addition, we will develop innovative data visualization tools to allow users to interact with all the collected data, and develop social networking software to build communities centered around proteins/genes/targets as well as biological topics including pathways, cell types, drugs/small-molecules, and diseases. Overall, we will develop an invaluable resource that will accelerate target and drug discovery. NARRATIVE The Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project will facilitate translational research by integrating and mining data about understudied druggable targets from numerous repositories and other resources.

"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9543532,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,400001,0.02814329912831939
"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs. Project Narrative/Health Relevance Advancing understanding of understudied kinases, a highly druggable class of proteins, will increase knowledge about signal transduction and control over cellular physiology and is likely to reveal a subset of proteins that should be advanced as targets for new therapeutic drugs.",Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome,9564894,U24DK116204,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources Management', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'design', 'human disease', 'human model', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knockout gene', 'knowledge base', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phosphoproteomics', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stable isotope', 'structural genomics', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'unsupervised learning']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2018,2270717,0.020283881631169128
"The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes PROJECT SUMMARY - HGNC The core objective of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is to enable effective communication and data exchange between everyone with an interest in human genes, by providing a unique, concise and standardized gene symbol and name for every human gene. As usage of genomic data increases in healthcare the need for a consistent language for genes becomes ever more vital. Aim 1 of this proposal will ensure the continuity of standardized naming of novel human protein-coding genes, long and small non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and pseudogenes. In particular all putative novel protein coding loci will require careful consideration; as active members of the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) consortium, HGNC can ensure that named loci accurately reflect the current expert manual annotations provided by consortium members. Aim 2 concentrates on renaming newly characterized human genes that are currently assigned a placeholder symbol; some genes with a phenotype-based nomenclature will also be considered for reassignment. These updates will reflect functional information, aid name transferal to orthologous genes, and avoid confusion. This round of revision will be a precursor to a nomenclature freeze for the majority of protein coding genes. Aim 3 focusses on coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, collaborating with the six existing vertebrate gene nomenclature committees (mouse, rat, chicken, Anolis, Xenopus, zebrafish) which base their naming on human gene nomenclature. As the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) this effort will be extended to naming genes in vertebrates lacking a nomenclature authority, such as cow, dog and horse. Recent gene naming in chimpanzee enabled creation of the necessary tools, pipelines and databases required for naming in other species. Assignments will reflect homologous relationships to human genes. Aim 4 will investigate the utility of machine learning in automated assignment of systematic nomenclature to long ncRNA genes and vertebrate orthologs, and potentially to pseudogenes. Models will be trained on manually curated datasets to learn both explicit and implicit practices, and then applied at scale. Aim 5 will ensure consistent naming across vertebrates in complex and divergent gene families, which can reveal some of the most interesting evolutionary biology and account for key diversity between species, but require careful manual curation. HGNC will collaborate with experts to expand the successful gene naming in the pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) family to further species, also working across species on two other complex key families involved in detoxification, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). HGNC will also work with experts to expand gene naming of olfactory receptors, the largest vertebrate gene family, from mammals to other well- studied model organisms such as zebrafish, Xenopus and chicken. HGNC is the only group worldwide providing systematic and user-friendly names for genes that are used throughout biomedical science and clinical practice; this is a crucial facility, with increasing importance and direct benefits for public health. To ensure effective communication between basic and clinical researchers, practicing clinicians and patients, there has to be a consistent well managed set of names for all human genes, which HGNC has provided since 1979. Having these names enables new discoveries, avoids confusion and prevents patient harm, by helping to ensure that everyone refers to a given gene using the same name.",The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes,9527894,U24HG003345,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cattle', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ensure', 'Equus caballus', 'Family', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Glucuronosyltransferase', 'Glutathione S-Transferase', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Nomenclature', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pan Genus', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudogenes', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Study models', 'Syntenic Conservation', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'Zebrafish', 'authority', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'duplicate genes', 'gene product', 'genomic data', 'human genomics', 'interest', 'member', 'novel', 'olfactory receptor', 'parallelization', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vertebrate genome', 'web site']",NHGRI,EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY,U24,2018,550000,0.042761935373168955
"Colorectal Cancer Molecular Subtype Assay Development and Validation ABSTRACT Stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) demonstrates substantial variability in tumor biology and clinical outcomes and there is a need to understand prognosis for patients in order to gauge risk benefit for chemotherapy and intensity of chemotherapy administration. These features are not well recapitulated by the current biomarkers in use in the clinic, majority of them are DNA based mutation assays. RNA expression patterns have been described by various investigators and may more fully recapitulate tumor biology. The clinical utility of these findings have been limited by the apparent conflicting subgrouping efforts and lack of a validated gene expression signature as a clinical grade assay applicable on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. In our international collaboration with several academic leaders who have previously published in this field, we have identified a robust consensus subgroup classification based on clustering approaches independent of clinical outcomes. Remarkably, this classification system, termed consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), identified 4 subgroups that provide novel insights into the classification of CRC. One subgroup with mesenchymal, TGF-β, and angiogenic features (CMS4) is associated with a hazard ratio for death of 2.26 (95% CI of 1.41 to 3.61, P=.001), significantly higher than other subgroups, in a multivariate model inclusive of current clinical and pathologic risk factors and genetic signature (Oncotype Dx). We hypothesize that a gene expression signature classifier can be developed and validated for determining the CMS in FFPE tissues, and that this classifier can be implemented to improve prognostication of stage III CRC by classifying them in CMS 4 vs. other subtypes. We have developed a support-vector-machine classifier with very high accuracy for classification based on an Affymetrix array from fresh frozen specimens. We have demonstrated good classification accuracy (>90%) using customized Nanostring codesets on FFPE tumor samples of 85 patients with stage III CRC. We have also demonstrated good technical reproducibility in six of those 85 samples. In this application, we will transfer the assay using the Nanostring Codeset to fresh frozen (FF) and FFPE using a set of paired samples, while maintaining classifier performance. We will then pursue technical and analytic validation of the assay, including precision in repeatability, reproducibility between sample types, inter- lab reproducibility, and impact of RNA quality/quantity. In the UH3 portion of the grant, we will clinically validate the prognostic utility of the gene expression signature assay in single-institution cohort, and then in a completed prospective study of FOLFOX chemotherapy (NRG/NSABPC-08), in a CLIA certified laboratory. Additional data will be used in predicting response to various standard of care therapeutics, which represents a series of future potential applications of the assay. By utilizing an assay developed to classify CRC by its tumor biology, we anticipate development of an enduring tool that will be of greater use than traditional fit-for-purpose tests.   NARRATIVE The molecular characteristics of colon cancer can be described by RNA-based expression, and a consensus classification method has been developed.

"Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme Project Summary/Abstract Background: The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This motivation has led to the development of radiogenomics, the study of the connection between a tumor’s underlying molecular traits and its clinical and imaging phenotypes. Radiogenomic analyses provide an opportunity to identify “imaging surrogates” for inferring gene expression. This is clinically applicable for patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who routinely undergo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, current radiogenomic approaches make strong algorithmic assumptions, and results are potentially biased due to the many different ways that data is preprocessed and selected. The goals of this proposal are to (1) develop new radiogenomic models for identify imaging surrogates, and (2) systematically assess the robustness of radiogenomic findings. Aim 1: To evaluate the application of deep neural networks to discover radiogenomic associations. Aim 2: To compare resultant radiogenomic associations given different model inputs. Aim 3: To determine if the use of radiomic features increases specificity of radiogenomic associations. Methods: In Aim 1, deep neural networks will be trained on public GBM data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (gene expression), and The Cancer Imaging Archive (paired MR images). The model will take high-dimensional gene expression data and predict semantic imaging phenotypes derived from semi-automatically segmented regions-of-interest (ROIs) on MR images. To enable learning of deep networks, the gene expression profile of each patient will be parsed into numerous sparse vectors that encode molecular pathway information. After training, “activation maxi- mization” will extract imaging surrogates from the deep neural network. In Aim 2, a set of common feature selection methods will be applied to the gene expression data. Subsequently, the altered gene data will be the input to deep network to test their ability to derive consistent imaging surrogates. In Aim 3, radiomic features such as histogram and textural features will be extracted from the same ROIs segmented in Aim 1. Instead of semantic imaging phenotypes as the target output, the deep networks will take gene expression data and predict radiomic features. The inferred genes in each imaging surrogate from Aims 1–3 will be annotated with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using several major biological knowledge bases as reference gene sets. Enrichment scores will be normalized, assessed for significance using permutation testing, and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Long-term Objective: The development and systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods will help characterize the extent of overlapping information across biological scales in multimodal cancer patient data. Relevance to Public Health The generation of high-throughput methods in molecular biology and medical imaging has motivated the need to better understand multimodal cancer patient data. This research aims to develop new models to correlate tumor gene expression and its appearance in magnetic resonance images, and to perform a systematic evaluation of radiogenomic methods to study their robustness in identifying meaningful biological mechanisms.",Assessing the Robustness of Radiogenomic Associations using Deep Neural Networks in Glioblastoma Multiforme,9470767,F31CA221061,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Chips', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Radiogenomics', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tweens', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'image archival system', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'vector']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2018,38615,0.04900004696393929
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9547382,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'DNA cassette', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'dietary manipulation', 'drug production', 'fecal microbiota', 'gut microbiota', 'human microbiota', 'humanized mouse', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolomics', 'metatranscriptomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota transplantation', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'solute', 'stool sample', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,634157,0.03680924617648766
"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient. The information we learn may eventually lead to a more personalized approach to the diagnosis and treatment of COPD patients.",INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE,9492745,R01HL125583,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'MicroRNAs', 'Non-Malignant', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spirometry', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Study Subject', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Sample', 'Transcript', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'differential expression', 'disease classification', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease natural history', 'disorder subtype', 'exome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'molecular phenotype', 'molecular subtypes', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'small airways disease', 'study population', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,860223,-0.004291550715833284
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9527869,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2018,472477,0.04863158789155728
"Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species Project Summary To begin unraveling the mysteries of the brain we must first understand its fundamental unit: the neuron. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have resulted in the rapid generation of high dimensional data for individual cells, revealing vast heterogeneity and enabling the prediction of novel cell subtypes based on expression patterns. In spite of this wealth of data, a theoretical framework to define subtype identity is lacking. Cross-laboratory expression analysis has emerged as a powerful approach to obtain robust and replicable results and we have previously shown that scRNA-seq data is readily amenable to gene co-expression meta-analysis. Here, we propose that these methods, in combination with cross-species analysis, will provide important validation of novel subtypes, and allow for the identification of new gene functional modules that drive neuronal diversity. Our overall hypothesis is that coordinated gene expression patterns underlie neuronal identity and function. The specific aims to address this hypothesis combine both computational and experimental approaches. First, we will characterize cell-type specific co-expression using RNA-seq data from bulk tissue and from single cells, defining best practices for network construction and identifying and characterizing gene modules that are unique to single cell data. Second, we will define a data- driven cell type taxonomy for the mouse and human nervous systems, and use this to identify neuronal subtype marker genes for validation with co-in situ hybridization and follow up with gene targeting and further scRNA-seq experiments. Finally, we will elucidate functional pathways that are unique to or conserved across species by comparing mouse and human neuronal subtype co-expression networks, with a particular focus on characterizing the cell type specific connectivity of psychiatric disease genes. These aims are consistent with the National Institute of Mental Health's strategic plan to describe the molecules, cells and neural circuits associated with complex behaviors. As a result, these studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of neuronal diversity and identity, leading to improved understanding of the molecular pathology of brain disorders. Project Narrative It has long been known that there are many different kinds of neurons that are involved in controlling brain activity. However, it is unclear precisely how many different types of neurons exist, and to what degree human neurons resemble those of other animals. In this project we propose that by combining information about the gene activity in both human and mouse neurons we will begin to put together a final `parts list' of the nervous system which we can use to understand brain disorders.",Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species,9513320,F32MH114501,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Strategic Planning', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'molecular pathology', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,F32,2018,51923,0.007856040766072716
"Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to define genes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been cataloged on gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human disease, our understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. To address this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote health, we propose develop mutagenic, revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific, untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. The goals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to make site-specific double strand breaks. First, we propose to develop a suite of vectors to make integration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertible alleles. Second, we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish at TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomology mediated end-joining pathway. Third, leveraging our preliminary data, we propose to improve methods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated alleles in zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth, we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highly mutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promote health following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafish due to their ease of gene delivery, we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance the efficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms and large animals. In our opinion, this will have important implications for modeling human disease and health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles, small nucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease, and conditional alleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health. The central goal for this application is to define genes that can promote or restore human health. For this, we propose to develop efficient integration of highly mutagenic and conditional cassettes into genes in a site-directed manner.

"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biological pathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network  topology algorithms to identify changes in molecular pathways in preterm and term placentae. These data will  be  combined  with  publically  available  data  to  identify  molecular  pathways  and  genes  within  those  pathways  that differ between term and preterm placentae to provide insight into placental maturity.   Aim 3: Generation of a placenta-­specific transcriptional network for identifying regulatory mechanisms  involved  in  placental  maturity.  We  will  construct  genome-­scale,  tissue  specific  models  of  placental  transcriptional  regulatory  networks  using  our  newly-­developed  Transcriptional  Regulatory  Network  Analysis  (TRENA)  approach,  which  leverages  a  wealth  of  information  from  the  NIH’s  ENCODE  project.  We  will  characterize  which  transcriptional  regulators  are  most  likely  responsible  for  perturbed  gene  expression,  their  signaling pathways and downstream targets. Previously unknown or understudied networks or genes identified

"Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular smooth muscle (SMC) phenotypic modulation, the transition from a contractile to a proliferative phenotype accompanied by neointima formation following vascular injury, plays a critical role in the development and progression of several proliferative cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. The regulatory mechanisms underlying SMC phenotypic modulation, however, are poorly understood. A hallmark feature of the phenotypic modulation is the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a well-known stimulator of SMC phenotypic modulation, down- regulates SMC gene expression and stimulates SMC proliferation via posttranscriptional regulation of the related genes. The post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in SMC phenotype gene expression, however, remain largely unknown. Our exciting preliminary data indicate that the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes is caused by abnormal RNA editing of their precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs). This abnormal pre-mRNA editing is facilitated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), which converts adenosines to inosines (A->I editing). A-to-I RNA editing of the pre-mRNA transcripts from introns or 3'-untranslated regions alters pre- mRNA splicing, leading to decreased mature mRNA levels and abnormal cellular functions. PDGF-BB induces ADAR1 while down-regulating SMC myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) and calponin (CNN). Knockdown of ADAR1 by shRNA restores PDGF-BB-blocked SMMHC and CNN expression, demonstrating that ADAR1 plays an essential role in SMC phenotype modulation. ADAR1 appears to be also important for PDGF-BB-induced SMC proliferation/survival. In vivo studies show that SMMHC and CNN pre-mRNA is accumulated when their mature mRNA is decreased in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Moreover, ADAR1 is highly induced in media layer SMCs initially, and neointima SMCs subsequently following the injury. Of importance, knockdown of ADAR1 dramatically inhibits injury-induced neointima formation, demonstrating a critical role of ADAR1 in vascular remodeling in vivo. These seminal findings strongly support a novel hypothesis that ADAR1/abnormal RNA editing mediates PDGF-BB-induced down-regulation of SMC contractile genes and SMC proliferation/survival, leading to SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling. Using primary culture of SMCs, in vivo rat balloon injury and mouse wire injury models combining with molecular, cellular and histological approaches, we will 1) determine the role and mechanism whereby ADAR1 modulates SMC phenotype; 2) elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ADAR1 function in regulating SMC proliferation/survival; and 3) study the role of ADAR1 in SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling in vivo. Successful completion of these aims will unravel a novel mechanism governing SMC phenotypic modulation, which will ultimately lead to identification of novel targets for developing therapeuti agents to treat proliferative vascular diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of mortality in the United States. Transition of vascular smooth muscle (SMC) from a differentiated phenotype to a proliferative state accompanied by neointima formation plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. In this application, a combination of molecular, cellular, and genetic approaches with gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies will be used to establish a novel mechanism underlying SMC phenotypic modulation. The completion of this project will advance our understanding of the fundamental pathologic mechanisms that contribute to the progression of aforementioned proliferative vascular diseases, and most importantly, lead to identification of important novel targets for developing therapeutic agents to treat these diseases.",Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling,9238787,R01HL119053,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'ADAR1', 'Adenosine', 'Angioplasty', 'Ants', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Bite', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Cell physiology', 'Contractile Proteins', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Embryo', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histologic', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypertension', 'Ice', 'Injury', 'Inosine', 'Introns', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lead', 'MYH11 gene', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Myosin Heavy Chains', 'Pathologic', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Proliferation', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Veins', 'adenosine deaminase', 'calponin', 'gain of function', 'genetic approach', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'knock-down', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Precursor', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neointima formation', 'novel', 'platelet-derived growth factor BB', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'restenosis', 'small hairpin RNA', 'teration']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2018,375000,-0.025903646576158366
"Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen The impact of fungal pathogens on human health is devastating. They infect billions of people worldwide, and kill more than 1.5 million each year. The most vulnerable are people with reduced immune function, such as those with HIV or those undergoing immune suppressing treatments for cancer or organ transplants. One of the most pervasive fungal pathogens is Candida albicans, which kills almost 40% of people suffering from bloodstream infections. Treating these infections is extremely difficult, as fungi are closely related to humans and there are very few drugs that kill the fungus without host toxicity. With the emergence of drug resistance, the development of new therapeutic strategies is now crucial. To address this important clinical need and identify new antifungal drug targets, it is critical to uncover mechanisms that enable C. albicans to cause life-threatening human disease.  We are one of the first academic labs to obtain a powerful resource that will allow us to test the function of almost every gene in the C. albicans genome. This resource includes a collection of double barcoded heterozygous mutants covering ~90% of the genome, and a collection of strains covering ~40% of the genome where the expression of the remaining wild-type allele of a gene is governed by the tetracycline-repressible promoter. This resource provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify genes that control key virulence traits such as morphogenesis. It also enables the identification of determinants of commensalism and virulence, and to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. We have optimized a functional genomics platform for massively parallel analysis of fungal virulence traits using next generation sequencing to quantify the relative proportion of each barcoded strain in pooled assays. We have also optimized high- resolution image analysis of cellular morphology and structures, and assays for identifying genes important for commensalism, virulence, and interaction with host immune cells. Our studies will provide the first global analysis of C. albicans morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence.  Our studies will: 1) develop a computational platform to predict C. albicans essential genes, and expand the collection of tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains to cover most non-essential genes, since genes required for pathogen viability in vitro provide little insight into mechanisms of host adaptation or virulence; 2) identify novel regulators of key virulence traits such as morphogenesis; and 3) identify determinants of C. albicans host adaptation and virulence on a genome scale. This work will provide an expanded functional genomics resource to advance the field, and will leverage this resource to elucidate the genes and genetic networks governing morphogenesis and virulence. This will reveal new strategies to cripple fungal pathogens, and drug targets to improve clinical outcome. The focus of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This eukaryotic pathogen has a profound impact on human health, with a global incidence of Candida bloodstream infections of ~400,000 cases, associated with crude mortality rates of 42% and attributable mortality rates of 27%; C. albicans is the most prevalent Candida species in almost all patient populations. The central hypotheses that govern this proposal are that functional genomic analysis of C. albicans using genome-scale libraries of double barcoded heterozygous gene deletion mutants and tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains will reveal novel circuitry governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence, and that targeting this circuitry has therapeutic potential for combating life-threatening fungal infections.","Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen",9536694,R01AI127375,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Aneuploidy', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Ascomycota', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Candida', 'Candida albicans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Cytolysis', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Essential Genes', 'Filament', 'Foundations', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Library', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Mycoses', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sepsis', 'Solid', 'Symbiosis', 'Systemic infection', 'Testing', 'Tetracyclines', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'attributable mortality', 'cancer therapy', 'combat', 'fitness', 'functional genomics', 'fungus', 'gene replacement', 'genome-wide', 'genomic platform', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'trait', 'unpublished works']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2018,570554,0.023432077400649582
"Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML No abstract available PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the bone marrow, where immature cells accumulate and disrupt the production of normal blood cells, disrupting normal blood formation and organ function. Despite advances in research, AML patients are typically treated with chemotherapy agents that often fail to cure them and frequently lead to relapse. We propose to create new therapies for repressing AML based on targeting the epigenome, or the pattern of chemical modification of DNA and histones, the proteins that package and order DNA to promote gene expression.",Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML,9681931,F31CA228331,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affinity', 'Apoptosis', 'Arginine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Modification Process', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Docking', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Synergism', 'Embryonic Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Histones', 'Hybrids', 'In Vitro', 'In complete remission', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Bone Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Myelogenous', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Network-based', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Production', 'Protein Methyltransferases', 'Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Series', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'actionable mutation', 'analog', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1', 'design', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'patient response', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,F31,2018,49524,-0.02642773234524031
"Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving randomized left-right patterning of visceral organs, is frequently associated with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), a reflection of the importance of left-right patterning in formation of asymmetries in the four-chamber heart. Heterotaxy (HTX) patients have unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. This may reflect the common requirement for motile cilia, both in embryonic left-right patterning and also mucus clearance in the airway. We recently showed 42% of HTX patients with CHD (HTX/CHD) have airway ciliary dysfunction (CD) similar to that of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a recessive disorder associated with laterality defects and sinopulmonary disease due to mucus clearance defects caused by immotile/dyskinetic cilia in the airway. Significantly, exome sequencing showed HTX patients with CD (HTX/CD) are enriched for novel/rare coding variants (RCV) in genes known to cause PCD and other cilia related genes. In this application, we will functionally assay 53 cilia candidate genes identified in 39 HTX/CD patients by exome sequencing analysis. We will assess the effects of gene knockdown on airway cilia motility using a novel assay with reciliating human airway epithelial cells. To assay gene function required for left-right patternin, antisense MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos will be carried out to examine heart and gut looping. Genes shown to disrupt airway cilia motility and cause HTX after knockdown will be further tested to determine whether the RCVs are pathogenic. Specifically we will examine whether expression of the RCV can rescue the HTX phenotype elicited by MO gene knockdown in the zebrafish embryo. Given all of the RCVs identified in HTX/CD patients were heterozygous, we hypothesize a multigenic model of disease, which will be tested by examining the phenotypes of double heterozygous mouse and zebrafish mutants with two-gene combinations observed in the HTX-CD patients. We will examine for evidence of digenic interactions by assaying motile cilia function and visceral organ situs in the double heterozygous mutants. These experiments will interrogate 8 digenic combinations that make use of 9 novel mouse mutants recovered from our ongoing mouse mutagenesis screen, and 7 other digenic combinations in zebrafish using existing mutant lines and de novo production of 4 zebrafish knockout lines by TALENs gene disruption. Finally, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation in ciliary motion defects, we will develop software for quantitative classification of ciliary motin defects using a computational approach with computer vision and machine learning algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Using this software, we will determine whether different RCVs are associated with different ciliary motion defects. This will provide insights into structure-functio relationships in the regulation of cilia motility. This software, to be made available as an online tool, will have translational potential for clinical evaluation of patient airway ciliary motion daa. Together, these studies will establish functional assays and software that can elucidate the genetic etiology of CHD/HTX. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heterodoxy, a birth defect involving abnormal left-right patterning, have some of the most complex congenital heart defects. Such patients exhibit unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. As motile cilia function is required both for airway mucus clearance and embryonic left-right patterning, we will develop functional assays and software to assess cilia candidate genes containing rare coding variants identified in heterodoxy patients for their role in airway cilia motility and left-right patterning of organ asymmetries.",Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning,9341016,R01GM104412,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cilia', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Embryo', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Frequency', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Handedness', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Knock-out', 'Left', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Situs Inversus', 'Structure', 'Structure of respiratory epithelium', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'Visceral', 'Visual Pattern Recognition', 'With laterality', 'Zebrafish', 'airway epithelium', 'cilium motility', 'congenital heart disorder', 'disease phenotype', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'founder mutation', 'gene function', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research clinical testing', 'respiratory', 'software development', 'structural heart disease', 'tool', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,546200,0.0213825657761018
"Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Time to onset of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is expected to be influenced by multiple gene-gene interactions that add to the complexity of the genotype-phenotype mapping relationship. Unfortunately, parametric statistical methods such as Cox regression lack sufficient power to detect high-order gene-gene interactions due to the sparseness of the data. Machine learning methods offer a more powerful alternative but rely on computationally-intensive searching methods to identify the top models. We propose here to develop a powerful and computationally efficient bioinformatics strategy that combines machine learning algorithm and Cox regression for identifying gene-gene and gene-environment interaction models that are associated with time of onset of chronic disease. Specifically, we firs propose to develop a novel Robust Survival Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction method (RS-MDR) for the detection of gene-gene interactions in rare variants that influence time of onset of human disease (AIM 1). The power of RS-MDR method will be evaluated by comparing it to other existing methods in simulation studies. We then propose to change the representation space of the gene-gene interaction models using RS-MDR's construction induction method and apply L1 penalized Cox regression to identify a set of interaction models that can predict patients' survival probability (AIM 2). We hypothesize that RS-MDR can effectively identify high order interaction models and the combined approach provides a powerful and computational efficient way to select a set of interaction models. We will use extensive simulations that are derived from GWAS studies to thoroughly evaluate this hypothesis. Next, we will apply the new combined method for detecting and characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from large population-based studies of lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (AIM 3). Results from the real data analysis will be used to refine the method. Finally, we will distribute the proposed method as part of an open- source R software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the proposed method will combine the strength from both parametric and non-parametric methods and enable detection of interaction models that are jointly affecting time of onset of chronic diseases. This is important because time of onset has more variation than case-control status and it may be more clinically relevant. Furthermore, studies of genetic factors predicting time of onset have not been pursued aggressively using GWAS studies, despite the relevance of this information for the discovery of high risk variants like mutations in BRCA1. Narrative This project will provide a general method for genome data analysis that can be potentially apply to any specific disease. We focus the application of this method on an investigation into the role of genetic polymorphisms in lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. This will increase our knowledge of the basic biology and lead for screening and targeted therapy.",Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction,9306198,R01LM012012,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Europe', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'North America', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'Variant', 'base', 'case control', 'clinically relevant', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'simulation', 'survival outcome', 'targeted treatment']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2017,352350,0.01813938342862109
"Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity Project Summary Our overarching goal is to understand how information characterizing genes and their function can be organized, integrated, and then generalized to new contexts. This is a central question of the post-genomic era, and one that becomes ever more pressing as novel assays expand the scope, breadth, and detail of information describing gene properties. While the Gene Ontology is the most prominent and universal system for organizing gene function, hundreds of others exist, often serving specialized research interests. Most laboratories depend on the validity of some subset of this data to design new experiments or interpret their results, but their quality is hard to directly ascertain, particularly in novel or complex integrative methodologies. Based on substantial preliminary data, we hypothesize that determining robustness and specificity will provide a highly general assessment of the utility of databases. We propose to use these properties to assess the entire corpus of resources organizing gene information, as well as the methods which exploit this information, and the results that they report. Critically, determining robustness and specificity does not require validation with respect to ‘gold standard’ information. By evaluating these resources with respect to their joint specificity and robustness we determine means of integrating and organizing their data for use in novel applications. Finally, we propose to apply our improvements in quality control to better target rare but robust results where this is an experimental goal, notably rare diseases and single cell expression. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Determine the uniqueness and robustness of data characterizing gene function. We develop a formal approach for characterizing robustness and uniqueness/specificity by exploiting prior probability in the form of gene multifunctionality. We will evaluate robustness and specificity across essentially all complex and structured databases characterizing genes. These measures can be compared between databases or over time and provide a global landscape of data structure. 2. Test methods designed to exploit information describing gene function. Statistical and machine learning methods exploiting structured data will be assessed for robust and specific output. Data features driving performance in diverse applications will be identified and complementary sources of data as well as community clusters will be defined. 3. Evaluate results that depended on the use of databases describing gene function. Using a combination of text-mining and figure-mining, we will assess the ongoing literature for novel, robust, and specific gene-function associations. We will characterize and evaluate the “dark matter” of gene-function association from both the point of unannotated genes as well as incomplete functions. Project Narrative Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene function in many different contexts and this data is captured in numerous resources which catalogue the varied properties of genes. The primary goal of this project is to explore and characterize the specificity and robustness of information about gene function within these databases. Because most biomedical experiments build on pre-existing knowledge, establishing guidelines for interpreting that data also has a large impact on our ability to understand novel results, particularly where they are unusual, as in many rare diseases.",Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity,9425727,R01LM012736,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Information Resources', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'comparative', 'dark matter', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2017,464956,0.04617169323927969
"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9344966,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Pan Genus', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'dark matter', 'drug development', 'fly', 'genetic association', 'genome annotation', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mitochondrial genome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peptide hormone', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'screening', 'terabyte']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2017,1186500,0.001926249469641249
"Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cellular signal transduction system (CSTS) plays a fundamental role in maintaining homeostasis of a cell, and perturbations of CSTS lead to diseases such as cancers and diabetes. Most of cellular signaling pathways eventually regulate gene expression, thus the latter can be used as a universal bioassay reflecting the state of CSTS. However, the gene expression profile from a cell reflects a mixture of responses to all active signaling pathways, thus it is a challenge to de-convolute the signals embedded in the gene expression data. With advent of high throughput biotechnology, major public databases host the results of millions of gene expression assays, collected under diverse diseases as well as the experimental conditions designed by experimental biologists to probe almost all aspects of CSTS. The wealth of these big data provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate CSTS under physiological and pathological conditions, but it also poses unprecedented challenges: how to reveal signals from convoluted data and turn big data into knowledge. We hypothesize that given a sufficiently large compendium of gene expression data collected under diverse conditions, in which different parts of CSTS are perturbed (either by designed experiments or by diseases), the cellular signals embedded in the gene expression data can be revealed and their organization can inferred using current state-of-the-art ""deep learning"" models. In this project, we will compil a comprehensive compendium of human gene expression data and then employ modern deep-learning algorithms and supercomputers to mine the data. We aim to reveal major cellular signals that regulate gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions and to infer the organization of signals in human CSTS. Combined the identified signals with genomic alteration data and drug response data, we aim to further identify pathways underlying disease such as cancers, to use the genomic data to predict drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines, and to predict patient clinical outcomes, in a pathway-centered manner. This project aims to develop and apply novel “deep learning” algorithms to mine a comprehensive compendium of genome-scale data in order to reveal the major signals regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions. This knowledge can be further applied to understand disease mechanisms of cancers and guide personalized treatment of cancer patients.",Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium,9251894,R01LM012011,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alpha Cell', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Canes', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Encyclopedias', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'cancer genome', 'cancer subtypes', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'drug sensitivity', 'environmental change', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'supercomputer', 'translational medicine', 'translational study']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,328031,0.047558444222969364
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9353372,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'DNA cassette', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'dietary manipulation', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'humanized mouse', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota transplantation', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,650808,0.03680924617648766
"Separating Wheat from Chaff in Major Depression Blood Biomarker Studies Project Summary Blood expression profiling of major depression disorder (MDD) patients has the potential to refine disease classification and diagnosis, elucidate molecular mechanisms, and improve drug targeting and clinical trial outcomes. However, the only significant finding in the largest MDD blood RNA study, a recent RNAseq profiling of 922 individuals comparing MDD patients with healthy controls, was a composite increase in the expression of genes associated with the interferon response pathway in MDD. Statistical analysis of such datasets is complicated by disease heterogeneity and by sources of inter-individual gene expression variation, such as high person-to-person differences in human blood cell type proportions, making it difficult to find measurements that robustly distinguish clinical groups. We have recently developed latent variable based computational approaches that more effectively model heterogeneity including blood proportions in blood gene expression data and that improve the identification of disease associated differentially expressed genes and disease-associated differences in cell type proportions. We have demonstrated that our methods increase the power to detect differentially expressed genes and improve agreement among separate studies of disease-associated global RNA expression. The latent variable framework we use can be exploited for interpreting the observed changes by attributing them to specific blood cell types. Preliminary analysis using these approaches on the large recent MDD RNAseq dataset finds evidence for additional depression related signatures and differentially expressed RNAs not detected by the original analysis. Analysis of the association of these signatures with acute symptoms and their stability over time in individuals suggests that they are most likely novel MDD trait markers. We will apply this enhanced methodology to identify novel MDD-associated genes in this large RNAseq dataset, confirm these signatures by analysis of other MDD public datasets, investigate the state/trait and genetic basis for these signatures and use machine learning to generate a purely clinical and biological data-driven classification of depression subgroups. This study is expected to result in an improved analysis framework for blood RNA biomarkers studies of psychiatric disease, significant new insight into MDD associated cell type proportion and blood gene expression trait signatures, and the identification of molecularly coherent depression subgroups. Project Narrative We have developed new computational methods that improve the ability to identify blood gene expression changes in genome-wide studies of blood in MDD. We will apply enhanced versions of these methods to investigate public MDD datasets.

"Predicting gene regulation across populations to understand mechanisms underlying complex traits Project Summary A better understanding of the degree of transferability of genetic association results and implicated genes across populations has implications for precision medicine and can only be accomplished by studying the genetic architecture of complex traits in diverse populations. For many complex traits, gene regulation is likely to play a crucial mechanistic role given the consistent enrichment of regulatory variants among trait-associated variants. We have developed a gene-level association method called PrediXcan that harnesses the regulatory knowledge generated by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies to directly test for genes associated with complex traits. An advantage of this gene-based approach over other aggregate variant approaches is that the results are inherently mechanistic and provide directionality, guiding follow-up experiments and future drug development. The genetic contribution to population phenotypic differentiation is driven by differences in causal allele frequencies, effect sizes, and genetic architectures. We propose to broaden the scope of PrediXcan to include diverse populations by (1) optimizing predictors of gene expression within and across diverse populations in multiple tissues and (2) performing gene-level association studies and quantifying regulability on a range of phenotypes in non-European populations. We will use machine learning to optimize predictive models of gene expression in datasets with both genome-wide genotype and gene expression data. We will integrate prior results from larger European populations when appropriate. Based on preliminary results, we expect a range of predictive power (assessed by cross-validation R2) will be observed across genes dependent on the heritability of each gene expression trait and differences in allele frequencies and effect sizes among populations. We will compare populations by 1) calculating the correlation between heritability estimates and cross-validated prediction performance and by 2) by calculating trans-population genetic effect size correlations (allele frequency independent) and trans-population genetic impact correlations (allele frequency dependent). The optimal models will also inform the underlying genetic architectures (sparse vs. polygenic) of gene expression traits and how they vary across populations. As we have done for European populations, the predictive models and heritability estimates developed here will be added to an open access database for use in PrediXcan and other studies. We hypothesize that PrediXcan will increase power to identify genes and implicate mechanisms underlying complex traits and that we can quantify the overall effect of phenotypic variation explained by transcriptome regulation within and across populations. We will compare gene-level results across populations to determine if the same and/or unique genes and pathways are implicated for a particular phenotype. We will estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance explained collectively by all gene expression levels, which we name the regulability of a trait. All results, scripts, and software will be available in publicly accessible databases and repositories. Project Narrative Differences in DNA sequence among individuals can lead to differences in gene expression levels, which in turn can lead to trait differences. We have developed a method that harnesses these DNA differences to predict gene expression levels, which are then tested for correlation with a disease or other trait of interest. Our project will lead to a better understanding of the degree of transferability of genetic association results and implicated genes across populations, which has the potential to improve the implementation of precision medicine among diverse populations and reduce health disparities.",Predicting gene regulation across populations to understand mechanisms underlying complex traits,9304684,R15HG009569,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological', 'Cholesterol', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'European', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Height', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'data access', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'interest', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'trait', 'transcriptome']",NHGRI,LOYOLA UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R15,2017,429000,0.026162041021155876
"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9459529,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,400000,0.02814329912831939
"Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although investments in genomic studies of mental disorders enabled the discovery of thousands of robustly associated variants with these complex diseases, the translation of these discoveries into actionable targets has been hampered by the lack of a mechanistic understanding on how genome variation relates to phenotype. Moreover, it has been widely shown that a substantial portion of the genetic control of complex traits, including mental disorders, is exerted through the regulation of gene expression. However, effective methods to fully harness this mechanism are lagging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel gene-based test -PrediXcan- that directly tests this regulatory mechanism and substantially improves power relative to single variant tests and other gene-based tests. PrediXcan is inherently mechanistic and provides directionality, highlighting its potential utility in identifying novel targets for therapy. The method consists of predicting the whole genome effect on expression traits and correlating this effect with disease risk to identify novel disease genes. In addition, we propose novel approaches to investigate the context-specificity of expression traits (Orthogonal Tissue Decomposition) and to quantify the collective effect of the regulated transcriptome on phenotypes of interest (Regulability). Regulability is similar to the concept of chip heritability (total variability explained collectivey by genotyped variants). First, we will develop cross-tissue, tissue-specific (for over 30 different human tissue types), and brain-region specific expression traits. We will use statistical machine learning methods to develop whole genome prediction models for these traits and extend this work to other molecular phenotypes. All models will be stored in open access databases. Next, we will apply the PrediXcan method to 7 mental disorder phenotypes. More specifically, we will compute genetically predicted levels of gene expression traits and correlate them with disease risk to identify genes involved in disease pathways. We will also quantify the collective effect of the predicted transcriptome (regulability) on mental disorder risk across multiple tissues. Finally we will extend PrediXcan method and develop a method to infer the results of PrediXcan using summary statistics data as opposed to individual level data. This will extend the applicability of the approach to all summary results generated by meta-analysis consortia and increase the power to discover novel genes given the larger sample sizes. The research we propose is driven by an extensive set of preliminary studies, and promises substantial deliverables in both new methods of analysis and public access results databases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large investments in genome studies have been made to understand the consequences of genetic variation on human traits. These have yielded many genetic variants reproducibly associated with disease but the underlying biology is still unclear. We propose a novel computational method that links mechanistically the genetic variability to disease risk and apply it to a range of mental disorder studies to provide more biological insights and enable discovery of potential targets for drug development.","Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect",9301667,R01MH107666,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Architecture', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain region', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Targeting', 'Etiology', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'disorder risk', 'drug development', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'molecular phenotype', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phenotypic data', 'public health relevance', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'user friendly software', 'web app', 'whole genome']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2017,430578,0.002007314703019695
"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient.

"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs. Project Narrative/Health Relevance Advancing understanding of understudied kinases, a highly druggable class of proteins, will increase knowledge about signal transduction and control over cellular physiology and is likely to reveal a subset of proteins that should be advanced as targets for new therapeutic drugs.",Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome,9453342,U24DK116204,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources Management', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'design', 'drug development', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knockout gene', 'knowledge base', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phosphoproteomics', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stable isotope', 'structural genomics', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2017,2308193,0.020283881631169128
"Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species Project Summary To begin unraveling the mysteries of the brain we must first understand its fundamental unit: the neuron. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have resulted in the rapid generation of high dimensional data for individual cells, revealing vast heterogeneity and enabling the prediction of novel cell subtypes based on expression patterns. In spite of this wealth of data, a theoretical framework to define subtype identity is lacking. Cross-laboratory expression analysis has emerged as a powerful approach to obtain robust and replicable results and we have previously shown that scRNA-seq data is readily amenable to gene co-expression meta-analysis. Here, we propose that these methods, in combination with cross-species analysis, will provide important validation of novel subtypes, and allow for the identification of new gene functional modules that drive neuronal diversity. Our overall hypothesis is that coordinated gene expression patterns underlie neuronal identity and function. The specific aims to address this hypothesis combine both computational and experimental approaches. First, we will characterize cell-type specific co-expression using RNA-seq data from bulk tissue and from single cells, defining best practices for network construction and identifying and characterizing gene modules that are unique to single cell data. Second, we will define a data- driven cell type taxonomy for the mouse and human nervous systems, and use this to identify neuronal subtype marker genes for validation with co-in situ hybridization and follow up with gene targeting and further scRNA-seq experiments. Finally, we will elucidate functional pathways that are unique to or conserved across species by comparing mouse and human neuronal subtype co-expression networks, with a particular focus on characterizing the cell type specific connectivity of psychiatric disease genes. These aims are consistent with the National Institute of Mental Health's strategic plan to describe the molecules, cells and neural circuits associated with complex behaviors. As a result, these studies will have a significant impact on our understanding of neuronal diversity and identity, leading to improved understanding of the molecular pathology of brain disorders. Project Narrative It has long been known that there are many different kinds of neurons that are involved in controlling brain activity. However, it is unclear precisely how many different types of neurons exist, and to what degree human neurons resemble those of other animals. In this project we propose that by combining information about the gene activity in both human and mouse neurons we will begin to put together a final `parts list' of the nervous system which we can use to understand brain disorders.",Meta-analysis to define neuronal diversity: from genes to functions across species,9395464,F32MH114501,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Strategic Planning', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'molecular pathology', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'skills', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,F32,2017,59166,0.007856040766072716
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identifynovelcellsubtypesthroughchangesintheexpressionrelationshipsbetweengenes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expressionprofilesislikelytobenefitfromavarietyofapproaches.Inordertofindagreementbetweenthose approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9398289,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2017,472477,0.04292900201349539
"Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to define genes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been cataloged on gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human disease, our understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. To address this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote health, we propose develop mutagenic, revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific, untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. The goals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to make site-specific double strand breaks. First, we propose to develop a suite of vectors to make integration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertible alleles. Second, we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish at TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomology mediated end-joining pathway. Third, leveraging our preliminary data, we propose to improve methods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated alleles in zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth, we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highly mutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promote health following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafish due to their ease of gene delivery, we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance the efficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms and large animals. In our opinion, this will have important implications for modeling human disease and health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles, small nucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease, and conditional alleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health. The central goal for this application is to define genes that can promote or restore human health. For this, we propose to develop efficient integration of highly mutagenic and conditional cassettes into genes in a site-directed manner. The strategies proposed employ the ability of designer nucleases to create DNA double strand breaks and to site-specifically direct biochemical activities to genes of interest. The technologies developed will have important implications for modeling human disease in animal systems.",Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function,9276155,R24OD020166,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Embryo', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene-Modified', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Operating System', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Site', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transgenes', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'gene therapy', 'homologous recombination', 'human disease', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'interest', 'method development', 'mutant', 'nuclease', 'recombinase', 'repaired', 'site-specific integration', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases', 'vector']",OD,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2017,706555,0.03799614060733296
"Harnessing ""omics"": A Systems Biology approach to discovery of biological pathways in placental development and parturition PROJECT SUMMARY  Our  goal  in  this  proposal  is  to  identify  biological  networks  involved  in  synchronizing  placental  growth  and  maturity. To accomplish this goal, we have established a collaborative effort between the Center for Prevention  of  Preterm  Birth  at  Cincinnati  Children’s  Hospital  Medical  Center  (CCHMC)  and  the  Institute  for  Systems  Biology (ISB) in Seattle to conduct a systems level analysis of “omics” data. Perturbed growth and maturity can  lead  to  placental  insufficiency,  which  underlies  a  significant  proportion  of  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes,  such  as preterm birth.  A paucity of knowledge regarding normal placental development and maturity greatly hinders  any  study  of  placental  insufficiency.  Placental  growth  and  development  occurs  throughout  gestation  and  reaches maturity at term. Therefore, it is critical to identify the networks involved and to assess them over the  length of gestation. Our central hypothesis is that key biological networks vital to placental growth and  maturity  can  be  identified  through  the  intersection  of  transcriptomic,  proteomic,  and  metabolomics  data  from  term  and  preterm  placentae.  Furthermore,  utilizing  longitudinal  proteomics  and  metabolomics  data,  we  can  determine  how  those  pathways  change  over  gestation  and  differ  between  normal  and  preterm  placentae. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:   Aim  1:  Identification  of  key  gene  and  metabolite  signatures  involved  in  placental  development  by  analyzing  longitudinal  “omics”  data.  Using  publically  available  transcriptomic  data,  we  will  generate  a  molecular profile of expressed genes in placental development throughout gestation.  We will also determine  the  placental  secretome  and  identify  biomarker  signatures  that  appear  in  maternal  urine  that  reflect  placental  maturation.   Aim  2:  Identification  of  molecular  pathways  associated  with  placental  maturity.  We  will  utilize  network  topology algorithms to identify changes in molecular pathways in preterm and term placentae. These data will  be  combined  with  publically  available  data  to  identify  molecular  pathways  and  genes  within  those  pathways  that differ between term and preterm placentae to provide insight into placental maturity.   Aim 3: Generation of a placenta-­specific transcriptional network for identifying regulatory mechanisms  involved  in  placental  maturity.  We  will  construct  genome-­scale,  tissue  specific  models  of  placental  transcriptional  regulatory  networks  using  our  newly-­developed  Transcriptional  Regulatory  Network  Analysis  (TRENA)  approach,  which  leverages  a  wealth  of  information  from  the  NIH’s  ENCODE  project.  We  will  characterize  which  transcriptional  regulators  are  most  likely  responsible  for  perturbed  gene  expression,  their  signaling pathways and downstream targets. Previously unknown or understudied networks or genes identified

"Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures Project Summary/Abstract  The placenta is an essential organ in human development, and disruption of its function can result in problems in pregnancy including miscarriage, preterm labor, preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Additionally, disrupted placenta function during pregnancy has been associated with a great number of disorders and diseases that do not present until much later in the offspring's life such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, developmental delay and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. How the exposures encountered in the environment drive alterations in placenta structure and function is poorly understood, and placenta function is difficult to assess in vivo using noninvasive methods. We propose to understand how gene expression is altered in the placenta during gestation by noninvasively characterizing the placenta transcriptome in association with exposure to chemicals known to alter endocrine signaling. These chemicals, called phthalates, are commonly found in a variety of commercial products such as plastics and personal care products, and phthalate exposure has also been shown to effect neurodevelopment. The link between phthalate exposure and placenta gene expression in vivo is not yet clear; therefore we have assembled a team comprised of neuroscientists, placenta biologists, environmental epidemiologists, and genomics experts do address how phthalate exposure and gestational age effects gene that are expressed in the placenta but not in other tissues. One of the advantages of the proposed research is that we will assess placenta gene expression noninvasively through RNA molecules contained in extracellular vesicles that are secreted into the urine of pregnant women. Collecting gene expression data and chemical exposure data from urine is highly clinically relevant, and we expect our approach will have clear translational applications just as home pregnancy tests that rely on the detection of placenta produced hormones in urine have become common. Our proposed study will provide the basic science background for the development of rapid, noninvasive tests for assessing placenta function, chemical exposures, and ultimately problems in neurodevelopment and other danger signals during pregnancy. Project Narrative  The proposed research will collect genome wide placenta gene expression data from 50 pregnant women at three time points during gestation. In addition to assessing gene expression differences the proposed research will develop methods to noninvasively determine placenta-originating transcripts among all transcripts existing in the urine of pregnant women. The proposed research will also compare gene expression to endocrine disrupting chemicals known to cause health problems.",Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures,9341310,R21ES027878,"['Address', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Circulation', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin', 'Collection', 'Conceptus', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Illinois', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Placenta', 'Placental Biology', 'Placentation', 'Plasticizers', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Tests', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Procedures', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Stromal Cells', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Syncytiotrophoblast', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Urine', 'Uterine cavity', 'Villous', 'age effect', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytotrophoblast', 'design', 'developmental toxicology', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome-wide', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal morbidity', 'personal care products', 'phthalates', 'postnatal', 'prospective', 'response', 'study population', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2017,191131,0.050223775362451
"Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen The impact of fungal pathogens on human health is devastating. They infect billions of people worldwide, and kill more than 1.5 million each year. The most vulnerable are people with reduced immune function, such as those with HIV or those undergoing immune suppressing treatments for cancer or organ transplants. One of the most pervasive fungal pathogens is Candida albicans, which kills almost 40% of people suffering from bloodstream infections. Treating these infections is extremely difficult, as fungi are closely related to humans and there are very few drugs that kill the fungus without host toxicity. With the emergence of drug resistance, the development of new therapeutic strategies is now crucial. To address this important clinical need and identify new antifungal drug targets, it is critical to uncover mechanisms that enable C. albicans to cause life-threatening human disease.  We are one of the first academic labs to obtain a powerful resource that will allow us to test the function of almost every gene in the C. albicans genome. This resource includes a collection of double barcoded heterozygous mutants covering ~90% of the genome, and a collection of strains covering ~40% of the genome where the expression of the remaining wild-type allele of a gene is governed by the tetracycline-repressible promoter. This resource provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify genes that control key virulence traits such as morphogenesis. It also enables the identification of determinants of commensalism and virulence, and to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. We have optimized a functional genomics platform for massively parallel analysis of fungal virulence traits using next generation sequencing to quantify the relative proportion of each barcoded strain in pooled assays. We have also optimized high- resolution image analysis of cellular morphology and structures, and assays for identifying genes important for commensalism, virulence, and interaction with host immune cells. Our studies will provide the first global analysis of C. albicans morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence.  Our studies will: 1) develop a computational platform to predict C. albicans essential genes, and expand the collection of tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains to cover most non-essential genes, since genes required for pathogen viability in vitro provide little insight into mechanisms of host adaptation or virulence; 2) identify novel regulators of key virulence traits such as morphogenesis; and 3) identify determinants of C. albicans host adaptation and virulence on a genome scale. This work will provide an expanded functional genomics resource to advance the field, and will leverage this resource to elucidate the genes and genetic networks governing morphogenesis and virulence. This will reveal new strategies to cripple fungal pathogens, and drug targets to improve clinical outcome. The focus of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This eukaryotic pathogen has a profound impact on human health, with a global incidence of Candida bloodstream infections of ~400,000 cases, associated with crude mortality rates of 42% and attributable mortality rates of 27%; C. albicans is the most prevalent Candida species in almost all patient populations. The central hypotheses that govern this proposal are that functional genomic analysis of C. albicans using genome-scale libraries of double barcoded heterozygous gene deletion mutants and tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains will reveal novel circuitry governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence, and that targeting this circuitry has therapeutic potential for combating life-threatening fungal infections.","Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen",9213066,R01AI127375,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Aneuploidy', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Ascomycota', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Candida', 'Candida albicans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Cytolysis', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Essential Genes', 'Filament', 'Foundations', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Library', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Mycoses', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sepsis', 'Solid', 'Symbiosis', 'Systemic infection', 'Testing', 'Tetracyclines', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'attributable mortality', 'cancer therapy', 'combat', 'fitness', 'functional genomics', 'fungus', 'gene replacement', 'genome-wide', 'genomic platform', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'killings', 'member', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'trait', 'unpublished works']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2017,591721,0.023432077400649582
"Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving randomized left-right patterning of visceral organs, is frequently associated with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), a reflection of the importance of left-right patterning in formation of asymmetries in the four-chamber heart. Heterotaxy (HTX) patients have unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. This may reflect the common requirement for motile cilia, both in embryonic left-right patterning and also mucus clearance in the airway. We recently showed 42% of HTX patients with CHD (HTX/CHD) have airway ciliary dysfunction (CD) similar to that of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a recessive disorder associated with laterality defects and sinopulmonary disease due to mucus clearance defects caused by immotile/dyskinetic cilia in the airway. Significantly, exome sequencing showed HTX patients with CD (HTX/CD) are enriched for novel/rare coding variants (RCV) in genes known to cause PCD and other cilia related genes. In this application, we will functionally assay 53 cilia candidate genes identified in 39 HTX/CD patients by exome sequencing analysis. We will assess the effects of gene knockdown on airway cilia motility using a novel assay with reciliating human airway epithelial cells. To assay gene function required for left-right patternin, antisense MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos will be carried out to examine heart and gut looping. Genes shown to disrupt airway cilia motility and cause HTX after knockdown will be further tested to determine whether the RCVs are pathogenic. Specifically we will examine whether expression of the RCV can rescue the HTX phenotype elicited by MO gene knockdown in the zebrafish embryo. Given all of the RCVs identified in HTX/CD patients were heterozygous, we hypothesize a multigenic model of disease, which will be tested by examining the phenotypes of double heterozygous mouse and zebrafish mutants with two-gene combinations observed in the HTX-CD patients. We will examine for evidence of digenic interactions by assaying motile cilia function and visceral organ situs in the double heterozygous mutants. These experiments will interrogate 8 digenic combinations that make use of 9 novel mouse mutants recovered from our ongoing mouse mutagenesis screen, and 7 other digenic combinations in zebrafish using existing mutant lines and de novo production of 4 zebrafish knockout lines by TALENs gene disruption. Finally, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation in ciliary motion defects, we will develop software for quantitative classification of ciliary motin defects using a computational approach with computer vision and machine learning algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Using this software, we will determine whether different RCVs are associated with different ciliary motion defects. This will provide insights into structure-functio relationships in the regulation of cilia motility. This software, to be made available as an online tool, will have translational potential for clinical evaluation of patient airway ciliary motion daa. Together, these studies will establish functional assays and software that can elucidate the genetic etiology of CHD/HTX. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heterodoxy, a birth defect involving abnormal left-right patterning, have some of the most complex congenital heart defects. Such patients exhibit unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. As motile cilia function is required both for airway mucus clearance and embryonic left-right patterning, we will develop functional assays and software to assess cilia candidate genes containing rare coding variants identified in heterodoxy patients for their role in airway cilia motility and left-right patterning of organ asymmetries.",Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning,9118227,R01GM104412,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cilia', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Embryo', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Frequency', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Handedness', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Knock-out', 'Left', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Situs Inversus', 'Structure', 'Structure of respiratory epithelium', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'Visceral', 'Visual Pattern Recognition', 'With laterality', 'Zebrafish', 'airway epithelium', 'cilium motility', 'congenital heart disorder', 'disease phenotype', 'exome sequencing', 'founder mutation', 'gene function', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'software development', 'structural heart disease', 'tool', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,653850,0.0213825657761018
"Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Time to onset of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is expected to be influenced by multiple gene-gene interactions that add to the complexity of the genotype-phenotype mapping relationship. Unfortunately, parametric statistical methods such as Cox regression lack sufficient power to detect high-order gene-gene interactions due to the sparseness of the data. Machine learning methods offer a more powerful alternative but rely on computationally-intensive searching methods to identify the top models. We propose here to develop a powerful and computationally efficient bioinformatics strategy that combines machine learning algorithm and Cox regression for identifying gene-gene and gene-environment interaction models that are associated with time of onset of chronic disease. Specifically, we firs propose to develop a novel Robust Survival Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction method (RS-MDR) for the detection of gene-gene interactions in rare variants that influence time of onset of human disease (AIM 1). The power of RS-MDR method will be evaluated by comparing it to other existing methods in simulation studies. We then propose to change the representation space of the gene-gene interaction models using RS-MDR's construction induction method and apply L1 penalized Cox regression to identify a set of interaction models that can predict patients' survival probability (AIM 2). We hypothesize that RS-MDR can effectively identify high order interaction models and the combined approach provides a powerful and computational efficient way to select a set of interaction models. We will use extensive simulations that are derived from GWAS studies to thoroughly evaluate this hypothesis. Next, we will apply the new combined method for detecting and characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from large population-based studies of lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (AIM 3). Results from the real data analysis will be used to refine the method. Finally, we will distribute the proposed method as part of an open- source R software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the proposed method will combine the strength from both parametric and non-parametric methods and enable detection of interaction models that are jointly affecting time of onset of chronic diseases. This is important because time of onset has more variation than case-control status and it may be more clinically relevant. Furthermore, studies of genetic factors predicting time of onset have not been pursued aggressively using GWAS studies, despite the relevance of this information for the discovery of high risk variants like mutations in BRCA1. Narrative This project will provide a general method for genome data analysis that can be potentially apply to any specific disease. We focus the application of this method on an investigation into the role of genetic polymorphisms in lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. This will increase our knowledge of the basic biology and lead for screening and targeted therapy.",Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction,9097781,R01LM012012,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Europe', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'North America', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinically relevant', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'simulation', 'survival outcome', 'targeted treatment']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,352350,0.01813938342862109
"Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cellular signal transduction system (CSTS) plays a fundamental role in maintaining homeostasis of a cell, and perturbations of CSTS lead to diseases such as cancers and diabetes. Most of cellular signaling pathways eventually regulate gene expression, thus the latter can be used as a universal bioassay reflecting the state of CSTS. However, the gene expression profile from a cell reflects a mixture of responses to all active signaling pathways, thus it is a challenge to de-convolute the signals embedded in the gene expression data. With advent of high throughput biotechnology, major public databases host the results of millions of gene expression assays, collected under diverse diseases as well as the experimental conditions designed by experimental biologists to probe almost all aspects of CSTS. The wealth of these big data provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate CSTS under physiological and pathological conditions, but it also poses unprecedented challenges: how to reveal signals from convoluted data and turn big data into knowledge. We hypothesize that given a sufficiently large compendium of gene expression data collected under diverse conditions, in which different parts of CSTS are perturbed (either by designed experiments or by diseases), the cellular signals embedded in the gene expression data can be revealed and their organization can inferred using current state-of-the-art ""deep learning"" models. In this project, we will compil a comprehensive compendium of human gene expression data and then employ modern deep-learning algorithms and supercomputers to mine the data. We aim to reveal major cellular signals that regulate gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions and to infer the organization of signals in human CSTS. Combined the identified signals with genomic alteration data and drug response data, we aim to further identify pathways underlying disease such as cancers, to use the genomic data to predict drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines, and to predict patient clinical outcomes, in a pathway-centered manner. This project aims to develop and apply novel “deep learning” algorithms to mine a comprehensive compendium of genome-scale data in order to reveal the major signals regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions. This knowledge can be further applied to understand disease mechanisms of cancers and guide personalized treatment of cancer patients.",Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium,9042426,R01LM012011,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'abstracting', 'cancer genome', 'cancer subtypes', 'data mining', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'drug mechanism', 'drug sensitivity', 'environmental change', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'research study', 'response', 'supercomputer', 'translational medicine', 'translational study']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,328232,0.047558444222969364
"Turning Data into Whole Cell Ontology Models for Functional Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A holy grail of bioinformatics is the creation of whole-cell models with the ability to enhance human understanding and facilitate discovery. To this end, a successful and widely-used effort is the Gene Ontology (GO), a massive project to manually annotate genes into terms describing molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components and provide relationships between terms, e.g. capturing that ""small ribosomal subunit"" and ""large ribosomal subunit"" come together to make ""ribosome"". GO is widely used to understand the function of a gene or group of genes. Unfortunately, GO is limited by the effort required to create and update it by hand. It exists only for well-studied organisms and even then in only one, generic form per organism with limited overall genome coverage and a bias towards well-studied genes and functions. It is not possible to learn about an uncharacterized gene or discover a new function using GO, and one cannot quickly assemble an ontology model for a new organism, let alone a specific cell-type or disease-state.  This proposed research will change this state of affairs. Already, work has shown that large networks of gene and protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be used to computationally infer an ontology whose coverage and power are equivalent to those of the manually-curated GO Cellular Component ontology. Still, this first attempt was limited in the types of experimental data used and its ability to infer the more generally useful Biological Process ontology. Here machine learning approaches will be applied to integrate many types of experimental data into ontology model construction and analyze the type of biological information provided by each experiment, revealing those experiments most informative for capturing Biological Process information. Furthermore, the high-throughput experimental data to ontology paradigm explored here will be used to develop a computational tool to highlight novel types of hypotheses that are inaccessible by current high-throughput experimental data analysis methods.  Preliminary work has shown GO to be useful for prediction of synthetic lethal pairs of genes, i.e. genes that are individually non-essential but when knocked out together cause cell death. Given the high mutation rate in cancer, these pairs provide potential cancer drug targets, as a drug may target a gene product which is now essential in the mutated cancer cells but not other cells, thereby killing only cancer cells. Because data-driven ontologies are not as hindered by issues with bias and coverage and are specifically designed to capture only functional relationships, this proposal will explore the idea that data-driven ontologies will be better suited to help predict synthetic lethal pairs than GO. To this end, algorithms will be developed to construct a data-driven ontology of yeast DNA repair and use this ontology to predict synthetic lethal pairs of genes.  Overall, this proposal will develop the computational and experimental roadmap to construct a whole-cell model of gene function - an ontology - and use the model to discover useful biology - synthetic lethal pairs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposal, a new framework for using the results of commonly performed, genome-wide experiments has the potential to create whole-cell models of gene function, similar to the widely-used Gene Ontology, directly from data without manual intervention. This will allow creation of useful models of cells from different organisms, tissues and diseases which researchers can use to discover the function of unstudied genes and to uncover new functions performed by the cell. Furthermore, this proposal will use these models for the discovery of new cancer drug targets called synthetic lethal pairs of genes.            ",Turning Data into Whole Cell Ontology Models for Functional Analysis,9145523,F30HG007618,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Processed Genes', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Update', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'biological information processing', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental analysis', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'gene product', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'killings', 'novel', 'novel anticancer drug', 'prediction algorithm', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F30,2016,48576,0.018158091354866995
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,9136115,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'DNA cassette', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'dietary manipulation', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'humanized mouse', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,662793,0.03680924617648766
"Separating Wheat from Chaff in Major Depression Blood Biomarker Studies Project Summary Blood expression profiling of major depression disorder (MDD) patients has the potential to refine disease classification and diagnosis, elucidate molecular mechanisms, and improve drug targeting and clinical trial outcomes. However, the only significant finding in the largest MDD blood RNA study, a recent RNAseq profiling of 922 individuals comparing MDD patients with healthy controls, was a composite increase in the expression of genes associated with the interferon response pathway in MDD. Statistical analysis of such datasets is complicated by disease heterogeneity and by sources of inter-individual gene expression variation, such as high person-to-person differences in human blood cell type proportions, making it difficult to find measurements that robustly distinguish clinical groups. We have recently developed latent variable based computational approaches that more effectively model heterogeneity including blood proportions in blood gene expression data and that improve the identification of disease associated differentially expressed genes and disease-associated differences in cell type proportions. We have demonstrated that our methods increase the power to detect differentially expressed genes and improve agreement among separate studies of disease-associated global RNA expression. The latent variable framework we use can be exploited for interpreting the observed changes by attributing them to specific blood cell types. Preliminary analysis using these approaches on the large recent MDD RNAseq dataset finds evidence for additional depression related signatures and differentially expressed RNAs not detected by the original analysis. Analysis of the association of these signatures with acute symptoms and their stability over time in individuals suggests that they are most likely novel MDD trait markers. We will apply this enhanced methodology to identify novel MDD-associated genes in this large RNAseq dataset, confirm these signatures by analysis of other MDD public datasets, investigate the state/trait and genetic basis for these signatures and use machine learning to generate a purely clinical and biological data-driven classification of depression subgroups. This study is expected to result in an improved analysis framework for blood RNA biomarkers studies of psychiatric disease, significant new insight into MDD associated cell type proportion and blood gene expression trait signatures, and the identification of molecularly coherent depression subgroups. Project Narrative We have developed new computational methods that improve the ability to identify blood gene expression changes in genome-wide studies of blood in MDD. We will apply enhanced versions of these methods to investigate public MDD datasets.

"A web-based craniofacial disease gene discovery tool ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Craniofacial (CF) abnormalities constitute more than a third of all human structural birth defects. To define their genetic etiology, detailed molecular understanding is required of coordinated movement and fusion of embryonic facial prominences - as disruption of these morphogenetic events cause defects such as orofacial clefts (OFC). The NIH FaceBase initiative is an important step to address this need, as it aims to generate comprehensive whole-genome expression datasets using microarrays or Next-Gen RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on mouse embryonic CF tissue. However, genome-wide profiling identifies several thousand ""expressed"" genes and it is a formidable challenge to predict and prioritize the select few genes that are critical to tissue development or pathogenesis. We posit that although there is a wealth of genomic-level data available, this deficit remains because an adequate strategy has not yet been applied to identify these important candidate CF genes. We recently developed an innovative approach - termed in silico whole embryo body (WB) subtraction - to identify such important genes based on developmentally-enriched expression. We have applied this novel approach to ~15% of FaceBase data and assembled this knowledge as a user-friendly web-based interactive tool SysFACE (Systems tool for craniofacial expression-based gene discovery, http://bioinformatics.udel.edu/Research/SysFACE). Even with limited datasets, the beta version of SysFACE is significantly more effective, compared with unprocessed FaceBase datasets, in identification of known genes associated with OFCs from both linkage and GWAS studies. To process all existing FaceBase datasets, we will generate additional platform-specific WB reference datasets and evaluate these further with machine learning strategies to identify genes important to CF development (Aim 1). Subsequently, we aim to experimentally validate these tissue-enriched gene expression profiles, and to assemble this knowledge - along with a new evidence-based functional gene regulatory network (GRN) that will allow all molecular data from the CF published literature to be represented on systems level - as a user-friendly web-based interactive resource (Aim 2), which will also be made available through FaceBase. Development of SysFACE, as outlined in this application, will greatly improve prediction of candidate CF genes, provide an excellent resource for CF-network construction, and will facilitate CF gene discovery efforts by developmental biologists and clinicians. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Craniofacial malformations are common among structural birth defects among which orofacial clefts alone occur in 1/800 live-births and carry a lifetime cost for medical treatment, rehabilitation services and lost productivity of more than $100,000 per affected person. This application seeks to analyze FaceBase gene expression data using an integrated approach to develop a web-based user-friendly tool SysFACE - for both clinicians and scientists - that predicts and prioritizes craniofacial genes. SysFACE, available through FaceBase, will accelerate craniofacial disease gene discovery, which in turn will facilitate identification of new therapeutic approaches.",A web-based craniofacial disease gene discovery tool,9107846,R03DE024776,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryo', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye Development', 'Eye diseases', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Online Systems', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'System', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual Fields', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost effective', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'data mining', 'evidence base', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'gene interaction', 'genome browser', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'life time cost', 'microdeletion', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'orofacial cleft', 'rehabilitation service', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'web based interface', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R03,2016,192500,0.04060005786734554
"Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although investments in genomic studies of mental disorders enabled the discovery of thousands of robustly associated variants with these complex diseases, the translation of these discoveries into actionable targets has been hampered by the lack of a mechanistic understanding on how genome variation relates to phenotype. Moreover, it has been widely shown that a substantial portion of the genetic control of complex traits, including mental disorders, is exerted through the regulation of gene expression. However, effective methods to fully harness this mechanism are lagging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel gene-based test -PrediXcan- that directly tests this regulatory mechanism and substantially improves power relative to single variant tests and other gene-based tests. PrediXcan is inherently mechanistic and provides directionality, highlighting its potential utility in identifying novel targets for therapy. The method consists of predicting the whole genome effect on expression traits and correlating this effect with disease risk to identify novel disease genes. In addition, we propose novel approaches to investigate the context-specificity of expression traits (Orthogonal Tissue Decomposition) and to quantify the collective effect of the regulated transcriptome on phenotypes of interest (Regulability). Regulability is similar to the concept of chip heritability (total variability explained collectivey by genotyped variants). First, we will develop cross-tissue, tissue-specific (for over 30 different human tissue types), and brain-region specific expression traits. We will use statistical machine learning methods to develop whole genome prediction models for these traits and extend this work to other molecular phenotypes. All models will be stored in open access databases. Next, we will apply the PrediXcan method to 7 mental disorder phenotypes. More specifically, we will compute genetically predicted levels of gene expression traits and correlate them with disease risk to identify genes involved in disease pathways. We will also quantify the collective effect of the predicted transcriptome (regulability) on mental disorder risk across multiple tissues. Finally we will extend PrediXcan method and develop a method to infer the results of PrediXcan using summary statistics data as opposed to individual level data. This will extend the applicability of the approach to all summary results generated by meta-analysis consortia and increase the power to discover novel genes given the larger sample sizes. The research we propose is driven by an extensive set of preliminary studies, and promises substantial deliverables in both new methods of analysis and public access results databases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large investments in genome studies have been made to understand the consequences of genetic variation on human traits. These have yielded many genetic variants reproducibly associated with disease but the underlying biology is still unclear. We propose a novel computational method that links mechanistically the genetic variability to disease risk and apply it to a range of mental disorder studies to provide more biological insights and enable discovery of potential targets for drug development.","Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect",9130902,R01MH107666,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Architecture', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain region', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Etiology', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'disorder risk', 'drug development', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'molecular phenotype', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'user friendly software', 'web app', 'whole genome']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2016,430578,0.002007314703019695
"INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The applicant is an Assistant Professor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School.  The applicant's research program focuses on developing methods in translational bioinformatics to integrate heterogeneous biomedical data types (genomic, transcriptomic, microscopic, clinical) enabling the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics for patients. Recent projects completed by the applicant include: the development of the Computational Pathology (C-Path) platform for building prognostic models from microscopic image data (Science Translational Medicine, 2011); and the development of the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures method for identifying robust prognostic gene expression signatures form clinically annotated genomic data (PLoS Computational Biology, 2013).     This K22 award will provide the applicant with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert at designing and using ontologies to model Computational Pathology data and to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase; (2) to become an expert at integrative predictive modeling of Computational Pathology data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data; and (3) to develop and manage an independent research career in translational bioinformatics. To achieve these goals, the applicant has assembled a team of mentors and collaborators with expertise in each of these areas of translational biomedical informatics. The team includes: Dr. Isaac Kohane, who is a Professor of Pediatrics, directs the Children's Hospital Informatics Program and leads an NLM-supported national center for biomedical computing; Dr. Ron Kikinis who is a Professor at Harvard Medical School, and the Robert Greenes Distinguished Director of Biomedical Informatics in the Department of Radiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital; and Dr. John Quackenbush, who is a Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Professor of Cancer Biology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.     During the K22 award program, the applicant and his study team will develop informatics models and methods for Computational Pathology data. In Aim 1, they will develop a Computational Pathology Ontology to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase. The knowledgebase will be populated with microscopic phenotype data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data from over 2,500 cancer patients that underwent molecular profiling as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project. In Specific Aim 2, they will develop and apply methods in machine learning to identify associations between gene expression and microscopic phenotypes.

"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient.

"Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to define genes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been cataloged on gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human disease, our understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. To address this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote health, we propose develop mutagenic, revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific, untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. The goals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to make site-specific double strand breaks. First, we propose to develop a suite of vectors to make integration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertible alleles. Second, we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish at TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomology mediated end-joining pathway. Third, leveraging our preliminary data, we propose to improve methods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated alleles in zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth, we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highly mutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promote health following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafish due to their ease of gene delivery, we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance the efficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms and large animals. In our opinion, this will have important implications for modeling human disease and health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles, small nucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease, and conditional alleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health. The central goal for this application is to define genes that can promote or restore human health. For this, we propose to develop efficient integration of highly mutagenic and conditional cassettes into genes in a site-directed manner. The strategies proposed employ the ability of designer nucleases to create DNA double strand breaks and to site-specifically direct biochemical activities to genes of interest.

"Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular smooth muscle (SMC) phenotypic modulation, the transition from a contractile to a proliferative phenotype accompanied by neointima formation following vascular injury, plays a critical role in the development and progression of several proliferative cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. The regulatory mechanisms underlying SMC phenotypic modulation, however, are poorly understood. A hallmark feature of the phenotypic modulation is the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a well-known stimulator of SMC phenotypic modulation, down- regulates SMC gene expression and stimulates SMC proliferation via posttranscriptional regulation of the related genes. The post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in SMC phenotype gene expression, however, remain largely unknown. Our exciting preliminary data indicate that the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes is caused by abnormal RNA editing of their precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs). This abnormal pre-mRNA editing is facilitated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), which converts adenosines to inosines (A->I editing). A-to-I RNA editing of the pre-mRNA transcripts from introns or 3'-untranslated regions alters pre- mRNA splicing, leading to decreased mature mRNA levels and abnormal cellular functions. PDGF-BB induces ADAR1 while down-regulating SMC myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) and calponin (CNN). Knockdown of ADAR1 by shRNA restores PDGF-BB-blocked SMMHC and CNN expression, demonstrating that ADAR1 plays an essential role in SMC phenotype modulation. ADAR1 appears to be also important for PDGF-BB-induced SMC proliferation/survival. In vivo studies show that SMMHC and CNN pre-mRNA is accumulated when their mature mRNA is decreased in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Moreover, ADAR1 is highly induced in media layer SMCs initially, and neointima SMCs subsequently following the injury. Of importance, knockdown of ADAR1 dramatically inhibits injury-induced neointima formation, demonstrating a critical role of ADAR1 in vascular remodeling in vivo. These seminal findings strongly support a novel hypothesis that ADAR1/abnormal RNA editing mediates PDGF-BB-induced down-regulation of SMC contractile genes and SMC proliferation/survival, leading to SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling. Using primary culture of SMCs, in vivo rat balloon injury and mouse wire injury models combining with molecular, cellular and histological approaches, we will 1) determine the role and mechanism whereby ADAR1 modulates SMC phenotype; 2) elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ADAR1 function in regulating SMC proliferation/survival; and 3) study the role of ADAR1 in SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling in vivo. Successful completion of these aims will unravel a novel mechanism governing SMC phenotypic modulation, which will ultimately lead to identification of novel targets for developing therapeuti agents to treat proliferative vascular diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of mortality in the United States. Transition of vascular smooth muscle (SMC) from a differentiated phenotype to a proliferative state accompanied by neointima formation plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. In this application, a combination of molecular, cellular, and genetic approaches with gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies will be used to establish a novel mechanism underlying SMC phenotypic modulation. The completion of this project will advance our understanding of the fundamental pathologic mechanisms that contribute to the progression of aforementioned proliferative vascular diseases, and most importantly, lead to identification of important novel targets for developing therapeutic agents to treat these diseases.",Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling,8998053,R01HL119053,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'ADAR1', 'Adenosine', 'Angioplasty', 'Ants', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Cell physiology', 'Contractile Proteins', 'Contracts', 'DRADA2b protein', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypertension', 'Injury', 'Inosine', 'Introns', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lead', 'MYH11 gene', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Myosin Heavy Chains', 'Pathologic', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Proliferation', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Veins', 'calponin', 'dsRNA adenosine deaminase', 'gain of function', 'genetic approach', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'knock-down', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Precursor', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neointima formation', 'novel', 'platelet-derived growth factor BB', 'protein expression', 'restenosis', 'small hairpin RNA', 'teration']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2016,375000,-0.025903646576158366
"Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures Project Summary/Abstract  The placenta is an essential organ in human development, and disruption of its function can result in problems in pregnancy including miscarriage, preterm labor, preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Additionally, disrupted placenta function during pregnancy has been associated with a great number of disorders and diseases that do not present until much later in the offspring's life such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, developmental delay and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. How the exposures encountered in the environment drive alterations in placenta structure and function is poorly understood, and placenta function is difficult to assess in vivo using noninvasive methods. We propose to understand how gene expression is altered in the placenta during gestation by noninvasively characterizing the placenta transcriptome in association with exposure to chemicals known to alter endocrine signaling. These chemicals, called phthalates, are commonly found in a variety of commercial products such as plastics and personal care products, and phthalate exposure has also been shown to effect neurodevelopment. The link between phthalate exposure and placenta gene expression in vivo is not yet clear; therefore we have assembled a team comprised of neuroscientists, placenta biologists, environmental epidemiologists, and genomics experts do address how phthalate exposure and gestational age effects gene that are expressed in the placenta but not in other tissues. One of the advantages of the proposed research is that we will assess placenta gene expression noninvasively through RNA molecules contained in extracellular vesicles that are secreted into the urine of pregnant women. Collecting gene expression data and chemical exposure data from urine is highly clinically relevant, and we expect our approach will have clear translational applications just as home pregnancy tests that rely on the detection of placenta produced hormones in urine have become common. Our proposed study will provide the basic science background for the development of rapid, noninvasive tests for assessing placenta function, chemical exposures, and ultimately problems in neurodevelopment and other danger signals during pregnancy. Project Narrative  The proposed research will collect genome wide placenta gene expression data from 50 pregnant women at three time points during gestation. In addition to assessing gene expression differences the proposed research will develop methods to noninvasively determine placenta-originating transcripts among all transcripts existing in the urine of pregnant women. The proposed research will also compare gene expression to endocrine disrupting chemicals known to cause health problems.",Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures,9197555,R21ES027878,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin', 'Collection', 'Conceptus', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Illinois', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Placenta', 'Placentation', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Tests', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Procedures', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Stromal Cells', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Syncytiotrophoblast', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Urine', 'Uterine cavity', 'Villous', 'abstracting', 'age effect', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytotrophoblast', 'design', 'developmental toxicology', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome-wide', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal morbidity', 'personal care products', 'phthalates', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'response', 'study population', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2016,245727,0.050223775362451

"Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving randomized left-right patterning of visceral organs, is frequently associated with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), a reflection of the importance of left-right patterning in formation of asymmetries in the four-chamber heart. Heterotaxy (HTX) patients have unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. This may reflect the common requirement for motile cilia, both in embryonic left-right patterning and also mucus clearance in the airway. We recently showed 42% of HTX patients with CHD (HTX/CHD) have airway ciliary dysfunction (CD) similar to that of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a recessive disorder associated with laterality defects and sinopulmonary disease due to mucus clearance defects caused by immotile/dyskinetic cilia in the airway. Significantly, exome sequencing showed HTX patients with CD (HTX/CD) are enriched for novel/rare coding variants (RCV) in genes known to cause PCD and other cilia related genes. In this application, we will functionally assay 53 cilia candidate genes identified in 39 HTX/CD patients by exome sequencing analysis. We will assess the effects of gene knockdown on airway cilia motility using a novel assay with reciliating human airway epithelial cells. To assay gene function required for left-right patternin, antisense MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos will be carried out to examine heart and gut looping. Genes shown to disrupt airway cilia motility and cause HTX after knockdown will be further tested to determine whether the RCVs are pathogenic. Specifically we will examine whether expression of the RCV can rescue the HTX phenotype elicited by MO gene knockdown in the zebrafish embryo. Given all of the RCVs identified in HTX/CD patients were heterozygous, we hypothesize a multigenic model of disease, which will be tested by examining the phenotypes of double heterozygous mouse and zebrafish mutants with two-gene combinations observed in the HTX-CD patients. We will examine for evidence of digenic interactions by assaying motile cilia function and visceral organ situs in the double heterozygous mutants. These experiments will interrogate 8 digenic combinations that make use of 9 novel mouse mutants recovered from our ongoing mouse mutagenesis screen, and 7 other digenic combinations in zebrafish using existing mutant lines and de novo production of 4 zebrafish knockout lines by TALENs gene disruption. Finally, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation in ciliary motion defects, we will develop software for quantitative classification of ciliary motin defects using a computational approach with computer vision and machine learning algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Using this software, we will determine whether different RCVs are associated with different ciliary motion defects. This will provide insights into structure-functio relationships in the regulation of cilia motility. This software, to be made available as an online tool, will have translational potential for clinical evaluation of patient airway ciliary motion daa. Together, these studies will establish functional assays and software that can elucidate the genetic etiology of CHD/HTX. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heterodoxy, a birth defect involving abnormal left-right patterning, have some of the most complex congenital heart defects.

"Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Time to onset of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes is expected to be influenced by multiple gene-gene interactions that add to the complexity of the genotype-phenotype mapping relationship. Unfortunately, parametric statistical methods such as Cox regression lack sufficient power to detect high-order gene-gene interactions due to the sparseness of the data. Machine learning methods offer a more powerful alternative but rely on computationally-intensive searching methods to identify the top models. We propose here to develop a powerful and computationally efficient bioinformatics strategy that combines machine learning algorithm and Cox regression for identifying gene-gene and gene-environment interaction models that are associated with time of onset of chronic disease. Specifically, we firs propose to develop a novel Robust Survival Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction method (RS-MDR) for the detection of gene-gene interactions in rare variants that influence time of onset of human disease (AIM 1). The power of RS-MDR method will be evaluated by comparing it to other existing methods in simulation studies. We then propose to change the representation space of the gene-gene interaction models using RS-MDR's construction induction method and apply L1 penalized Cox regression to identify a set of interaction models that can predict patients' survival probability (AIM 2). We hypothesize that RS-MDR can effectively identify high order interaction models and the combined approach provides a powerful and computational efficient way to select a set of interaction models. We will use extensive simulations that are derived from GWAS studies to thoroughly evaluate this hypothesis. Next, we will apply the new combined method for detecting and characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from large population-based studies of lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (AIM 3). Results from the real data analysis will be used to refine the method. Finally, we will distribute the proposed method as part of an open- source R software package (AIM 4). We anticipate that the proposed method will combine the strength from both parametric and non-parametric methods and enable detection of interaction models that are jointly affecting time of onset of chronic diseases. This is important because time of onset has more variation than case-control status and it may be more clinically relevant. Furthermore, studies of genetic factors predicting time of onset have not been pursued aggressively using GWAS studies, despite the relevance of this information for the discovery of high risk variants like mutations in BRCA1.             Narrative This project will provide a general method for genome data analysis that can be potentially apply to any specific disease. We focus the application of this method on an investigation into the role of genetic polymorphisms in lung cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. This will increase our knowledge of the basic biology and lead for screening and targeted therapy.",Bioinformatics strategies to relate age of onset with gene-gene interaction,8962812,R01LM012012,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Europe', 'Gene Order', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'North America', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinically relevant', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'simulation', 'targeted treatment']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,352350,0.01813938342862109
"Deciphering cellular signaling system by deep mining a comprehensive genomic compendium ﻿Cellular signal transduction system (CSTS) plays a fundamental role in maintaining homeostasis of a cell, and perturbations of CSTS lead to diseases such as cancers and diabetes. Most of cellular signaling pathways eventually regulate gene expression, thus the latter can be used as a universal bioassay reflecting the state of CSTS. However, the gene expression profile from a cell reflects a mixture of responses to all active signaling pathways, thus it is a challenge to de-convolute the signals embedded in the gene expression data. With advent of high throughput biotechnology, major public databases host the results of millions of gene expression assays, collected under diverse diseases as well as the experimental conditions designed by experimental biologists to probe almost all aspects of CSTS. The wealth of these big data provides unprecedented opportunities to investigate CSTS under physiological and pathological conditions, but it also poses unprecedented challenges: how to reveal signals from convoluted data and turn big data into knowledge. We hypothesize that given a sufficiently large compendium of gene expression data collected under diverse conditions, in which different parts of CSTS are perturbed (either by designed experiments or by diseases), the cellular signals embedded in the gene expression data can be revealed and their organization can inferred using current state-of-the-art ""deep learning"" models. In this project, we will compil a comprehensive compendium of human gene expression data and then employ modern deep-learning algorithms and supercomputers to mine the data. We aim to reveal major cellular signals that regulate gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions and to infer the organization of signals in human CSTS. Combined the identified signals with genomic alteration data and drug response data, we aim to further identify pathways underlying disease such as cancers, to use the genomic data to predict drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines, and to predict patient clinical outcomes, in a pathway-centered manner. This project aims to develop and apply novel “deep learning” algorithms to mine a comprehensive compendium of genome-scale data in order to reveal the major signals regulating gene expression under physiological and pathological conditions.

"Turning Data into Whole Cell Ontology Models for Functional Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A holy grail of bioinformatics is the creation of whole-cell models with the ability to enhance human understanding and facilitate discovery. To this end, a successful and widely-used effort is the Gene Ontology (GO), a massive project to manually annotate genes into terms describing molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components and provide relationships between terms, e.g. capturing that ""small ribosomal subunit"" and ""large ribosomal subunit"" come together to make ""ribosome"". GO is widely used to understand the function of a gene or group of genes. Unfortunately, GO is limited by the effort required to create and update it by hand. It exists only for well-studied organisms and even then in only one, generic form per organism with limited overall genome coverage and a bias towards well-studied genes and functions. It is not possible to learn about an uncharacterized gene or discover a new function using GO, and one cannot quickly assemble an ontology model for a new organism, let alone a specific cell-type or disease-state.  This proposed research will change this state of affairs. Already, work has shown that large networks of gene and protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be used to computationally infer an ontology whose coverage and power are equivalent to those of the manually-curated GO Cellular Component ontology. Still, this first attempt was limited in the types of experimental data used and its ability to infer the more generally useful Biological Process ontology. Here machine learning approaches will be applied to integrate many types of experimental data into ontology model construction and analyze the type of biological information provided by each experiment, revealing those experiments most informative for capturing Biological Process information. Furthermore, the high-throughput experimental data to ontology paradigm explored here will be used to develop a computational tool to highlight novel types of hypotheses that are inaccessible by current high-throughput experimental data analysis methods.  Preliminary work has shown GO to be useful for prediction of synthetic lethal pairs of genes, i.e. genes that are individually non-essential but when knocked out together cause cell death. Given the high mutation rate in cancer, these pairs provide potential cancer drug targets, as a drug may target a gene product which is now essential in the mutated cancer cells but not other cells, thereby killing only cancer cells. Because data-driven ontologies are not as hindered by issues with bias and coverage and are specifically designed to capture only functional relationships, this proposal will explore the idea that data-driven ontologies will be better suited to help predict synthetic lethal pairs than GO. To this end, algorithms will be developed to construct a data-driven ontology of yeast DNA repair and use this ontology to predict synthetic lethal pairs of genes.  Overall, this proposal will develop the computational and experimental roadmap to construct a whole-cell model of gene function - an ontology - and use the model to discover useful biology - synthetic lethal pairs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposal, a new framework for using the results of commonly performed, genome-wide experiments has the potential to create whole-cell models of gene function, similar to the widely-used Gene Ontology, directly from data without manual intervention. This will allow creation of useful models of cells from different organisms, tissues and diseases which researchers can use to discover the function of unstudied genes and to uncover new functions performed by the cell. Furthermore, this proposal will use these models for the discovery of new cancer drug targets called synthetic lethal pairs of genes.            ",Turning Data into Whole Cell Ontology Models for Functional Analysis,8951600,F30HG007618,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Processed Genes', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Update', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'biological information processing', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental analysis', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'killings', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F30,2015,39304,0.018158091354866995
"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposed research describes the engineering of novel polymers using combinatorial syntheses and cheminformatic modeling for enhanced transgene expression in cells. The efficacy and biocompatibility (toxicity) of polymers and combination treatments will be evaluated in vitro and in vivo (in mice).",Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods,8786566,R01GM093229,"['Affinity', 'Amines', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Apoptosis', 'Biocompatible', 'Biodistribution', 'Cells', 'Combinatorial Synthesis', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA delivery', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Ethers', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Transduction Agent', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Hydrophobicity', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Libraries', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Viral Vector', 'Phenotype', 'Plasmids', 'Polyamines', 'Polymers', 'Property', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'SCID Mice', 'Structure', 'TNFSF10 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes', 'Validation', 'Viral Vector', 'Xenograft Model', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'bone', 'cancer cell', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'combinatorial chemistry', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene therapy', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'luminescence', 'milligram', 'model design', 'monomer', 'multitask', 'nanoparticle', 'non-viral gene delivery', 'novel', 'prostate cancer cell', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'trafficking', 'transgene expression', 'vector', 'zeta potential']",NIGMS,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2015,289337,0.04630184755457622
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,8928177,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'Cresols', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,673919,0.03680924617648766
"Multiscale Framework for Molecular Heterogeneity Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic profiling has become a routine practice in selecting treatments for many diseases, enabling the classification of patients into categories that associate with improved outcomes for specific treatments. One potential detractor to this approach is the tremendous heterogeneity in tissues used for profiling. Genomic classifications, obtained from a relatively small biopsy, are subject to influence from broad, regional variations in the affected tissue. Heterogeneity on a cellular scale can also obscure the target of treatment, as cells with distinct molecular profiles are homogenized in genomic profiling. Realizing better therapies will depend greatly on the ability to understand molecular heterogeneity within an individual, a challenge that necessitates new approaches to organize, analyze and integrate data from multiple spatial and molecular scales. This proposal describes an informatics framework to characterizing heterogeneity for tissue based studies. The framework will combine imaging informatics with genomics to describe molecular heterogeneity at multiple spatial and molecular scales. The imaging component will leverage a novel quantum dot technology that enables detailed mapping of multiple protein expression pathways within a single sample. Fluorescence in situ hybridization imaging will be used to measure DNA content. Whole-slide digitization will enable computer algorithms to capture molecular profiles of hundreds of millions of cells, calculating quantitative features to describe their expression patterns and DNA content. Biologically meaningful descriptions of each cell will be generated using a novel active machine learning classifier to annotate cells with an ontology describing molecular biology and cell anatomy, enabling slides to be analyzed in a biological context. Cell boundaries, features, and annotations will be integrated through the Pathology Analytic Imaging Standards (PAIS) database to provide support for data mining analysis. Mining methods will be developed to find the enrichment of cellular phenotypes, and to analyze the spatial layout of cells with respect to structures like blood vessels to discover the influence of the tissue microenvironment on key expression pathways in surrounding cells. These tools will be applied to studies of glioblastoma brain tumors, but are relevant for studies of other solid tissue diseases. The scientific study wil use tissues resected in a novel clinical trial that accurately defines the invading tumor margin, bulk and necrosis-rich core. Tissues will be analyzed for gene expression and imaging to generate a paired genomic-imaging profile for each region. Mining the imaging and gene expression profiles of these regions will identify intra-tumoral differences in cellular phenotypes and illustrate the extent of variation in genomic classifications. The paired imaging and gene expression profiles will also be mined to determine relationships between specific expression classes and the imaging observations to illustrate a complete picture of heterogeneity. A project repository will be deployed to disseminate images, analysis pipelines and analytic results. This repository will provide a public resource for brain tumor research and access to open source tools.

The software tools created by this research will enable researchers to better identify variations in the mechanisms of disease within an individual, and to develop and apply more effective therapies to improve patient outcomes.",Multiscale Framework for Molecular Heterogeneity Analysis,8897444,K22LM011576,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Invaded', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Necrosis', 'Ontology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Ploidies', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Dots', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Slide', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'comparative', 'data mining', 'effective therapy', 'exome', 'human tissue', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'molecular scale', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'protein expression', 'repository', 'routine practice', 'small molecule', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'tumor']",NLM,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K22,2015,160696,0.007697808607649412
"A web-based craniofacial disease gene discovery tool ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Craniofacial (CF) abnormalities constitute more than a third of all human structural birth defects. To define their genetic etiology, detailed molecular understanding is required of coordinated movement and fusion of embryonic facial prominences - as disruption of these morphogenetic events cause defects such as orofacial clefts (OFC). The NIH FaceBase initiative is an important step to address this need, as it aims to generate comprehensive whole-genome expression datasets using microarrays or Next-Gen RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on mouse embryonic CF tissue. However, genome-wide profiling identifies several thousand ""expressed"" genes and it is a formidable challenge to predict and prioritize the select few genes that are critical to tissue development or pathogenesis. We posit that although there is a wealth of genomic-level data available, this deficit remains because an adequate strategy has not yet been applied to identify these important candidate CF genes. We recently developed an innovative approach - termed in silico whole embryo body (WB) subtraction - to identify such important genes based on developmentally-enriched expression. We have applied this novel approach to ~15% of FaceBase data and assembled this knowledge as a user-friendly web-based interactive tool SysFACE (Systems tool for craniofacial expression-based gene discovery, http://bioinformatics.udel.edu/Research/SysFACE). Even with limited datasets, the beta version of SysFACE is significantly more effective, compared with unprocessed FaceBase datasets, in identification of known genes associated with OFCs from both linkage and GWAS studies. To process all existing FaceBase datasets, we will generate additional platform-specific WB reference datasets and evaluate these further with machine learning strategies to identify genes important to CF development (Aim 1). Subsequently, we aim to experimentally validate these tissue-enriched gene expression profiles, and to assemble this knowledge - along with a new evidence-based functional gene regulatory network (GRN) that will allow all molecular data from the CF published literature to be represented on systems level - as a user-friendly web-based interactive resource (Aim 2), which will also be made available through FaceBase. Development of SysFACE, as outlined in this application, will greatly improve prediction of candidate CF genes, provide an excellent resource for CF-network construction, and will facilitate CF gene discovery efforts by developmental biologists and clinicians.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Craniofacial malformations are common among structural birth defects among which orofacial clefts alone occur in 1/800 live-births and carry a lifetime cost for medical treatment, rehabilitation services and lost productivity of more than $100,000 per affected person. This application seeks to analyze FaceBase gene expression data using an integrated approach to develop a web-based user-friendly tool SysFACE - for both clinicians and scientists - that predicts and prioritizes craniofacial genes. SysFACE, available through FaceBase, will accelerate craniofacial disease gene discovery, which in turn will facilitate identification of new therapeutic approaches.                ",A web-based craniofacial disease gene discovery tool,8970355,R03DE024776,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryo', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Eye Development', 'Eye diseases', 'Face', 'FaceBase', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Online Systems', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'RNA Sequences', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Structural Congenital Anomalies', 'System', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual Fields', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost effective', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'data mining', 'evidence base', 'exome sequencing', 'gene discovery', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lens', 'life time cost', 'microdeletion', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'orofacial', 'orofacial cleft', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation service', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'web based interface']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R03,2015,282000,0.04060005786734554
"INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The applicant is an Assistant Professor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School.  The applicant's research program focuses on developing methods in translational bioinformatics to integrate heterogeneous biomedical data types (genomic, transcriptomic, microscopic, clinical) enabling the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics for patients. Recent projects completed by the applicant include: the development of the Computational Pathology (C-Path) platform for building prognostic models from microscopic image data (Science Translational Medicine, 2011); and the development of the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures method for identifying robust prognostic gene expression signatures form clinically annotated genomic data (PLoS Computational Biology, 2013).     This K22 award will provide the applicant with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert at designing and using ontologies to model Computational Pathology data and to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase; (2) to become an expert at integrative predictive modeling of Computational Pathology data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data; and (3) to develop and manage an independent research career in translational bioinformatics. To achieve these goals, the applicant has assembled a team of mentors and collaborators with expertise in each of these areas of translational biomedical informatics. The team includes: Dr. Isaac Kohane, who is a Professor of Pediatrics, directs the Children's Hospital Informatics Program and leads an NLM-supported national center for biomedical computing; Dr. Ron Kikinis who is a Professor at Harvard Medical School, and the Robert Greenes Distinguished Director of Biomedical Informatics in the Department of Radiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital; and Dr. John Quackenbush, who is a Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Professor of Cancer Biology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.     During the K22 award program, the applicant and his study team will develop informatics models and methods for Computational Pathology data. In Aim 1, they will develop a Computational Pathology Ontology to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase. The knowledgebase will be populated with microscopic phenotype data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data from over 2,500 cancer patients that underwent molecular profiling as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project. In Specific Aim 2, they will develop and apply methods in machine learning to identify associations between gene expression and microscopic phenotypes. This information will be incorporated into the C-Path Knowledgebase. In Aim 3, they will use the C-Path Knowledgebase to build integrative prognostic models that jointly model quantitative morphological data and quantitative gene expression data to predict patient survival. The integrative prognostic models generated in breast, brain, kidney, and lung cancer will lead to more effective diagnostics for these malignancies.     The central hypothesis for this application is that morphological and molecular data are inherently complementary, and the most biologically informative and clinically useful predictive models will incorporate information from both of these heterogeneous data types. This research will form the basis for an R01 application to further develop and validate the informatics methods and models developed in this project. Project Narrative: This project will develop new computational methods for modeling quantitative microscopic phenotype data and for integrating microscopic disease phenotypes with gene expression data and clinical outcomes data. These advances will lead to the development of improved diagnostics for patients, allowing clinicians to more accurately predict the outcome of a patient's disease, leading to more effective individualized therapies.",INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY,8887236,K22LM011931,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Israel', 'K22 Award', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer cell', 'cancer gene expression', 'cancer type', 'career', 'clinical care', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'improved', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'medical schools', 'model building', 'multitask', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'transcriptomics', 'translational medicine']",NLM,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K22,2015,151992,0.025818076111802327
"Predicted Gene Expression: High Power, Mechanism, and Direction of Effect ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although investments in genomic studies of mental disorders enabled the discovery of thousands of robustly associated variants with these complex diseases, the translation of these discoveries into actionable targets has been hampered by the lack of a mechanistic understanding on how genome variation relates to phenotype. Moreover, it has been widely shown that a substantial portion of the genetic control of complex traits, including mental disorders, is exerted through the regulation of gene expression. However, effective methods to fully harness this mechanism are lagging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel gene-based test -PrediXcan- that directly tests this regulatory mechanism and substantially improves power relative to single variant tests and other gene-based tests. PrediXcan is inherently mechanistic and provides directionality, highlighting its potential utility in identifying novel targets for therapy. The method consists of predicting the whole genome effect on expression traits and correlating this effect with disease risk to identify novel disease genes. In addition, we propose novel approaches to investigate the context-specificity of expression traits (Orthogonal Tissue Decomposition) and to quantify the collective effect of the regulated transcriptome on phenotypes of interest (Regulability). Regulability is similar to the concept of chip heritability (total variability explained collectivey by genotyped variants). First, we will develop cross-tissue, tissue-specific (for over 30 different human tissue types), and brain-region specific expression traits. We will use statistical machine learning methods to develop whole genome prediction models for these traits and extend this work to other molecular phenotypes. All models will be stored in open access databases. Next, we will apply the PrediXcan method to 7 mental disorder phenotypes. More specifically, we will compute genetically predicted levels of gene expression traits and correlate them with disease risk to identify genes involved in disease pathways. We will also quantify the collective effect of the predicted transcriptome (regulability) on mental disorder risk across multiple tissues. Finally we will extend PrediXcan method and develop a method to infer the results of PrediXcan using summary statistics data as opposed to individual level data. This will extend the applicability of the approach to all summary results generated by meta-analysis consortia and increase the power to discover novel genes given the larger sample sizes. The research we propose is driven by an extensive set of preliminary studies, and promises substantial deliverables in both new methods of analysis and public access results databases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large investments in genome studies have been made to understand the consequences of genetic variation on human traits. These have yielded many genetic variants reproducibly associated with disease but the underlying biology is still unclear.

"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease, which is not captured by the degree of airflow limitation measured by spirometry. One of the goals of the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD Study (COPDGene) is to define meaningful subgroups of COPD, leading to a new disease classification. These clinical and statistical approaches are utilizing the extensive phenotype data collected in COPDGene, including chest CT scans. The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will use RNA sequencing and miRNA for subtyping, different from the main COPDGene study. The hypothesis is that different COPD subtypes will have distinct pathophysiology, which can be identified through gene expression signatures, miRNA profiling and integrative genomics studies. Genomewide genotyping data can be used to test for associations with the subtypes. However, traditional genomewide association studies may be underpowered to detect subtype effects. Gene expression is an important intermediate phenotype between genotypes and complex traits, and can be easily assayed in peripheral blood. In this proposal, we will use expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting expression of differentially expressed genes and miRNAs. We will address the following Specific Aims: (1) Gene expression profiling in COPD subtypes: We will collect peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in COPDGene, perform RNA sequencing and miRNA profiling and test for differentially expressed transcripts and miRNAs for two clinical subtype comparisons: (A) emphysema-predominant vs. airway-predominant COPD and (B) frequent vs. infrequent acute exacerbations. We will validate the blood associations by RNA-sequencing in COPD lung tissue samples. (2) Molecular subtypes of COPD: We will use statistical and machine learning methods to define molecular subtypes based on the RNA sequencing and miRNA data. We will validate the molecular subtypes with the clinical, imaging and longitudinal follow-up data. (3) Integrative genomics of COPD subtypes: We will integrate the gene and miRNA expression data with genomewide SNP data to identify eQTL SNPs associated with transcript levels of the differentially expressed and subtype-defining genes and miRNAs from Aims 1 and Aim 2. The eQTL SNPs will be tested for association with the clinical subtypes in the full COPDGene Study population. This proposal will be distinct yet complement the parent COPDGene Study by using mRNA and miRNA expression data to identify genetic influences on COPD subtypes, which could identify biomarkers of disease subtypes or novel pathways and targets, moving towards the goal of precision medicine in COPD. The gene expression, miRNA and eQTL datasets will serve as resources for COPDGene and the community of COPD investigators.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ""Integrative Genomics of Clinical Subtypes in COPDGene"" study will allow us to find genes that are responsible for the specific type of COPD experienced by a patient. The information we learn may eventually lead to a more personalized approach to the diagnosis and treatment of COPD patients.            ",INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS OF CLINICAL SUBTYPES IN COPDGENE,8965166,R01HL125583,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Non-Malignant', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population Study', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spirometry', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Sample', 'Transcript', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'differential expression', 'disease classification', 'disease natural history', 'disorder subtype', 'exome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'precision medicine', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'response', 'small airways disease', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2015,911563,-0.004291550715833284
"Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular smooth muscle (SMC) phenotypic modulation, the transition from a contractile to a proliferative phenotype accompanied by neointima formation following vascular injury, plays a critical role in the development and progression of several proliferative cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. The regulatory mechanisms underlying SMC phenotypic modulation, however, are poorly understood. A hallmark feature of the phenotypic modulation is the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a well-known stimulator of SMC phenotypic modulation, down- regulates SMC gene expression and stimulates SMC proliferation via posttranscriptional regulation of the related genes. The post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in SMC phenotype gene expression, however, remain largely unknown. Our exciting preliminary data indicate that the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes is caused by abnormal RNA editing of their precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs). This abnormal pre-mRNA editing is facilitated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), which converts adenosines to inosines (A->I editing). A-to-I RNA editing of the pre-mRNA transcripts from introns or 3'-untranslated regions alters pre- mRNA splicing, leading to decreased mature mRNA levels and abnormal cellular functions. PDGF-BB induces ADAR1 while down-regulating SMC myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) and calponin (CNN). Knockdown of ADAR1 by shRNA restores PDGF-BB-blocked SMMHC and CNN expression, demonstrating that ADAR1 plays an essential role in SMC phenotype modulation. ADAR1 appears to be also important for PDGF-BB-induced SMC proliferation/survival. In vivo studies show that SMMHC and CNN pre-mRNA is accumulated when their mature mRNA is decreased in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Moreover, ADAR1 is highly induced in media layer SMCs initially, and neointima SMCs subsequently following the injury. Of importance, knockdown of ADAR1 dramatically inhibits injury-induced neointima formation, demonstrating a critical role of ADAR1 in vascular remodeling in vivo. These seminal findings strongly support a novel hypothesis that ADAR1/abnormal RNA editing mediates PDGF-BB-induced down-regulation of SMC contractile genes and SMC proliferation/survival, leading to SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling. Using primary culture of SMCs, in vivo rat balloon injury and mouse wire injury models combining with molecular, cellular and histological approaches, we will 1) determine the role and mechanism whereby ADAR1 modulates SMC phenotype; 2) elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ADAR1 function in regulating SMC proliferation/survival; and 3) study the role of ADAR1 in SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling in vivo. Successful completion of these aims will unravel a novel mechanism governing SMC phenotypic modulation, which will ultimately lead to identification of novel targets for developing therapeuti agents to treat proliferative vascular diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of mortality in the United States. Transition of vascular smooth muscle (SMC) from a differentiated phenotype to a proliferative state accompanied by neointima formation plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. In this application, a combination of molecular, cellular, and genetic approaches with gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies will be used to establish a novel mechanism underlying SMC phenotypic modulation. The completion of this project will advance our understanding of the fundamental pathologic mechanisms that contribute to the progression of aforementioned proliferative vascular diseases, and most importantly, lead to identification of important novel targets for developing therapeutic agents to treat these diseases.",Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling,8794466,R01HL119053,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'ADAR1', 'Adenosine', 'Angioplasty', 'Ants', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Cell physiology', 'Contractile Proteins', 'Contracts', 'DRADA2b protein', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypertension', 'Injury', 'Inosine', 'Introns', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lead', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Myosin Heavy Chains', 'Pathologic', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Smooth Muscle Myosins', 'Steno', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Proliferation', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Veins', 'calponin', 'dsRNA adenosine deaminase', 'gain of function', 'genetic approach', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Precursor', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neointima formation', 'novel', 'platelet-derived growth factor BB', 'protein expression', 'restenosis', 'small hairpin RNA', 'teration']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2015,368349,-0.025903646576158366

"Informatics Platform for Mammalian Gene Regulation at Isoform-level DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the notion of ""one gene makes one protein that functions in one signaling pathway"" in mammalian cells has been shown to be overly simplistic. Recent evidence suggests that more than 50% of the human genes produce multiple protein isoforms, through alternative splicing and alternative usage of transcription initiation and/or termination. Notably, the disruption of many of these genes is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders. For majority of human genes the resulting multiple protein isoforms are functionally different and can participate in different signaling pathways. However, nearly after a decade since the completion of the human genome draft sequence, we still assume ""gene"" as the basic functional unit in a cell. We argue that the isoform-level gene products - ""transcript variants"" and ""protein isoforms"" are the basic functional units in a mammalian cell, and accordingly, the informatics resources for managing and analyzing gene regulation data in mammalian cells should adopt ""gene isoform centric"" rather than ""gene centric"" approaches. We propose to build an informatics platform for understanding gene regulation at isoform-level by developing statistically rigorous bioinformatics resources for processing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Recently, computational approaches that combine seemingly disparate experimental data have been successful in developing concise gene regulation models and transcriptional modules. We plan to extend these methodologies to perform integrative analysis of multiple high-throughput data sets currently generated across different laboratories, including ours at Wistar, into computational models to predict different transcriptional isoforms of mammalian genes and protein-DNA interactions at isoform level. We will apply innovative statistical modeling approaches that combine state-of-the-art meta-classification algorithms, such as Na¿ve Bayes Tree, Bagging and LogitBoost, with Random Forest feature selection to classify different types of target promoters with good classification accuracy and reduced instability, in order to predict gene promoters and infer the protein-DNA interactions from ChIP-seq data. The computational models and the derived information will be integrated into a novel database, which will serve as an in silico platform for transcriptional regulation studies. This will be completed by pursuing the following aims, (1) Develop statistically rigorous novel algorithms and bioinformatics pipelines to identify the orthologous promoters, corresponding transcript variants and protein isoforms that are conserved between human and mouse, (2) develop novel algorithms and informatics pipelines for integrative analysis of NGS datasets to estimate the activity and expression of both known and novel promoters and their transcript variants, in various tissues, developmental stages, and disease conditions, and (3) develop a web-accessible database for integrating the information generated. The novel bioinformatics methods developed by this project will help in silico discovery and research for accelerating the linkage of phenotypic and genomic information, at gene-isoform level. Public health relevance statement:  The disruption of numerous human genes and their isoforms driven by alternative splicing and alternative transcription is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism. The development of bioinformatics methods and user-friendly  software in this study will provide useful tools to better understand gene regulatory mechanisms in mammalian cells, and more importantly, how dis-regulation of these mechanisms leads to a variety of diseases.",Informatics Platform for Mammalian Gene Regulation at Isoform-level,8843951,R01LM011297,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Arts', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA Polymerase II', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Fertility', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secure', 'Signal Pathway', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'TP53 gene', 'TP73 gene', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcription factor genes', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Trees', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer initiation', 'cost', 'epigenomics', 'forest', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neuropsychiatry', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web-accessible']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,337196,0.0017219652878855771
"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. These challenges call for novel statistical learning methods, especially for high dimensional and noisy data. The goal of this project is to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems. In particular, this project develops (1) novel techniques to assess statistical significance of clustering for high dimensional data; (2) several novel predictive models including classification and regression which are expected to yield highly competitive accuracy and interpretability; (3) new methods for high dimensional biomarker/variable selection; (4) new approaches to estimate high dimensional covariance/precision matrix for biological network construction. These new developments are expected to allow scientists to analyze complex cancer genomic data with accurate prediction accuracy and increased interpretability. The research team will apply the proposed techniques to cancer research data analysis. The success of this project will be important in bridging statistical machine learning and cancer research.

"Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heterotaxy, a birth defect involving randomized left-right patterning of visceral organs, is frequently associated with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), a reflection of the importance of left-right patterning in formation of asymmetries in the four-chamber heart. Heterotaxy (HTX) patients have unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. This may reflect the common requirement for motile cilia, both in embryonic left-right patterning and also mucus clearance in the airway. We recently showed 42% of HTX patients with CHD (HTX/CHD) have airway ciliary dysfunction (CD) similar to that of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a recessive disorder associated with laterality defects and sinopulmonary disease due to mucus clearance defects caused by immotile/dyskinetic cilia in the airway. Significantly, exome sequencing showed HTX patients with CD (HTX/CD) are enriched for novel/rare coding variants (RCV) in genes known to cause PCD and other cilia related genes. In this application, we will functionally assay 53 cilia candidate genes identified in 39 HTX/CD patients by exome sequencing analysis. We will assess the effects of gene knockdown on airway cilia motility using a novel assay with reciliating human airway epithelial cells. To assay gene function required for left-right patternin, antisense MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos will be carried out to examine heart and gut looping. Genes shown to disrupt airway cilia motility and cause HTX after knockdown will be further tested to determine whether the RCVs are pathogenic. Specifically we will examine whether expression of the RCV can rescue the HTX phenotype elicited by MO gene knockdown in the zebrafish embryo. Given all of the RCVs identified in HTX/CD patients were heterozygous, we hypothesize a multigenic model of disease, which will be tested by examining the phenotypes of double heterozygous mouse and zebrafish mutants with two-gene combinations observed in the HTX-CD patients. We will examine for evidence of digenic interactions by assaying motile cilia function and visceral organ situs in the double heterozygous mutants. These experiments will interrogate 8 digenic combinations that make use of 9 novel mouse mutants recovered from our ongoing mouse mutagenesis screen, and 7 other digenic combinations in zebrafish using existing mutant lines and de novo production of 4 zebrafish knockout lines by TALENs gene disruption. Finally, to establish genotype-phenotype correlation in ciliary motion defects, we will develop software for quantitative classification of ciliary motin defects using a computational approach with computer vision and machine learning algorithms for visual pattern recognition. Using this software, we will determine whether different RCVs are associated with different ciliary motion defects. This will provide insights into structure-functio relationships in the regulation of cilia motility. This software, to be made available as an online tool, will have translational potential for clinical evaluation of patient airway ciliary motion daa. Together, these studies will establish functional assays and software that can elucidate the genetic etiology of CHD/HTX.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients with heterodoxy, a birth defect involving abnormal left-right patterning, have some of the most complex congenital heart defects. Such patients exhibit unexplained higher morbidity and mortality, often with increased postsurgical respiratory complications. As motile cilia function is required both for airway mucus clearance and embryonic left-right patterning, we will develop functional assays and software to assess cilia candidate genes containing rare coding variants identified in heterodoxy patients for their role in airway cilia motility and left-right patterning of organ asymmetries.                ",Assaying Heterotaxy Patient Genes in Cilia Motility and Left-Right Patterning,8623176,R01GM104412,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cilia', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Embryo', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Handedness', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Knock-out', 'Left', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Situs Inversus', 'Structure', 'Structure of respiratory epithelium', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'Visceral', 'Visual Pattern Recognition', 'With laterality', 'Zebrafish', 'airway epithelium', 'cilium motility', 'congenital heart disorder', 'disease phenotype', 'exome sequencing', 'founder mutation', 'gene function', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'rare variant', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'software development', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,573774,0.0213825657761018
"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control. The successful completion of this project will significantly advance our ability to understand the gene regulation by miRNAs in a variety of normal physiological processes and disease states.

Here, we will compensate for an information deficit in various segments of experimental data (such as EST data) by unsupervised machine learning on existing and abundant data segments (an anonymous genomic sequence) with subsequent computational modeling of missing biological information (protein-coding genes and proteins). An important new feature of the self-training algorithm will be the utilization of protein level information to monitor and increase biological relevance of the models derived by the unsupervised iterative algorithm. Second, we will enhance the self-training algorithm developed earlier on a smaller scale and tested on fungal and other ""compact"" eukaryotic genomes (such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) to work with most complex eukaryotic genomes. At this higher level of complexity we see species with host genes occupying just a small fraction of genome which can be inhomogeneous in GC composition, populated with transposable elements and pseudogenes (besides animal genomes, genomes of some fungal pathogens as well as human parasites and their vectors fall into this category). Third, for the human microbiome containing bacterial, archaeal, viral and fungal species, situated at yet another end of the genome in homogeneity spectrum, we will develop improved algorithms and tools for ab initio gene identification. This work will be done in close contact with sequencing and annotation groups from leading genome centers both in the US and abroad. NARRATIVE Rational systems biology, cancer cure, vaccine development, drug design, is impossible without understanding genomic DNA in human cell. Gene prediction is a cornerstone of biological interpretation of DNA sequence. The goal of this proposal is developing automatic and accurate gene prediction algorithms for the most complex genomic sequences important for human health.",Gene Prediction by Markov Models and Complementary Methods,8909702,R01HG000783,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Drug Design', 'Employee Strikes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Eukaryota', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Haemophilus influenzae', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human Microbiome', 'Intercistronic Region', 'Introns', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Parasites', 'Population', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Pseudogenes', 'RNA Splicing', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Work', 'data mining', 'data structure', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'markov model', 'metagenome', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'pyrosequencing', 'research and development', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'vector']",NHGRI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2014,100000,0.005843874646323017
"Turning Data into Whole Cell Ontology Models for Functional Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A holy grail of bioinformatics is the creation of whole-cell models with the ability to enhance human understanding and facilitate discovery. To this end, a successful and widely-used effort is the Gene Ontology (GO), a massive project to manually annotate genes into terms describing molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components and provide relationships between terms, e.g. capturing that ""small ribosomal subunit"" and ""large ribosomal subunit"" come together to make ""ribosome"". GO is widely used to understand the function of a gene or group of genes. Unfortunately, GO is limited by the effort required to create and update it by hand. It exists only for well-studied organisms and even then in only one, generic form per organism with limited overall genome coverage and a bias towards well-studied genes and functions. It is not possible to learn about an uncharacterized gene or discover a new function using GO, and one cannot quickly assemble an ontology model for a new organism, let alone a specific cell-type or disease-state.  This proposed research will change this state of affairs. Already, work has shown that large networks of gene and protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be used to computationally infer an ontology whose coverage and power are equivalent to those of the manually-curated GO Cellular Component ontology. Still, this first attempt was limited in the types of experimental data used and its ability to infer the more generally useful Biological Process ontology. Here machine learning approaches will be applied to integrate many types of experimental data into ontology model construction and analyze the type of biological information provided by each experiment, revealing those experiments most informative for capturing Biological Process information. Furthermore, the high-throughput experimental data to ontology paradigm explored here will be used to develop a computational tool to highlight novel types of hypotheses that are inaccessible by current high-throughput experimental data analysis methods.  Preliminary work has shown GO to be useful for prediction of synthetic lethal pairs of genes, i.e. genes that are individually non-essential but when knocked out together cause cell death. Given the high mutation rate in cancer, these pairs provide potential cancer drug targets, as a drug may target a gene product which is now essential in the mutated cancer cells but not other cells, thereby killing only cancer cells. Because data-driven ontologies are not as hindered by issues with bias and coverage and are specifically designed to capture only functional relationships, this proposal will explore the idea that data-driven ontologies will be better suited to help predict synthetic lethal pairs than GO. To this end, algorithms will be developed to construct a data-driven ontology of yeast DNA repair and use this ontology to predict synthetic lethal pairs of genes.  Overall, this proposal will develop the computational and experimental roadmap to construct a whole-cell model of gene function - an ontology - and use the model to discover useful biology - synthetic lethal pairs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposal, a new framework for using the results of commonly performed, genome-wide experiments has the potential to create whole-cell models of gene function, similar to the widely-used Gene Ontology, directly from data without manual intervention. This will allow creation of useful models of cells from different organisms, tissues and diseases which researchers can use to discover the function of unstudied genes and to uncover new functions performed by the cell. Furthermore, this proposal will use these models for the discovery of new cancer drug targets called synthetic lethal pairs of genes.            ",Turning Data into Whole Cell Ontology Models for Functional Analysis,8644512,F30HG007618,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Processed Genes', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Update', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'biological information processing', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental analysis', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'killings', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F30,2014,35110,0.018158091354866995
"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposed research describes the engineering of novel polymers using combinatorial syntheses and cheminformatic modeling for enhanced transgene expression in cells. The efficacy and biocompatibility (toxicity) of polymers and combination treatments will be evaluated in vitro and in vivo (in mice).

"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbes that live in the human gut microbiota possess novel and ill-defined metabolic capabilities. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. Such solutes accumulate when the kidneys fail and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high level in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are three prominent uremic solutes that depend upon microbial metabolism of diet-derived molecules. Each exhibits inter-individual variability in the quantities produced, suggesting that microbiotas differ in their ability to produce these molecules. PCS and IS have been associated with poor outcomes in renal patients and TMAO has been linked to cardiovascular events in humans. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how the human gut microbiota may be modulated to decrease the production of these compounds. The main objectives are to elucidate (i) the microbial genes and species that are the key contributors to PCS, IS, and TMAO production; (ii) the impact of diet on the production of these solutes; and (iii) the best method for reprogramming a high-producing microbiota to a low-producing phenotype via administration of other gut-derived species. In Aim 1 a new machine learning software, ClusterFinder, will be used to query ~900 sequenced gut microbiota genomes to predict genes and gene cassettes that contribute to PCS, IS, or TMAO generation. Predictions will be validated in pure culture and in vivo, using a gnotobiotic mouse model in single and multiple species colonizations. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2 healthy omnivorous humans with stable high and low urinary TMAO, PCS and IS production will be identified. Microbiome-encoded genes and taxa associated with solute production phenotypes will be determined by analyzing stool samples for these individuals using 16S rRNA-based microbiota enumerations, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Aim 3 will address whether diet affects the production of TMAO, PCS, or IS using either gnotobiotic mice colonized with bacterial consortia validated in Aim 1, and a humanized mouse model, consisting of ex-germ-free mice colonized with the human fecal microbiota identified in Aim 2 of high- and low-producers of TMAO, PCS, or IS. Diets will include high vs. low fiber, high vs. low protein, or L-carnitine supplemented vs. vegetarian. Decreases in TMAO, PCS and/or IS production will be associated with changes in microbiota composition and function. Aim 4 will identify the most effective method for microbiota reprogramming in humanized mice to decrease TMAO, PCS and IS production using transplants of an intact microbiota, donor microbiota generated culture collections, or type strain representatives. The use of antibiotics before transplant and the influence of dietary reinforcement will be tested as methods of aiding microbiota reprogramming.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal defines how diet contributes to the production of these compounds and how the microbiota can be rationally altered to produce less of these compounds.            ",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,8817197,R01DK101674,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer software', 'Cresol', 'Cresols', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Indican', 'Individual', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Levocarnitine', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Transplantation', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Urine', 'Vegetarian diet', 'base', 'drug production', 'gut microbiota', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'solute', 'trimethyloxamine', 'urinary']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,727558,0.03680924617648766
"Multiscale Framework for Molecular Heterogeneity Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic profiling has become a routine practice in selecting treatments for many diseases, enabling the classification of patients into categories that associate with improved outcomes for specific treatments. One potential detractor to this approach is the tremendous heterogeneity in tissues used for profiling. Genomic classifications, obtained from a relatively small biopsy, are subject to influence from broad, regional variations in the affected tissue. Heterogeneity on a cellular scale can also obscure the target of treatment, as cells with distinct molecular profiles are homogenized in genomic profiling. Realizing better therapies will depend greatly on the ability to understand molecular heterogeneity within an individual, a challenge that necessitates new approaches to organize, analyze and integrate data from multiple spatial and molecular scales. This proposal describes an informatics framework to characterizing heterogeneity for tissue based studies. The framework will combine imaging informatics with genomics to describe molecular heterogeneity at multiple spatial and molecular scales. The imaging component will leverage a novel quantum dot technology that enables detailed mapping of multiple protein expression pathways within a single sample. Fluorescence in situ hybridization imaging will be used to measure DNA content. Whole-slide digitization will enable computer algorithms to capture molecular profiles of hundreds of millions of cells, calculating quantitative features to describe their expression patterns and DNA content. Biologically meaningful descriptions of each cell will be generated using a novel active machine learning classifier to annotate cells with an ontology describing molecular biology and cell anatomy, enabling slides to be analyzed in a biological context. Cell boundaries, features, and annotations will be integrated through the Pathology Analytic Imaging Standards (PAIS) database to provide support for data mining analysis. Mining methods will be developed to find the enrichment of cellular phenotypes, and to analyze the spatial layout of cells with respect to structures like blood vessels to discover the influence of the tissue microenvironment on key expression pathways in surrounding cells. These tools will be applied to studies of glioblastoma brain tumors, but are relevant for studies of other solid tissue diseases. The scientific study wil use tissues resected in a novel clinical trial that accurately defines the invading tumor margin, bulk and necrosis-rich core. Tissues will be analyzed for gene expression and imaging to generate a paired genomic-imaging profile for each region. Mining the imaging and gene expression profiles of these regions will identify intra-tumoral differences in cellular phenotypes and illustrate the extent of variation in genomic classifications. The paired imaging and gene expression profiles will also be mined to determine relationships between specific expression classes and the imaging observations to illustrate a complete picture of heterogeneity. A project repository will be deployed to disseminate images, analysis pipelines and analytic results. This repository will provide a public resource for brain tumor research and access to open source tools.

"INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY  Abstract The applicant is an Assistant Professor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School. The applicant's research program focuses on developing methods in translational bioinformatics to integrate heterogeneous biomedical data types (genomic, transcriptomic, microscopic, clinical) enabling the development of improved diagnostics and therapeutics for patients. Recent projects completed by the applicant include: the development of the Computational Pathology (C-Path) platform for building prognostic models from microscopic image data (Science Translational Medicine, 2011); and the development of the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures method for identifying robust prognostic gene expression signatures form clinically annotated genomic data (PLoS Computational Biology, 2013). This K22 award will provide the applicant with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert at designing and using ontologies to model Computational Pathology data and to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase; (2) to become an expert at integrative predictive modeling of Computational Pathology data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data; and (3) to develop and manage an independent research career in translational bioinformatics. To achieve these goals, the applicant has assembled a team of mentors and collaborators with expertise in each of these areas of translational biomedical informatics. The team includes: Dr Isaac Kohane, who is a Professor of Pediatrics, directs the Children's Hospital Informatics Program and leads an NLM-supported national center for biomedical computing; Dr Ron Kikinis who is a Professor at Harvard Medical School, and the Robert Greenes Distinguished Director of Biomedical Informatics in the Department of Radiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital; and Dr John Quackenbush, who is a Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Professor of Cancer Biology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. During the K22 award program, the applicant and his study team will develop informatics models and methods for Computational Pathology data. In Aim 1, they will develop a Computational Pathology Ontology to support a Computational Pathology Knowledgebase. The knowledgebase will be populated with microscopic phenotype data, gene expression data, and clinical outcomes data from over 2,500 cancer patients that underwent molecular profiling as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas project. In Specific Aim 2, they will develop and apply methods in machine learning to identify associations between gene expression and microscopic phenotypes. This information will be incorporated into the C-Path Knowledgebase. In Aim 3, they will use the C-Path Knowledgebase to build integrative prognostic models that jointly model quantitative morphological data and quantitative gene expression data to predict patient survival. The integrative prognostic models generated in breast, brain, kidney, and lung cancer will lead to more effective diagnostics for these malignancies. The central hypothesis for this application is that morphological and molecular data are inherently complementary, and the most biologically informative and clinically useful predictive models will incorporate information from both of these heterogeneous data types. This research will form the basis for an R01 application to further develop and validate the informatics methods and models developed in this project.  Project Narrative: This project will develop new computational methods for modeling quantitative microscopic phenotype data and for integrating microscopic disease phenotypes with gene expression data and clinical outcomes data. These advances will lead to the development of improved diagnostics for patients, allowing clinicians to more accurately predict the outcome of a patient's disease, leading to more effective individualized therapies.",INFORMATICS METHODS AND MODELS FOR COMPUTATIONAL PATHOLOGY,8674406,K22LM011931,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Israel', 'K22 Award', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer cell', 'cancer gene expression', 'cancer type', 'career', 'clinical care', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'improved', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'medical schools', 'multitask', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'transcriptomics', 'translational medicine']",NLM,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K22,2014,170586,0.025294233484578908
"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian  inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks.  We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during  breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and  disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is  unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process.  But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific  network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the  functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the  grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and  characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more  comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to  better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of  key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell  differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment  scheme.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1        The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.

"Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular smooth muscle (SMC) phenotypic modulation, the transition from a contractile to a proliferative phenotype accompanied by neointima formation following vascular injury, plays a critical role in the development and progression of several proliferative cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. The regulatory mechanisms underlying SMC phenotypic modulation, however, are poorly understood. A hallmark feature of the phenotypic modulation is the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a well-known stimulator of SMC phenotypic modulation, down- regulates SMC gene expression and stimulates SMC proliferation via posttranscriptional regulation of the related genes. The post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in SMC phenotype gene expression, however, remain largely unknown. Our exciting preliminary data indicate that the down-regulation of SMC contractile genes is caused by abnormal RNA editing of their precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs). This abnormal pre-mRNA editing is facilitated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), which converts adenosines to inosines (A->I editing). A-to-I RNA editing of the pre-mRNA transcripts from introns or 3'-untranslated regions alters pre- mRNA splicing, leading to decreased mature mRNA levels and abnormal cellular functions. PDGF-BB induces ADAR1 while down-regulating SMC myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) and calponin (CNN). Knockdown of ADAR1 by shRNA restores PDGF-BB-blocked SMMHC and CNN expression, demonstrating that ADAR1 plays an essential role in SMC phenotype modulation. ADAR1 appears to be also important for PDGF-BB-induced SMC proliferation/survival. In vivo studies show that SMMHC and CNN pre-mRNA is accumulated when their mature mRNA is decreased in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Moreover, ADAR1 is highly induced in media layer SMCs initially, and neointima SMCs subsequently following the injury. Of importance, knockdown of ADAR1 dramatically inhibits injury-induced neointima formation, demonstrating a critical role of ADAR1 in vascular remodeling in vivo. These seminal findings strongly support a novel hypothesis that ADAR1/abnormal RNA editing mediates PDGF-BB-induced down-regulation of SMC contractile genes and SMC proliferation/survival, leading to SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling. Using primary culture of SMCs, in vivo rat balloon injury and mouse wire injury models combining with molecular, cellular and histological approaches, we will 1) determine the role and mechanism whereby ADAR1 modulates SMC phenotype; 2) elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ADAR1 function in regulating SMC proliferation/survival; and 3) study the role of ADAR1 in SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling in vivo. Successful completion of these aims will unravel a novel mechanism governing SMC phenotypic modulation, which will ultimately lead to identification of novel targets for developing therapeuti agents to treat proliferative vascular diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of mortality in the United States. Transition of vascular smooth muscle (SMC) from a differentiated phenotype to a proliferative state accompanied by neointima formation plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis after angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, and transplantation arteriopathy. In this application, a combination of molecular, cellular, and genetic approaches with gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies will be used to establish a novel mechanism underlying SMC phenotypic modulation. The completion of this project will advance our understanding of the fundamental pathologic mechanisms that contribute to the progression of aforementioned proliferative vascular diseases, and most importantly, lead to identification of important novel targets for developing therapeutic agents to treat these diseases.            ",Novel mechanism of smooth muscle phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling,8653749,R01HL119053,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'ADAR1', 'Adenosine', 'Angioplasty', 'Ants', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Cell physiology', 'Contractile Proteins', 'Contracts', 'DRADA2b protein', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypertension', 'Injury', 'Inosine', 'Introns', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lead', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Myosin Heavy Chains', 'Pathologic', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Smooth Muscle Myosins', 'Steno', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Proliferation', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Veins', 'calponin', 'dsRNA adenosine deaminase', 'gain of function', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Precursor', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neointima formation', 'novel', 'platelet-derived growth factor BB', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'restenosis', 'small hairpin RNA', 'teration']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2014,372500,-0.025903646576158366

"Modeling MicroRNA-Target Functional Networks for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Prognosis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of adult hematopoietic malignancy. It has a high rate of disease relapse, a consequence of chemoresistance. Recent biological studies suggest that a major component of the relapse phenotype resides in a rare population of leukemic stem cells (LSC), characterized by extensive proliferative and self-renewal potential, and poor response to standard chemotherapeutic agents. We hypothesize that i) common molecular characteristics inherent to LSC-enriched populations reflect the biology of heterogeneous AML with unfavorable prognostic features; ii) these associations can be derived from systematic analysis of gene and microRNA expression profiles, and other biologic characteristics of bulk AML samples. The overarching goal of this project is to define LSC-characterized transcription factor (TF) and microRNA interactions in heterogeneous AMLs. We proposed to integrate both qualified data-driven and curated knowledge about LSC characteristics, and clinical outcomes from bulk AML. Specifically, we will perform meta-analyses on a pathway level to build LSC-specific biology, focusing on AML prognostic TF/microRNA deregulation. These approaches are supported by our two pioneering mathematical methodologies: the Functional Analysis of Individual Microarray Expression (FAIME) and the mechanism-anchored Phenotypes-Genotype Network (PGNet). FAIME provides a novel process for transforming extensive available gene expression profiles into individual pathway profiles, resulting in more reproducible pathway signatures (46% overlap among three cohorts, empirical p<0.001). The PGNet method reveals genes regulated by disease-critical regulators and can accurately predict patient outcomes - shifting the paradigm from single gene/microRNA analysis towards ""mechanism anchored profiling"". Using PGNet, we have successfully predicted that the epigenetic regulator HDAC9 is associated with survival in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Innovatively, this project will interrogate microRNAs/genes that regulate LSC-specific biological pathways and AML prognostication, integrating regulator-regulator interactions and regulator-gene interactions. In Aim 1, we will build LSC-specific gene pathways and identify regulator-gene interactions. In Aim 2, we will correlate LSC-specific regulators and their target genes corresponding to AML outcomes. In Aim 3, we will develop novel approaches to computationally model the crucial interactions among the LSC-specific regulators and prognostic gene targets. Both the abundance of available AML patient profiles and the proven ability of our proposed methods suggest that we will achieve our aim to build an LSC-driven prognostic model.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have long been committed to the development of statistical algorithms and software tools for high-throughput data analyses (e.g. the Bioconductor package OrderedList, the online tools GOModule). These tools allow an effective functional integration of transcriptome information with clinical endpoints. This project will systematically build a pre-clinical model of the leukemic stem cell, a critical subpopulation in acute myeloid leukemia that integrates transcriptome, crucial microRNAs, targeting genes, and other biologic/clinical endpoints. This robust computational structure will facilitate predictions f outcomes and the identification of key oncogenic targets.            ",Modeling MicroRNA-Target Functional Networks for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Prognosis,8688175,R21CA167305,"['Accounting', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Back', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioconductor', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blast Cell', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Karyotype', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncogenic', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Qualifying', 'Reading', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Transcription factor genes', 'Translating', 'Yang', 'base', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'feeding', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'leukemia', 'leukemic stem cell', 'mathematical methods', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'stemness', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2014,166670,0.047164174788226834
"Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics, and Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics and Biomarkers, responds to RFA-MH-12-020, entitled Integrating Multi-Dimensional Data to Explore Mechanisms Underlying Mental Disorders. By bringing together experts in neuroimaging, genetics, and mathematics, we plan to create an advanced, portable framework to combine diverse biomedical data from 3D neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid/FDG-PET), gene expression networks, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other multidimensional data (e.g., physiological biomarkers, epigenetic data, etc.). Our overall goal is to improve diagnosis and prognosis of disease by combining multiple levels of biological information (personalized medicine). In doing so, novel mathematical tools will automatically discover which biomarkers are most helpful in different contexts. To discover and test relationships between very high-dimensional measures (such as images and genomes), we use novel concepts for data reduction such as penalized regression (elastic nets), adaptive hierarchical clustering, Bayesian networks, and support vector machines. Avoiding the limitations of current work that tests individual gene effects independently, we extend the analysis of gene expression networks to images, to relate signs of disease to their genetic underpinnings and to all available biomarkers. Aim 1 empowers discovery genetic variants (identified in GWAS, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing) that modulate measures of disease. We will use compressive coding models to discover and verify which sets of genetic variants affect multidimensional images (e.g., co-registered MRI & PET, DTI). We will verify our predictions using k-fold cross-validation and independent replications in new samples and controllable test data. Aim 2 extends our work using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) from single traits to entire databases of 3D images (MRI/PET). Our framework will merge GWAS, eQTL analysis, and expression-phenotype analysis but will be broadly applicable to any future high-throughput biological information (e.g. methylation profiles, DTI, fMRI). In Aim 3, we will quantify the added predictive value derivable from genotyping, gene expression profiling, and multimodal neuroimaging for personalized prognosis and diagnosis. For example, which biomarkers (gene expression, CSF, MRI) are most useful in which cases? To maximize impact of this effort, we and our collaborators will test our tools on existing and new datasets from a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism (see Support Letters). All tools will be disseminated and linked to web-accessible databases that store and ease access to high-throughput genetic, genomic, and imaging datasets.          Our project improves diagnosis and predictions of patient outcomes by integrating diverse types of patient data including neuroimaging, gene expression profiles, cognitive, and behavioral markers of disease diagnosis, progression, and treatment response. To tackle these complex data types, we develop novel machine learning, network analysis, and database methods. Our personalized medicine approach will help researchers study and evaluate neurological and psychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism.

"Informatics platform for mammalian gene regulation at isoform-level     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the notion of ""one gene makes one protein that functions in one signaling pathway"" in mammalian cells has been shown to be overly simplistic. Recent evidence suggests that more than 50% of the human genes produce multiple protein isoforms, through alternative splicing and alternative usage of transcription initiation and/or termination. Notably, the disruption of many of these genes is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders. For majority of human genes the resulting multiple protein isoforms are functionally different and can participate in different signaling pathways. However, nearly after a decade since the completion of the human genome draft sequence, we still assume ""gene"" as the basic functional unit in a cell. We argue that the isoform-level gene products - ""transcript variants"" and ""protein isoforms"" are the basic functional units in a mammalian cell, and accordingly, the informatics resources for managing and analyzing gene regulation data in mammalian cells should adopt ""gene isoform centric"" rather than ""gene centric"" approaches. We propose to build an informatics platform for understanding gene regulation at isoform-level by developing statistically rigorous bioinformatics resources for processing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Recently, computational approaches that combine seemingly disparate experimental data have been successful in developing concise gene regulation models and transcriptional modules. We plan to extend these methodologies to perform integrative analysis of multiple high-throughput data sets currently generated across different laboratories, including ours at Wistar, into computational models to predict different transcriptional isoforms of mammalian genes and protein-DNA interactions at isoform level. We will apply innovative statistical modeling approaches that combine state-of-the-art meta-classification algorithms, such as Na¿ve Bayes Tree, Bagging and LogitBoost, with Random Forest feature selection to classify different types of target promoters with good classification accuracy and reduced instability, in order to predict gene promoters and infer the protein-DNA interactions from ChIP-seq data. The computational models and the derived information will be integrated into a novel database, which will serve as an in silico platform for transcriptional regulation studies. This will be completed by pursuing the following aims, (1) Develop statistically rigorous novel algorithms and bioinformatics pipelines to identify the orthologous promoters, corresponding transcript variants and protein isoforms that are conserved between human and mouse, (2) develop novel algorithms and informatics pipelines for integrative analysis of NGS datasets to estimate the activity and expression of both known and novel promoters and their transcript variants, in various tissues, developmental stages, and disease conditions, and (3) develop a web-accessible database for integrating the information generated.

"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. These challenges call for novel statistical learning methods, especially for high dimensional and noisy data. The goal of this project is to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems. In particular, this project develops (1) novel techniques to assess statistical significance of clustering for high dimensional data; (2) several novel predictive models including classification and regression which are expected to yield highly competitive accuracy and interpretability; (3) new methods for high dimensional biomarker/variable selection; (4) new approaches to estimate high dimensional covariance/precision matrix for biological network construction. These new developments are expected to allow scientists to analyze complex cancer genomic data with accurate prediction accuracy and increased interpretability. The research team will apply the proposed techniques to cancer research data analysis. The success of this project will be important in bridging statistical machine learning and cancer research.

"Computational Methods for Expression Image Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in high-throughput bio-imaging technologies are enabling scientists to capture the spatio- temporal patterns of gene expression in cells, organs and individuals in efforts to generate a more comprehensive picture of genome function. Today, images capturing gene expression and protein localization patterns have unprecedented spatial resolution, resulting in high-quality maps (expression images) in model organisms. However, computational biology of gene expression patterns lags far behind genome informatics. Automated and efficient tools for analyzing expression images are a prerequisite for generating biological insights into gene functions, interactions and networks for the next generation of scientists. This project focuses on the development of novel tools and techniques for large-scale biological annotation and comparative analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of a model organism (Drosophila melanogaster; the fruit fly). This choice is important because the fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals. The availability of >100,000 images that capture gene expression patterns, provides an opportunity to examine the similarities and differences in the expression of the developing embryos of fruit fly genes, many of which show a very high sequence and biochemical function similarity to humans proteins. Three primary aims of the proposed research are as follows: (a) Develop machine learning methods that will use the existing, but coarse, knowledge in training, and will produce refined and new stage information for existing and future images. The knowledge of the precise developmental stage is important because it enables the biologically-meaningful mining of genes with similar spatial patterns, calculating the developmental trajectories of gene expressions, facilitating stage-sensitive textual annotation of expressions captured in images, and building genome-wide expression pattern maps at critical junctures in development. (b) Develop machine learning methods to describe expression patterns in words by using the existing controlled vocabulary. These descriptions will enable the use of efficient text-mining tools to identify genes expressed in similar organs and their precursors. These descriptions will also provide a better comparison of expression patterns across species, because many efforts in the scientific community relate organism specific controlled vocabularies with each other. (c) Develop transfer learning techniques for stage and text annotation that can be used for images generated from future techniques. This is important because traditionally, machine learning approaches assume that the training data and test data are drawn from the same distribution. However, new bio-imaging techniques are producing higher resolution data with substantially different color and intensity distributions, and robust methods that apply across techniques are desired.           Project Narrative This project focuses on the analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster. This fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.          We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). This screen will be used to identify therapeutic compounds that can be used to treat DM1.

"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control. The successful completion of this project will significantly advance our ability to understand the gene regulation by miRNAs in a variety of normal physiological processes and disease states.

"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases.

"Multiscale Framework for Molecular Heterogeneity Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genomic profiling has become a routine practice in selecting treatments for many diseases, enabling the classification of patients into categories that associate with improved outcomes for specific treatments. One potential detractor to this approach is the tremendous heterogeneity in tissues used for profiling. Genomic classifications, obtained from a relatively small biopsy, are subject to influence from broad, regional variations in the affected tissue. Heterogeneity on a cellular scale can also obscure the target of treatment, as cells with distinct molecular profiles are homogenized in genomic profiling. Realizing better therapies will depend greatly on the ability to understand molecular heterogeneity within an individual, a challenge that necessitates new approaches to organize, analyze and integrate data from multiple spatial and molecular scales. This proposal describes an informatics framework to characterizing heterogeneity for tissue based studies. The framework will combine imaging informatics with genomics to describe molecular heterogeneity at multiple spatial and molecular scales. The imaging component will leverage a novel quantum dot technology that enables detailed mapping of multiple protein expression pathways within a single sample. Fluorescence in situ hybridization imaging will be used to measure DNA content. Whole-slide digitization will enable computer algorithms to capture molecular profiles of hundreds of millions of cells, calculating quantitative features to describe their expression patterns and DNA content. Biologically meaningful descriptions of each cell will be generated using a novel active machine learning classifier to annotate cells with an ontology describing molecular biology and cell anatomy, enabling slides to be analyzed in a biological context. Cell boundaries, features, and annotations will be integrated through the Pathology Analytic Imaging Standards (PAIS) database to provide support for data mining analysis. Mining methods will be developed to find the enrichment of cellular phenotypes, and to analyze the spatial layout of cells with respect to structures like blood vessels to discover the influence of the tissue microenvironment on key expression pathways in surrounding cells. These tools will be applied to studies of glioblastoma brain tumors, but are relevant for studies of other solid tissue diseases. The scientific study wil use tissues resected in a novel clinical trial that accurately defines the invading tumor margin, bulk and necrosis-rich core. Tissues will be analyzed for gene expression and imaging to generate a paired genomic-imaging profile for each region. Mining the imaging and gene expression profiles of these regions will identify intra-tumoral differences in cellular phenotypes and illustrate the extent of variation in genomic classifications. The paired imaging and gene expression profiles will also be mined to determine relationships between specific expression classes and the imaging observations to illustrate a complete picture of heterogeneity. A project repository will be deployed to disseminate images, analysis pipelines and analytic results. This repository will provide a public resource for brain tumor research and access to open source tools.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE Developing effective treatments for disease requires an understanding of their molecular mechanisms.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian  inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks.  We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during  breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and  disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is  unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process.  But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific  network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the  functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the  grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and  characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more  comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to  better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of  key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell  differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment  scheme.

"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1        The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.

"Context-Sensitive Search of Human Expression Compendia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression experiments are an abundant and robust source of functional genomics data, with thousands of microarray and a growing number of high throughput RNA sequencing studies publicly available, most interrogating clinical and biological systems relevant to disease. They hold the promise of data-driven characterization of gene function and regulation, including in specific tissues, cell lines, and disease states, and can advance the understanding and modeling of regulatory changes that form the basis of human disease. However, these data remain largely underutilized, as biology researchers do not have effective tools to explore and analyze the entire data collection to generate novel hypotheses and direct experiments. The situation is similar to that of the Internet before the search engines - a biology researcher has to know a priori which datasets pertain to the biological question she is asking, reflect the tissue/cell-lineage specific signals of interest to her, and accurately measure the expression of genes related to her pathways of interest. There is a clear need for methods that will enable biology researchers to use their domain-specific knowledge to direct their exploration of public human expression data, enabling them to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing challenging biomedical questions. Such a system should provide users with ability to effectively explore automatically identified datasets relevant to their biological question of interest, leverage metazoan complexity including cell lineage and disease specific signals, and allow the researcher to securely include their unpublished data in the analysis. To address these challenges, this proposal describes a ""Google-style"" public search engine for large collections of gene expression data built using novel search algorithms and leveraging cloud-computing technologies. This system implements a novel query-based context-sensitive algorithm for search of large expression compendia that exploits the complexity of metazoan organisms, including cell-lineage complexity and disease aspects inherent to human expression studies. Furthermore, the challenge of heterogeneity in human samples will be addressed by developing novel hierarchical learning methods to predict cell-lineage or tissue-specific gene expression based on the compendium and to identify these signals in each dataset. This will enable users to explore tissue-specific expression and also will be integrated with the search algorithm to improve search accuracy. Proposed algorithms, search engine, and user interface will be extensively evaluated in close collaboration with biology researchers, and top predictions will be tested experimentally. These methods will be implemented in a user-friendly public search system that will leverage cloud computing to provide robust interactive query response and will enable biology researchers to explore both published data collections and their own pre-publication datasets in a context-specific, integrated, and secure manner.        We will develop a ""Google-style"" search engine for massive collections of human gene expression data. Our system will enable researchers to use their domain knowledge to explore the entirety of public human expression data to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing a diverse range of challenging biomedical questions. Public availability of our system will advance genome-level understanding of human biology and facilitate development of novel drugs, therapies, and personalized medical treatments.

"Modeling MicroRNA-Target Functional Networks for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Prognosis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of adult hematopoietic malignancy. It has a high rate of disease relapse, a consequence of chemoresistance. Recent biological studies suggest that a major component of the relapse phenotype resides in a rare population of leukemic stem cells (LSC), characterized by extensive proliferative and self-renewal potential, and poor response to standard chemotherapeutic agents. We hypothesize that i) common molecular characteristics inherent to LSC-enriched populations reflect the biology of heterogeneous AML with unfavorable prognostic features; ii) these associations can be derived from systematic analysis of gene and microRNA expression profiles, and other biologic characteristics of bulk AML samples. The overarching goal of this project is to define LSC-characterized transcription factor (TF) and microRNA interactions in heterogeneous AMLs. We proposed to integrate both qualified data-driven and curated knowledge about LSC characteristics, and clinical outcomes from bulk AML. Specifically, we will perform meta-analyses on a pathway level to build LSC-specific biology, focusing on AML prognostic TF/microRNA deregulation. These approaches are supported by our two pioneering mathematical methodologies: the Functional Analysis of Individual Microarray Expression (FAIME) and the mechanism-anchored Phenotypes-Genotype Network (PGNet). FAIME provides a novel process for transforming extensive available gene expression profiles into individual pathway profiles, resulting in more reproducible pathway signatures (46% overlap among three cohorts, empirical p<0.001). The PGNet method reveals genes regulated by disease-critical regulators and can accurately predict patient outcomes - shifting the paradigm from single gene/microRNA analysis towards ""mechanism anchored profiling"". Using PGNet, we have successfully predicted that the epigenetic regulator HDAC9 is associated with survival in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Innovatively, this project will interrogate microRNAs/genes that regulate LSC-specific biological pathways and AML prognostication, integrating regulator-regulator interactions and regulator-gene interactions. In Aim 1, we will build LSC-specific gene pathways and identify regulator-gene interactions. In Aim 2, we will correlate LSC-specific regulators and their target genes corresponding to AML outcomes. In Aim 3, we will develop novel approaches to computationally model the crucial interactions among the LSC-specific regulators and prognostic gene targets. Both the abundance of available AML patient profiles and the proven ability of our proposed methods suggest that we will achieve our aim to build an LSC-driven prognostic model.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have long been committed to the development of statistical algorithms and software tools for high-throughput data analyses (e.g. the Bioconductor package OrderedList, the online tools GOModule). These tools allow an effective functional integration of transcriptome information with clinical endpoints. This project will systematically build a pre-clinical model of the leukemic stem cell, a critical subpopulation in acute myeloid leukemia that integrates transcriptome, crucial microRNAs, targeting genes, and other biologic/clinical endpoints. This robust computational structure will facilitate predictions f outcomes and the identification of key oncogenic targets.            ",Modeling MicroRNA-Target Functional Networks for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Prognosis,8583454,R21CA167305,"['Accounting', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioconductor', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blast Cell', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Karyotype', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncogenic', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Qualifying', 'Reading', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Models', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Transcription factor genes', 'Translating', 'Yang', 'base', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'feeding', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'leukemia', 'leukemic stem cell', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'stemness', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2013,203415,0.047164174788226834
"Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics, and Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics and Biomarkers, responds to RFA-MH-12-020, entitled Integrating Multi-Dimensional Data to Explore Mechanisms Underlying Mental Disorders. By bringing together experts in neuroimaging, genetics, and mathematics, we plan to create an advanced, portable framework to combine diverse biomedical data from 3D neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid/FDG-PET), gene expression networks, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other multidimensional data (e.g., physiological biomarkers, epigenetic data, etc.). Our overall goal is to improve diagnosis and prognosis of disease by combining multiple levels of biological information (personalized medicine). In doing so, novel mathematical tools will automatically discover which biomarkers are most helpful in different contexts. To discover and test relationships between very high-dimensional measures (such as images and genomes), we use novel concepts for data reduction such as penalized regression (elastic nets), adaptive hierarchical clustering, Bayesian networks, and support vector machines. Avoiding the limitations of current work that tests individual gene effects independently, we extend the analysis of gene expression networks to images, to relate signs of disease to their genetic underpinnings and to all available biomarkers. Aim 1 empowers discovery genetic variants (identified in GWAS, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing) that modulate measures of disease. We will use compressive coding models to discover and verify which sets of genetic variants affect multidimensional images (e.g., co-registered MRI & PET, DTI). We will verify our predictions using k-fold cross-validation and independent replications in new samples and controllable test data. Aim 2 extends our work using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) from single traits to entire databases of 3D images (MRI/PET). Our framework will merge GWAS, eQTL analysis, and expression-phenotype analysis but will be broadly applicable to any future high-throughput biological information (e.g. methylation profiles, DTI, fMRI). In Aim 3, we will quantify the added predictive value derivable from genotyping, gene expression profiling, and multimodal neuroimaging for personalized prognosis and diagnosis. For example, which biomarkers (gene expression, CSF, MRI) are most useful in which cases? To maximize impact of this effort, we and our collaborators will test our tools on existing and new datasets from a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism (see Support Letters). All tools will be disseminated and linked to web-accessible databases that store and ease access to high-throughput genetic, genomic, and imaging datasets.          Our project improves diagnosis and predictions of patient outcomes by integrating diverse types of patient data including neuroimaging, gene expression profiles, cognitive, and behavioral markers of disease diagnosis, progression, and treatment response. To tackle these complex data types, we develop novel machine learning, network analysis, and database methods. Our personalized medicine approach will help researchers study and evaluate neurological and psychiatric conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism.

"Informatics platform for mammalian gene regulation at isoform-level     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the notion of ""one gene makes one protein that functions in one signaling pathway"" in mammalian cells has been shown to be overly simplistic. Recent evidence suggests that more than 50% of the human genes produce multiple protein isoforms, through alternative splicing and alternative usage of transcription initiation and/or termination. Notably, the disruption of many of these genes is implicated in cancer and several neuropsychiatric disorders. For majority of human genes the resulting multiple protein isoforms are functionally different and can participate in different signaling pathways. However, nearly after a decade since the completion of the human genome draft sequence, we still assume ""gene"" as the basic functional unit in a cell. We argue that the isoform-level gene products - ""transcript variants"" and ""protein isoforms"" are the basic functional units in a mammalian cell, and accordingly, the informatics resources for managing and analyzing gene regulation data in mammalian cells should adopt ""gene isoform centric"" rather than ""gene centric"" approaches. We propose to build an informatics platform for understanding gene regulation at isoform-level by developing statistically rigorous bioinformatics resources for processing Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Recently, computational approaches that combine seemingly disparate experimental data have been successful in developing concise gene regulation models and transcriptional modules. We plan to extend these methodologies to perform integrative analysis of multiple high-throughput data sets currently generated across different laboratories, including ours at Wistar, into computational models to predict different transcriptional isoforms of mammalian genes and protein-DNA interactions at isoform level. We will apply innovative statistical modeling approaches that combine state-of-the-art meta-classification algorithms, such as Na¿ve Bayes Tree, Bagging and LogitBoost, with Random Forest feature selection to classify different types of target promoters with good classification accuracy and reduced instability, in order to predict gene promoters and infer the protein-DNA interactions from ChIP-seq data. The computational models and the derived information will be integrated into a novel database, which will serve as an in silico platform for transcriptional regulation studies. This will be completed by pursuing the following aims, (1) Develop statistically rigorous novel algorithms and bioinformatics pipelines to identify the orthologous promoters, corresponding transcript variants and protein isoforms that are conserved between human and mouse, (2) develop novel algorithms and informatics pipelines for integrative analysis of NGS datasets to estimate the activity and expression of both known and novel promoters and their transcript variants, in various tissues, developmental stages, and disease conditions, and (3) develop a web-accessible database for integrating the information generated.

"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. These challenges call for novel statistical learning methods, especially for high dimensional and noisy data. The goal of this project is to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems. In particular, this project develops (1) novel techniques to assess statistical significance of clustering for high dimensional data; (2) several novel predictive models including classification and regression which are expected to yield highly competitive accuracy and interpretability; (3) new methods for high dimensional biomarker/variable selection; (4) new approaches to estimate high dimensional covariance/precision matrix for biological network construction. These new developments are expected to allow scientists to analyze complex cancer genomic data with accurate prediction accuracy and increased interpretability. The research team will apply the proposed techniques to cancer research data analysis. The success of this project will be important in bridging statistical machine learning and cancer research.

"Computational Methods for Expression Image Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in high-throughput bio-imaging technologies are enabling scientists to capture the spatio- temporal patterns of gene expression in cells, organs and individuals in efforts to generate a more comprehensive picture of genome function. Today, images capturing gene expression and protein localization patterns have unprecedented spatial resolution, resulting in high-quality maps (expression images) in model organisms. However, computational biology of gene expression patterns lags far behind genome informatics. Automated and efficient tools for analyzing expression images are a prerequisite for generating biological insights into gene functions, interactions and networks for the next generation of scientists. This project focuses on the development of novel tools and techniques for large-scale biological annotation and comparative analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of a model organism (Drosophila melanogaster; the fruit fly). This choice is important because the fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals. The availability of >100,000 images that capture gene expression patterns, provides an opportunity to examine the similarities and differences in the expression of the developing embryos of fruit fly genes, many of which show a very high sequence and biochemical function similarity to humans proteins. Three primary aims of the proposed research are as follows: (a) Develop machine learning methods that will use the existing, but coarse, knowledge in training, and will produce refined and new stage information for existing and future images. The knowledge of the precise developmental stage is important because it enables the biologically-meaningful mining of genes with similar spatial patterns, calculating the developmental trajectories of gene expressions, facilitating stage-sensitive textual annotation of expressions captured in images, and building genome-wide expression pattern maps at critical junctures in development. (b) Develop machine learning methods to describe expression patterns in words by using the existing controlled vocabulary. These descriptions will enable the use of efficient text-mining tools to identify genes expressed in similar organs and their precursors. These descriptions will also provide a better comparison of expression patterns across species, because many efforts in the scientific community relate organism specific controlled vocabularies with each other. (c) Develop transfer learning techniques for stage and text annotation that can be used for images generated from future techniques. This is important because traditionally, machine learning approaches assume that the training data and test data are drawn from the same distribution. However, new bio-imaging techniques are producing higher resolution data with substantially different color and intensity distributions, and robust methods that apply across techniques are desired.           Project Narrative This project focuses on the analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster. This fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.          We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). This screen will be used to identify therapeutic compounds that can be used to treat DM1.

"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control. The successful completion of this project will significantly advance our ability to understand the gene regulation by miRNAs in a variety of normal physiological processes and disease states.

"Gene Prediction by Markov Models and Complementary Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the ab initio self-training algorithms for eukaryotic gene finding developed in the previous grant period in several important directions. First we will upgrade this algorithm to a multilevel data mining approach to allow construction of a consistent ""genome- transcriptome-proteome"" data structure at the early stages of a genome project. Here, we will compensate for an information deficit in various segments of experimental data (such as EST data) by unsupervised machine learning on existing and abundant data segments (an anonymous genomic sequence) with subsequent computational modeling of missing biological information (protein-coding genes and proteins). An important new feature of the self-training algorithm will be the utilization of protein level information to monitor and increase biological relevance of the models derived by the unsupervised iterative algorithm. Second, we will enhance the self-training algorithm developed earlier on a smaller scale and tested on fungal and other ""compact"" eukaryotic genomes (such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) to work with most complex eukaryotic genomes. At this higher level of complexity we see species with host genes occupying just a small fraction of genome which can be inhomogeneous in GC composition, populated with transposable elements and pseudogenes (besides animal genomes, genomes of some fungal pathogens as well as human parasites and their vectors fall into this category).

"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian  inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks.  We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during  breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and  disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is  unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process.  But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific  network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the  functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the  grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and  characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more  comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to  better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of  key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell  differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment  scheme.

"Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics, and Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, Empowering Personalized Medicine: Integrating Imaging, Genetics and Biomarkers, responds to RFA-MH-12-020, entitled Integrating Multi-Dimensional Data to Explore Mechanisms Underlying Mental Disorders. By bringing together experts in neuroimaging, genetics, and mathematics, we plan to create an advanced, portable framework to combine diverse biomedical data from 3D neuroimaging (MRI, amyloid/FDG-PET), gene expression networks, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other multidimensional data (e.g., physiological biomarkers, epigenetic data, etc.). Our overall goal is to improve diagnosis and prognosis of disease by combining multiple levels of biological information (personalized medicine). In doing so, novel mathematical tools will automatically discover which biomarkers are most helpful in different contexts. To discover and test relationships between very high-dimensional measures (such as images and genomes), we use novel concepts for data reduction such as penalized regression (elastic nets), adaptive hierarchical clustering, Bayesian networks, and support vector machines. Avoiding the limitations of current work that tests individual gene effects independently, we extend the analysis of gene expression networks to images, to relate signs of disease to their genetic underpinnings and to all available biomarkers. Aim 1 empowers discovery genetic variants (identified in GWAS, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing) that modulate measures of disease. We will use compressive coding models to discover and verify which sets of genetic variants affect multidimensional images (e.g., co-registered MRI & PET, DTI). We will verify our predictions using k-fold cross-validation and independent replications in new samples and controllable test data. Aim 2 extends our work using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) from single traits to entire databases of 3D images (MRI/PET). Our framework will merge GWAS, eQTL analysis, and expression-phenotype analysis but will be broadly applicable to any future high-throughput biological information (e.g. methylation profiles, DTI, fMRI). In Aim 3, we will quantify the added predictive value derivable from genotyping, gene expression profiling, and multimodal neuroimaging for personalized prognosis and diagnosis. For example, which biomarkers (gene expression, CSF, MRI) are most useful in which cases? To maximize impact of this effort, we and our collaborators will test our tools on existing and new datasets from a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism (see Support Letters).

"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1        The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.

"Context-Sensitive Search of Human Expression Compendia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression experiments are an abundant and robust source of functional genomics data, with thousands of microarray and a growing number of high throughput RNA sequencing studies publicly available, most interrogating clinical and biological systems relevant to disease. They hold the promise of data-driven characterization of gene function and regulation, including in specific tissues, cell lines, and disease states, and can advance the understanding and modeling of regulatory changes that form the basis of human disease. However, these data remain largely underutilized, as biology researchers do not have effective tools to explore and analyze the entire data collection to generate novel hypotheses and direct experiments. The situation is similar to that of the Internet before the search engines - a biology researcher has to know a priori which datasets pertain to the biological question she is asking, reflect the tissue/cell-lineage specific signals of interest to her, and accurately measure the expression of genes related to her pathways of interest. There is a clear need for methods that will enable biology researchers to use their domain-specific knowledge to direct their exploration of public human expression data, enabling them to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing challenging biomedical questions. Such a system should provide users with ability to effectively explore automatically identified datasets relevant to their biological question of interest, leverage metazoan complexity including cell lineage and disease specific signals, and allow the researcher to securely include their unpublished data in the analysis. To address these challenges, this proposal describes a ""Google-style"" public search engine for large collections of gene expression data built using novel search algorithms and leveraging cloud-computing technologies. This system implements a novel query-based context-sensitive algorithm for search of large expression compendia that exploits the complexity of metazoan organisms, including cell-lineage complexity and disease aspects inherent to human expression studies. Furthermore, the challenge of heterogeneity in human samples will be addressed by developing novel hierarchical learning methods to predict cell-lineage or tissue-specific gene expression based on the compendium and to identify these signals in each dataset. This will enable users to explore tissue-specific expression and also will be integrated with the search algorithm to improve search accuracy. Proposed algorithms, search engine, and user interface will be extensively evaluated in close collaboration with biology researchers, and top predictions will be tested experimentally. These methods will be implemented in a user-friendly public search system that will leverage cloud computing to provide robust interactive query response and will enable biology researchers to explore both published data collections and their own pre-publication datasets in a context-specific, integrated, and secure manner.        We will develop a ""Google-style"" search engine for massive collections of human gene expression data. Our system will enable researchers to use their domain knowledge to explore the entirety of public human expression data to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing a diverse range of challenging biomedical questions. Public availability of our system will advance genome-level understanding of human biology and facilitate development of novel drugs, therapies, and personalized medical treatments.

"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. This proposal will also develop new computational methodologies for interpreting gene expression data that can be applied to other fields in medicine and biology. Thus, our work will have a broad impact on the ability to translate genomic data into clinically-relevant diagnostics and treatments across the full range of human health. n/a",Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics,8197396,R01HD058880,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'human data', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'prenatal', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NICHD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2012,306196,0.05261305061688537
"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach Project Summary/Abstract We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semi- systematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells. Project Narrative/Relevance to Public Health The interplay between the gene expression machinery and the compaction of genetic material into chromatin is now recognized as highly dynamic and complex. These processes must be tightly controlled for normal cellular physiology and to prevent disease states such as cancer. We will use a systems approach to genetically dissect the structural and functional relationships between the highly conserved components of these pathways in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, in order to more easily understand and eventually manipulate the vast complexity of human cells. n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,8258763,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histone H4', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'prevent', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2012,438425,0.024291929209388007
"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. These challenges call for novel statistical learning methods, especially for high dimensional and noisy data. The goal of this project is to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems. In particular, this project develops (1) novel techniques to assess statistical significance of clustering for high dimensional data; (2) several novel predictive models including classification and regression which are expected to yield highly competitive accuracy and interpretability; (3) new methods for high dimensional biomarker/variable selection; (4) new approaches to estimate high dimensional covariance/precision matrix for biological network construction.

"Computational Methods for Expression Image Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in high-throughput bio-imaging technologies are enabling scientists to capture the spatio- temporal patterns of gene expression in cells, organs and individuals in efforts to generate a more comprehensive picture of genome function. Today, images capturing gene expression and protein localization patterns have unprecedented spatial resolution, resulting in high-quality maps (expression images) in model organisms. However, computational biology of gene expression patterns lags far behind genome informatics. Automated and efficient tools for analyzing expression images are a prerequisite for generating biological insights into gene functions, interactions and networks for the next generation of scientists. This project focuses on the development of novel tools and techniques for large-scale biological annotation and comparative analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of a model organism (Drosophila melanogaster; the fruit fly). This choice is important because the fruit fly is a canonical model organism for understanding the development of humans and other animals. The availability of >100,000 images that capture gene expression patterns, provides an opportunity to examine the similarities and differences in the expression of the developing embryos of fruit fly genes, many of which show a very high sequence and biochemical function similarity to humans proteins. Three primary aims of the proposed research are as follows: (a) Develop machine learning methods that will use the existing, but coarse, knowledge in training, and will produce refined and new stage information for existing and future images. The knowledge of the precise developmental stage is important because it enables the biologically-meaningful mining of genes with similar spatial patterns, calculating the developmental trajectories of gene expressions, facilitating stage-sensitive textual annotation of expressions captured in images, and building genome-wide expression pattern maps at critical junctures in development. (b) Develop machine learning methods to describe expression patterns in words by using the existing controlled vocabulary. These descriptions will enable the use of efficient text-mining tools to identify genes expressed in similar organs and their precursors. These descriptions will also provide a better comparison of expression patterns across species, because many efforts in the scientific community relate organism specific controlled vocabularies with each other. (c) Develop transfer learning techniques for stage and text annotation that can be used for images generated from future techniques. This is important because traditionally, machine learning approaches assume that the training data and test data are drawn from the same distribution. However, new bio-imaging techniques are producing higher resolution data with substantially different color and intensity distributions, and robust methods that apply across techniques are desired.           Project Narrative This project focuses on the analysis of gene expression patterns in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1).

"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control. The successful completion of this project will significantly advance our ability to understand the gene regulation by miRNAs in a variety of normal physiological processes and disease states.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: MicroRNAs are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single microRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets.

"Gene Prediction by Markov Models and Complementary Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the ab initio self-training algorithms for eukaryotic gene finding developed in the previous grant period in several important directions. First we will upgrade this algorithm to a multilevel data mining approach to allow construction of a consistent ""genome- transcriptome-proteome"" data structure at the early stages of a genome project. Here, we will compensate for an information deficit in various segments of experimental data (such as EST data) by unsupervised machine learning on existing and abundant data segments (an anonymous genomic sequence) with subsequent computational modeling of missing biological information (protein-coding genes and proteins). An important new feature of the self-training algorithm will be the utilization of protein level information to monitor and increase biological relevance of the models derived by the unsupervised iterative algorithm. Second, we will enhance the self-training algorithm developed earlier on a smaller scale and tested on fungal and other ""compact"" eukaryotic genomes (such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) to work with most complex eukaryotic genomes. At this higher level of complexity we see species with host genes occupying just a small fraction of genome which can be inhomogeneous in GC composition, populated with transposable elements and pseudogenes (besides animal genomes, genomes of some fungal pathogens as well as human parasites and their vectors fall into this category). Third, for the human microbiome containing bacterial, archaeal, viral and fungal species, situated at yet another end of the genome in homogeneity spectrum, we will develop improved algorithms and tools for ab initio gene identification. This work will be done in close contact with sequencing and annotation groups from leading genome centers both in the US and abroad.           NARRATIVE Rational systems biology, cancer cure, vaccine development, drug design, is impossible without understanding genomic DNA in human cell.

"Engineering DNA Delivery Polymers using Combinatorial and Cheminformatics Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to employ chemoenzymatic monomer synthesis, parallel polymer synthesis and cheminformatic modeling for the design and evaluation of polymers for transgene delivery. Gene-based strategies, designed to manipulate cellular phenotype by introducing exogenous genes, are attractive in therapeutic and functional genomics applications. Currently available non-viral (e.g. polymeric) gene delivery vectors are limited by toxicities and suffer from low efficacies. We hypothesize that a synergistic combination of rational chemoenzymatic synthesis of monomers and combinatorial polymer synthesis will lead to the rapid identification polymers with high efficacies for delivering genes to cells (Specific Aim 1). The rapid generation of transfection data will facilitate the construction of predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) cheminformatic models that correlate gene delivery efficacy with polymer and polyplex physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, hydrophobicity, zeta potential, etc.) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-Partial Least Squares (K-PLS) regression (Specific Aim 2). A novel QSAR 'model- of models' approach will be developed in which, polymer physicochemical properties will first be estimated using predictive QSAR models based on monomer structure. QSAR models for transgene expression will then be generated using these estimated properties as a result of which, predictions of transgene expression efficacy will be based directly on monomer structures. In the long-term, such predictive QSAR models will aid in the rational design of high-efficacy polymeric transfection agents, which a powerful approach for non-viral gene delivery. Recognizing that polymer-mediated transgene expression suffers from low efficacies, we will employ a combination treatment approach using mediators of intracellular trafficking and transcription (chemotherapeutic enhancers), designed to enhance transgene expression in cells (Specific Aim 3). Finally, effective polymers along with chemotherapeutic enhancers will be employed for delivering genes that encode TRAIL, which selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo (Specific Aim 4). SCID mouse xenograft models will be employed to investigate recession of 22Rv1 prostate tumors, and biodistribution and toxicity of the polymer-plasmid complexes will be investigated. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in the identification of (1) new effective polymers for non-viral gene delivery, (2) insights into polymer physicochemical factors that influence transgene delivery, (3) predictive QSAR models that will facilitate high-throughput 'in silico' identification of effective polymers, and (4) in vivo efficacy and biodistribution evaluation of polymer-based delivery. It is anticipated that this research will significantly impact gene-based therapeutics, functional genomics, and various applications that depend on high levels of transgene expression in cells. The proposed research will develop novel non-viral (polymeric) materials for gene delivery and evaluate them in vitro and in vivo. These will find significant application in gene therapy for a number of diseases and will expand therapeutic options in these cases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposed research describes the engineering of novel polymers using combinatorial syntheses and cheminformatic modeling for enhanced transgene expression in cells.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. Project Narrative  We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically  important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian  inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks.  We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during  breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and  disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is  unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process.  But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific  network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the  functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the  grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and  characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more  comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to  better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of  key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition,  such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell  differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment  scheme.

"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials.

"Point Impact and Sparsity in Functional Data Analysis.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a project to develop new methods of functional data analysis directed towards important public health applications in genomics and life course epidemiology. In genome-wide expression and DNA methylation studies, it is of interest to locate genes showing activity that is associated with clinical outcomes, e.g., to use gene expression profiles from the tumors of breast cancer patients to predict estrogen receptor protein concentration, an important prognostic marker for breast tumors. In such studies, the gene expression profile across a chromosome can be regarded a functional predictor, and a gene associated with the clinical outcome is identified by its base pair position along the chromosome. The key aim of the project is to develop new methods of statisti- cal inference for finding such genetic loci, leading to the identification of chromosomal regions that are potentially useful for diagnosis and therapy. Although there is extensive statistical literature on gene expression data, it is almost exclusively concerned with multiple testing procedures for detecting the presence of differentially expressed genes, and statistical methods for locating such genes based on expression profiles (interpreted as functional predictors) are not well developed. Although functional data analysis has reached a mature stage of development over the last ten years, serious problems can arise when the currently available methods are applied in situations involving functional predictors (or trajectories) that have point impact effects (as with gene expression), or in situations in which there is only sparse temporal resolution in the observation of the trajectories. The broad objectives of the project are to exploit fractal behavior in the trajectories to improve statistical learning methodology in functional data analysis. The project will have important implications for understanding a wide variety of complex adaptive systems having fractal behavior. Studies of calorie-intake trajectories and DNA methylation profiles related to cardiovascular risk outcomes, and growth rate trajectories related to neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed as applications of the new methodology. The first specific problem to be addressed is to show that the rates of learning in systems involving trajectories with fractal characteristics are determined by the Hurst parameter (i.e., the exponent of self-similarity scaling) and to show that a type of bootstrap learning can adapt to the full range of fractal behavior. The second specific problem to be addressed is to develop an imputation method for generating missing values of trajectories that have fractal properties (e.g., growth rate curves), and to find a way to carry out functional regression modeling based on the imputed trajectories. 1      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology. In particular, rigorous statistical inference for locating genes based on gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, and for studying the effect of growth rate trajectories on adult neuropsychological outcomes, will be developed.            The relevance of the project to public health is that novel statistical methods will be developed for addressing important questions in genomics and life course epidemiology.

"Context-Sensitive Search of Human Expression Compendia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression experiments are an abundant and robust source of functional genomics data, with thousands of microarray and a growing number of high throughput RNA sequencing studies publicly available, most interrogating clinical and biological systems relevant to disease. They hold the promise of data-driven characterization of gene function and regulation, including in specific tissues, cell lines, and disease states, and can advance the understanding and modeling of regulatory changes that form the basis of human disease. However, these data remain largely underutilized, as biology researchers do not have effective tools to explore and analyze the entire data collection to generate novel hypotheses and direct experiments. The situation is similar to that of the Internet before the search engines - a biology researcher has to know a priori which datasets pertain to the biological question she is asking, reflect the tissue/cell-lineage specific signals of interest to her, and accurately measure the expression of genes related to her pathways of interest. There is a clear need for methods that will enable biology researchers to use their domain-specific knowledge to direct their exploration of public human expression data, enabling them to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing challenging biomedical questions. Such a system should provide users with ability to effectively explore automatically identified datasets relevant to their biological question of interest, leverage metazoan complexity including cell lineage and disease specific signals, and allow the researcher to securely include their unpublished data in the analysis. To address these challenges, this proposal describes a ""Google-style"" public search engine for large collections of gene expression data built using novel search algorithms and leveraging cloud-computing technologies. This system implements a novel query-based context-sensitive algorithm for search of large expression compendia that exploits the complexity of metazoan organisms, including cell-lineage complexity and disease aspects inherent to human expression studies. Furthermore, the challenge of heterogeneity in human samples will be addressed by developing novel hierarchical learning methods to predict cell-lineage or tissue-specific gene expression based on the compendium and to identify these signals in each dataset. This will enable users to explore tissue-specific expression and also will be integrated with the search algorithm to improve search accuracy. Proposed algorithms, search engine, and user interface will be extensively evaluated in close collaboration with biology researchers, and top predictions will be tested experimentally. These methods will be implemented in a user-friendly public search system that will leverage cloud computing to provide robust interactive query response and will enable biology researchers to explore both published data collections and their own pre-publication datasets in a context-specific, integrated, and secure manner.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop a ""Google-style"" search engine for massive collections of human gene expression data. Our system will enable researchers to use their domain knowledge to explore the entirety of public human expression data to generate hypotheses and direct experiments addressing a diverse range of challenging biomedical questions.

"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. This proposal will also develop new computational methodologies for interpreting gene expression data that can be applied to other fields in medicine and biology.

"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,8063104,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histone H4', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2011,460136,0.021452724973129573
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments. Our ""biological maps"" will enable the visualization of evolutionary forces driving changes in the parasite's phenotype and should allow us to identify network design weaknesses in the parasite--potential vulnerabilities that could result in new malarial control strategies.           n/a",Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models,8131721,SC1AI080579,"['Animal Model', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Beryllium', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digestion', 'Discipline', 'Drug resistance', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Family', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hemoglobin', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Location', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'comparative genomics', 'computerized data processing', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'driving force', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'research study', 'response', 'stem', 'theories', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC1,2011,238085,0.023678464765759837
"Flexible statistical machine learning techniques for cancer-related data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene expression provides a snapshot of the cellular changes that promote tumor malignancy. Quantitative gene expression analysis, especially as implemented by DNA microarrays, has identified many new important cancer related genes and led to the development of new genomic-based clinical tests. For the quantitative aspect of gene expression analysis, many statistical methods have been used to study human tumors and to classify them into groups that can be used to predict clinical behavior. Despite progress, with the rapid advance of technology, massive and complex data are being generated in cancer research. Analyzing such data becomes more and more challenging. These challenges call for novel statistical learning methods, especially for high dimensional and noisy data. The goal of this project is to develop a host of new statistical learning techniques for solving complicated learning problems. In particular, this project develops (1) novel techniques to assess statistical significance of clustering for high dimensional data; (2) several novel predictive models including classification and regression which are expected to yield highly competitive accuracy and interpretability; (3) new methods for high dimensional biomarker/variable selection; (4) new approaches to estimate high dimensional covariance/precision matrix for biological network construction. These new developments are expected to allow scientists to analyze complex cancer genomic data with accurate prediction accuracy and increased interpretability.

"COMBINED COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSES OF GENE REGULATION BY MICRORNAS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and a single miRNA can modulate the expression of hundreds of gene targets. Identification of miRNA targets is a critical first step for miRNA functional studies. Unfortunately, none of the existing computational tools are sufficient for the accurate prediction of miRNA targets. The major goal of this study is to significantly improve our ability to predict miRNA gene targets by developing and validating a new computational target prediction model. Our preliminary data indicate that machine learning techniques are effective in building improved target prediction models using expression profiling data. Based on these studies, we propose the hypothesis that the application of novel computational methods on large expression profiling datasets will lead to a robust bioinformatics model for miRNA target prediction. Under Specific Aim 1, we will build this model by first performing microarray profiling analyses to identify a large number of miRNA-down regulated genes. The expression profiling data generated from our study will then be used as training data to identify general sequence features that are important to miRNA target prediction. These features will be systematically analyzed in various computational frameworks to build a robust target prediction model, which will later be validated with independent experimental data. Under Specific Aim 2, this new model will be used to develop an online miRNA database for target prediction for all known miRNAs in humans and animals. In addition to bioinformatics target prediction data, the new database will also host data integrated from many heterogeneous sources. Thus, our new database will serve as an integrated web portal to retrieve relevant miRNA functional data with a focus on miRNA target gene regulation. Finally, under Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the usefulness of the new computational model and database by initiating the development of new miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for disease control. As a specific example, we will test predicted oncogene modulation by natural and artificial miRNAs as a potential new strategy for cancer control.

"Gene Prediction by Markov Models and Complementary Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the ab initio self-training algorithms for eukaryotic gene finding developed in the previous grant period in several important directions. First we will upgrade this algorithm to a multilevel data mining approach to allow construction of a consistent ""genome- transcriptome-proteome"" data structure at the early stages of a genome project. Here, we will compensate for an information deficit in various segments of experimental data (such as EST data) by unsupervised machine learning on existing and abundant data segments (an anonymous genomic sequence) with subsequent computational modeling of missing biological information (protein-coding genes and proteins). An important new feature of the self-training algorithm will be the utilization of protein level information to monitor and increase biological relevance of the models derived by the unsupervised iterative algorithm. Second, we will enhance the self-training algorithm developed earlier on a smaller scale and tested on fungal and other ""compact"" eukaryotic genomes (such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) to work with most complex eukaryotic genomes. At this higher level of complexity we see species with host genes occupying just a small fraction of genome which can be inhomogeneous in GC composition, populated with transposable elements and pseudogenes (besides animal genomes, genomes of some fungal pathogens as well as human parasites and their vectors fall into this category). Third, for the human microbiome containing bacterial, archaeal, viral and fungal species, situated at yet another end of the genome in homogeneity spectrum, we will develop improved algorithms and tools for ab initio gene identification. This work will be done in close contact with sequencing and annotation groups from leading genome centers both in the US and abroad.           NARRATIVE Rational systems biology, cancer cure, vaccine development, drug design, is impossible without understanding genomic DNA in human cell.

"Depression susceptibility genes and networks: expression, eQTL and GWAS analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability in the world (WHO). The severe, recurrent form often onsets during childhood or adolescence and becomes chronic. Heritability (35-70%) is similar to that of other common disorders for which genetic methodologies have yielded major discoveries. However, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have not yet produced significant results, and success may require much larger samples than are available. Alternative discovery strategies are urgently needed. Here, we will integrate genome-wide gene expression data from fresh blood with GWAS data to detect expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs - SNP loci that influence gene expression) with the goal of discovering new MDD susceptibility loci using two novel analytic strategies, including a gene network analysis method that will be substantially developed in the context of this work. We will also seek to refine and confirm the results with genome-wide expression data from brain tissue. We will recruit a new, population-based sample of 500 new recurrent MDD cases and 500 depression-free controls, using a novel strategy in collaboration with a survey research company. Using RNA extracted from RNA-stabilized whole blood, genome-wide gene expression levels will be assayed with Illumina HT-12 array, and common SNP genotypes will be assayed (Illumina 660W) from DNA. (We will also assay brain tissue from two regions from 39 case and 27 control specimens for confirmatory studies.) Potential non-genetic sources of variability will be considered and statistically controlled. Two novel analytic strategies will be used to discover MDD susceptibility alleles, genes and gene regulatory networks. (1) A univariate discovery strategy will identify case-control gene expression differences; detect SNP eQTLs for the selected genes using genome-wide SNP data in controls; and test the association of these SNPs to MDD in two independent GWA datasets. The prior selection of a small number of eQTLs in a separate sample greatly improves power by reducing the burden of multiple testing in GWA analysis. (2) We will extend a novel multivariate method that uses machine learning algorithms to detect gene regulatory networks, and then apply this model to the analysis of the association of co-regulated gene modules to MDD. These algorithms (a) use a background pathway graph that integrates a wide range of high-throughput and curated bioinformatic data to predict biological relationships between genes, to bias the algorithm toward biologically plausible hypotheses; and then (b) use eQTL data to construct a set of gene regulatory modules (co-expressed genes) and infer a sparse regulatory program for each module. The method will then be applied to the GWA data, and (using a novel transfer learning method) to brain data. These studies will identify genes and gene networks underlying susceptibility to major depression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells. Using a new set of statistical methods, the study will attempt to identify genes and networks of genes that are altered in some people who suffer from depression.

"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age. The National Cancer Institute in its 2006 budget proposal cited risk prediction as an area of extraordinary opportunity. Risk prediction models for cancer could provide valuable tools for identifying individuals who may benefit from preventive treatments or increased surveillance or who are good candidates to participate in clinical trials.

"Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand and model the dynamic topological and functional properties of cellular networks, such as the spatial-temporally specific and context-dependent rewiring of transcriptional regulatory circuitry and signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior. Current efforts to study biological networks have primarily focused on creating a descriptive analysis of macroscopic properties. Such simple analyses offer limited insights into the remarkably complex functional and structural organization of a biological system, especially in a dynamic context. Furthermore, most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks based on high-throughput data ignore the dynamic aspect of the network topology and represent it as an invariant graph. To our knowledge the network itself is rarely considered as an object that is changing and evolving. In this proposal, we aim to develop principled machine learning algorithms that reverse engineer the temporally and spatially varying interactions between biological molecules from longitudinal or spatial experimental data. Our approaches will take into account biological prior information such as transcriptional factor binding targets, gene knockout experiments, gene ontology, and PPI. Contrary to traditional co-expression studies, our methods unfold the rewiring networks underlying the entire span of the biological process. This will make it possible to discover and trace transient molecular interactions, modules, and pathways during the progression of the process. We will also develop a Bayesian formalism to model and infer the ""dynamic network tomography"" - the meta-states that determine each molecule's function and relationship to other molecules, thereby driving the evolution of the network topology, possibly in response to internal perturbations or environmental changes. Using these new tools, we will carry out a case study on time series gene expression data from organotypic models of breast cancer progression/reversal to gain insight into the mechanisms that drive the temporal rewiring of gene networks during this process. Finally we will also deliver a software platform offering the tools developed in this project to the public. So far, there has not been work done to consider temporally and spatially varying biological interactions under a unified framework. Our proposed work represents an initial foray into this important problem. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology. We envisage a new paradigm that facilitates: 1) Statistical inference and learning of gene networks that are evolving over space and time, possibly in response to various stimuli and possibly mediating genome-environmental interactions. 2) Thorough exploration of the underlying functional underpinnings that drive the network rewiring, dynamic trajectory, and trend of functional evolution. 3) Uncovering transient events taking place in the dynamic systems, building predictive understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation, network formation, and evolution. 4) Fast and accurate computational algorithms, with stronger statistical guarantee and greater scalability and robustness in large-scale dynamic network analysis. 5) A full spectrum of convenient software packages and user interfaces for dynamic network analysis, available to the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of time- and space-varying (rather than static) gene network learning, and Bayesian inference of the latent dynamic multi-functionality of genes/proteins in the context of such evolving networks. We intend to apply our method to the study of the dynamic genome-microenvironmental interactions during breast cancer progression and reversal. Since any complex biological processes such as development and disease pathogenesis involve intricate and transient regulatory events and signal transduction, it is unreasonable to assume that the underlying network of gene interaction is invariant throughout the process. But modern experimental and computational methodology is not able to identify such time/space specific network due to technical difficulty, therefore our proposed new methods for inferring evolving network, and the functional underpinnings behind network rewiring are not only needed, but also necessary; but it is beyond the grasp of convention methods and requires the methodological innovations we propose. Unraveling and characterizing such dynamic activities and trajectories of biological networks can provide a more comprehensive genetic and molecular view of complex biological processes and diseases, which may lead to better understanding of the mechanisms driving genome-microenvironmental interactions, and identification of key elements in the network responsible for the functional integrity of the network and the system; in addition, such an approach will allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of these genes with respect to cell differentiation and disease pathogenesis, and to develop improved diagnostic biomarkers and treatment scheme.",Time/Space-Varying Networks of Molecular Interactions: A New Paradigm for Studyin,7865088,R01GM093156,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Case Study', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Documentation', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Heel', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune response', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Problem Formulations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA Interference', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Simulate', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell behavior', 'combinatorial', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'design', 'driving force', 'environmental change', 'fitness', 'gene function', 'gene interaction', 'grasp', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'knockout gene', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'software systems', 'sound', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'trait', 'trend', 'tumor progression', 'user friendly software', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,460864,0.007263755986147367
"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,7810583,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2010,467448,0.021452724973129573
"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. This proposal will also develop new computational methodologies for interpreting gene expression data that can be applied to other fields in medicine and biology. Thus, our work will have a broad impact on the ability to translate genomic data into clinically-relevant diagnostics and treatments across the full range of human health.          n/a",Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics,7713981,R01HD058880,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bite', 'Blood', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'human data', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'prenatal', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NICHD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2010,319254,0.05352137848287446
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments. Our ""biological maps"" will enable the visualization of evolutionary forces driving changes in the parasite's phenotype and should allow us to identify network design weaknesses in the parasite--potential vulnerabilities that could result in new malarial control strategies.           n/a",Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models,7910601,SC1AI080579,"['Animal Model', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Be++ element', 'Beryllium', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digestion', 'Discipline', 'Drug resistance', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Family', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hemoglobin', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Location', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'comparative genomics', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'driving force', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'research study', 'response', 'stem', 'theories', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC1,2010,240491,0.023678464765759837
"Transcriptional co-regulators in epidermis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The stratified mammalian epidermis develops from somatic ectoderm by the progressive addition and differentiation of superficial epidermal layers (1). After the initial morphogenesis, the epidermis is maintained by homeostatic mechanisms whereby keratinocytes move from the proliferating basal cell layer towards the surface as they undergo a series of differentiation steps, ultimately undergoing cell death. One role of keratinocyte differentiation is the formation of an effective permeability barrier, which depends on the regulated expression of a large battery of genes encoding components of the cornified and granular layers (2). Under funding by the parent grant, we are using molecular biology to investigate the role of a single transcription factor, the Grainyhead-like transcription factor Get1/Grhl3 (3-5), in epidermal differentiation. In contrast, in this revision application, we propose a systems biology approach to computationally generate transcriptional regulatory network for the process of epidermal differentiation. Thus, this application leads to a new direction and differs from the parent grant in two important ways: First, it expands the scope of the study to transcriptional regulatory networks in epidermal development in general, and second, it incorporates the methods of systems biology; thus the application is consistent with one of the key emphasis areas of this RFA (Developmental Biology - Systems biology). The specific goals are to: 1) Generate global gene expression data over the time course of epidermal keratinocyte differentiation; and 2) Use the time course gene expression data from 1, other genome-wide expression data, DNA motif information, functional annotation, and literature mining to infer transcriptional networks in epidermal differentiation. The goal of this project is also to build a new interdisciplinary team between the Andersen laboratory, whose primary expertise is in molecular/developmental biology, and Alex Ihler, a new assistant professor whose primary expertise is in graphical models, Bayesian inference methods, machine learning, and data mining. The contributions of the Ihler group -- the mathematical modeling required to define the networks -- will allow approaches and advances in our understanding of epidermal differentiation that would not be attainable without this collaboration.               Defective epidermal differentiation and disrupted barrier formation are salient features of several skin diseases, including childhood eczema and psoriasis. With the definition of networks important for these processes, we expect to discover new diagnostic approaches and treatment targets.",Transcriptional co-regulators in epidermis,7776854,R01AR044882,"['Area', 'Basal Cell', 'Cell Death', 'Childhood', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Ectoderm', 'Eczema', 'Epidermis', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Morphogenesis', 'Permeability', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Psoriasis', 'Role', 'Series', 'Stratum Granulosum', 'Surface', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'data mining', 'genome-wide', 'keratinocyte', 'keratinocyte differentiation', 'mathematical model', 'novel diagnostics', 'parent grant', 'professor', 'skin disorder', 'text searching', 'time use', 'transcription factor']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2009,146526,-0.015391413481258937
"Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Even state-of-the-art homology methods cannot annotate metabolic genes with no or remote sequence identity to known enzymes. This presents a significant obstacle to network reconstruction, as about 30%- 40% (>1500) of known metabolic activities remain orphan, i.e. there are no known proteins catalyzing these activities in any organism. The scale of the orphan activities problem makes it arguably the single biggest challenge of modern biochemistry. We propose to develop, experimentally validate, and make available to the scientific community an efficient computational approach to fill the remaining gaps in metabolic networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to use genes assigned to the network neighbors of the remaining gaps as constraints in assigning genes for orphan activities. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms simpler or existing methods. Our cross-validated results in model organisms demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the correct genes in more than 50% of the cases, without any sequence homology information. The calculations indicate that the prediction accuracy will also remain high in less studied organisms. Using the developed method we have already identified and validated a gene responsible for an E. coli metabolic activity which remained orphan for more than 25 years. There are four specific aims of the proposal: 1.) We will calculate the appropriate context-based descriptors of protein function for the majority of sequenced organisms. Many new functional descriptors will be developed and used for the predictions. 2.) We will investigate the ability of various machine learning approaches and fitness functions to integrate context-based descriptors. Based on the developed methodology we will make predictions for all orphan activities in sequenced organisms. 3.) The predictions will be available through a searchable and constantly updated Web server. We will also develop a method to detect functional misannotations and apply it to all public metabolic databases. 4.) In collaboration with the laboratories of Dr. Uwe Sauer (ETH Zurich) and Dr. George Church (Harvard) we will experimentally test at least 50 of the predicted genes without close sequence homologs in E. coli, B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae.           n/a",Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities,7653790,R01GM079759,"['Animal Model', 'Arts', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Church', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Orphan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Sequence Homology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Validation', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'metabolomics', 'protein function', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,397297,0.006325126773708689
"Gene Prediction by Markov Models and Complementary Methods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the ab initio self-training algorithms for eukaryotic gene finding developed in the previous grant period in several important directions. First we will upgrade this algorithm to a multilevel data mining approach to allow construction of a consistent ""genome- transcriptome-proteome"" data structure at the early stages of a genome project. Here, we will compensate for an information deficit in various segments of experimental data (such as EST data) by unsupervised machine learning on existing and abundant data segments (an anonymous genomic sequence) with subsequent computational modeling of missing biological information (protein-coding genes and proteins). An important new feature of the self-training algorithm will be the utilization of protein level information to monitor and increase biological relevance of the models derived by the unsupervised iterative algorithm. Second, we will enhance the self-training algorithm developed earlier on a smaller scale and tested on fungal and other ""compact"" eukaryotic genomes (such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) to work with most complex eukaryotic genomes. At this higher level of complexity we see species with host genes occupying just a small fraction of genome which can be inhomogeneous in GC composition, populated with transposable elements and pseudogenes (besides animal genomes, genomes of some fungal pathogens as well as human parasites and their vectors fall into this category). Third, for the human microbiome containing bacterial, archaeal, viral and fungal species, situated at yet another end of the genome in homogeneity spectrum, we will develop improved algorithms and tools for ab initio gene identification. This work will be done in close contact with sequencing and annotation groups from leading genome centers both in the US and abroad.           NARRATIVE Rational systems biology, cancer cure, vaccine development, drug design, is impossible without understanding genomic DNA in human cell.

"Depression susceptibility genes and networks: expression, eQTL and GWAS analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability in the world (WHO). The severe, recurrent form often onsets during childhood or adolescence and becomes chronic. Heritability (35-70%) is similar to that of other common disorders for which genetic methodologies have yielded major discoveries. However, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have not yet produced significant results, and success may require much larger samples than are available. Alternative discovery strategies are urgently needed. Here, we will integrate genome-wide gene expression data from fresh blood with GWAS data to detect expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs - SNP loci that influence gene expression) with the goal of discovering new MDD susceptibility loci using two novel analytic strategies, including a gene network analysis method that will be substantially developed in the context of this work. We will also seek to refine and confirm the results with genome-wide expression data from brain tissue. We will recruit a new, population-based sample of 500 new recurrent MDD cases and 500 depression-free controls, using a novel strategy in collaboration with a survey research company. Using RNA extracted from RNA-stabilized whole blood, genome-wide gene expression levels will be assayed with Illumina HT-12 array, and common SNP genotypes will be assayed (Illumina 660W) from DNA. (We will also assay brain tissue from two regions from 39 case and 27 control specimens for confirmatory studies.) Potential non-genetic sources of variability will be considered and statistically controlled. Two novel analytic strategies will be used to discover MDD susceptibility alleles, genes and gene regulatory networks. (1) A univariate discovery strategy will identify case-control gene expression differences; detect SNP eQTLs for the selected genes using genome-wide SNP data in controls; and test the association of these SNPs to MDD in two independent GWA datasets. The prior selection of a small number of eQTLs in a separate sample greatly improves power by reducing the burden of multiple testing in GWA analysis. (2) We will extend a novel multivariate method that uses machine learning algorithms to detect gene regulatory networks, and then apply this model to the analysis of the association of co-regulated gene modules to MDD. These algorithms (a) use a background pathway graph that integrates a wide range of high-throughput and curated bioinformatic data to predict biological relationships between genes, to bias the algorithm toward biologically plausible hypotheses; and then (b) use eQTL data to construct a set of gene regulatory modules (co-expressed genes) and infer a sparse regulatory program for each module. The method will then be applied to the GWA data, and (using a novel transfer learning method) to brain data. These studies will identify genes and gene networks underlying susceptibility to major depression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells. Using a new set of statistical methods, the study will attempt to identify genes and networks of genes that are altered in some people who suffer from depression. This information would be useful in finding new treatment or prevention strategies.              The proposed project will recruit individuals with and without histories of recurrent depression and then study both the DNA sequence and the activity levels of genes in blood cells.

"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age.

"The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        This competing renewal application requests five years of support for the Conte Center for the Neuroscience of Mental Disorders (CCNMD): The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior. The Surgeon General notes, that 30,000 suicides per year in the United States and ten times that number of suicide attempts, requires a response that involves improving our knowledge regarding the relative importance of multiple predictors of suicide risk. The CCNMD employs a multidisciplinary approach to develop a predictive and explanatory model for suicidal behavior. Project 1: In the brainstem of depressed suicides we have found more serotonin neurons, more TPH, less serotonin transporter expression and 5-HT1A binding, all effects that enhance activity. The brainstem changes may be a response to less serotonin input and lower neurodensity in ventral prefrontal cortex of suicide and that may underlie increased impulsivity and suicide risk. We plan to map the circuitry of suicide by adding studies of anterior cingulate and amygdala, and to study neuron survival in prefrontal cortex. Project 2: Microarray analysis of the transcriptome in the same brain regions as Project 1 will map altered gene expression and be compared to murine models in Projects 6 and 7. Project 3: CCNMD investigators have successfully tested a predictive stress-diathesis model where suicidal ideation is a proximal predictor and lifetime aggressivity/impulsivity is a trait predictor of suicide attempts in major depression. We now propose to evaluate potential causal factors (genes and adverse childhood experiences) and an intermediate biological phenotype, the HPA axis in a prospective study. Project 4: We will use PET to determine whether the postmortem receptor changes differentially associated with major depression and suicide can be distinguished in vivo. Effects of susceptibility gene expression on binding to 5-HTT, 5-HTiA and MAOA will be determined by PET and related to depression and suicidal behavior. Project 5 builds on our familial transmission results. This bottom-up familial transmission study will examine suicidality, aggression/impulsivity, serotonin susceptibility genes, and psychopathology in very high-risk families with depressed adolescent attempter probands. Projects 6 and 7 involve murine models of depression and aggression related to single genes and an inbred strain. Effects of altered gene expression at critical phases and of maternal deprivation on behavior, brain morphology, gene expression profiles, neurogenesis and biochemistry will be evaluated and compared with clinical findings. Project 8 proposed use of statistical model selection for suicide prediction and analysis of large postmortem and in vivo imaging data sets using statistical learning theory that allows the flexible fitting of models with many predictors.       n/a",The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior,7640534,P50MH062185,"['Adolescent', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Inbred Strain', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Maternal Deprivation', 'Mental disorders', 'Methaqualone', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Personnel', 'Serotonin', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Surgeon', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'brain morphology', 'depressed', 'depression', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neurogenesis', 'proband', 'receptor', 'response', 'serotonin transporter', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,P50,2009,2127235,-0.032922293810621304
"Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fetal developmental disorders and pregnancy complications pose critical public health challenges. Yet our ability to monitor prenatal development and neonatal health has not fully entered the era of genomic medicine. Recent technological advances have allowed us to monitor global gene expression in the living human fetus or newborn, raising the possibility of creating revolutionary early diagnostics for a range of developmental disorders. Yet in order to realize this vision, we need to overcome two bioinformatics challenges. First, state-of-the-art interpretation of gene expression data requires information about how genes work together as systems. However, existing systems/pathway annotation is focused predominantly on adult disorders and is inappropriate for the analysis of fetal gene expression. Second, traditional methods for designing diagnostics from gene expression data require many examples of each sample type to be recognized. For rare diseases that cannot currently be detected in utero, however, the collection of a large number of fetal expression profiles representing each disorder is impractical. Our proposal addresses these challenges via two specific aims. First, we will develop a method for discovering new, statistically-validated gene sets from expression data. We will use this method, along with literature mining, to develop new systems biology annotation specific to this developmental stage. Second, we will develop and validate a new computational paradigm for sample classification that can identify and determine the nature of rare abnormal developmental profiles. Our methods, though motivated by the study of human development, can be applied to any medical area where existing functional annotation is inadequate or the collection of typical classification data is infeasible. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project will enable the development of new diagnostics for monitoring maternal/fetal and neonatal health, which will in turn help reduce the huge public health costs of pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. This proposal will also develop new computational methodologies for interpreting gene expression data that can be applied to other fields in medicine and biology. Thus, our work will have a broad impact on the ability to translate genomic data into clinically-relevant diagnostics and treatments across the full range of human health.          n/a",Translational Bioinformatics for Human Developmental Genomics,7507028,R01HD058880,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bite', 'Blood', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Classification', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Information Sciences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prenatal Diagnosis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'human data', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'prenatal', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NICHD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R01,2009,322622,0.05352137848287446
"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,7629191,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'histone modification', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,448088,0.021452724973129573
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments. Our ""biological maps"" will enable the visualization of evolutionary forces driving changes in the parasite's phenotype and should allow us to identify network design weaknesses in the parasite--potential vulnerabilities that could result in new malarial control strategies.           n/a",Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models,7669377,SC1AI080579,"['Animal Model', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Be++ element', 'Beryllium', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digestion', 'Discipline', 'Drug resistance', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Family', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hemoglobin', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Location', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'driving force', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'research study', 'response', 'stem', 'theories', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC1,2009,240426,0.023678464765759837
"Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Even state-of-the-art homology methods cannot annotate metabolic genes with no or remote sequence identity to known enzymes. This presents a significant obstacle to network reconstruction, as about 30%- 40% (>1500) of known metabolic activities remain orphan, i.e. there are no known proteins catalyzing these activities in any organism. The scale of the orphan activities problem makes it arguably the single biggest challenge of modern biochemistry. We propose to develop, experimentally validate, and make available to the scientific community an efficient computational approach to fill the remaining gaps in metabolic networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to use genes assigned to the network neighbors of the remaining gaps as constraints in assigning genes for orphan activities. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms simpler or existing methods. Our cross-validated results in model organisms demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the correct genes in more than 50% of the cases, without any sequence homology information. The calculations indicate that the prediction accuracy will also remain high in less studied organisms. Using the developed method we have already identified and validated a gene responsible for an E. coli metabolic activity which remained orphan for more than 25 years. There are four specific aims of the proposal: 1.) We will calculate the appropriate context-based descriptors of protein function for the majority of sequenced organisms. Many new functional descriptors will be developed and used for the predictions. 2.) We will investigate the ability of various machine learning approaches and fitness functions to integrate context-based descriptors. Based on the developed methodology we will make predictions for all orphan activities in sequenced organisms. 3.) The predictions will be available through a searchable and constantly updated Web server. We will also develop a method to detect functional misannotations and apply it to all public metabolic databases. 4.) In collaboration with the laboratories of Dr. Uwe Sauer (ETH Zurich) and Dr. George Church (Harvard) we will experimentally test at least 50 of the predicted genes without close sequence homologs in E. coli, B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae.           n/a",Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities,7496031,R01GM079759,"['Animal Model', 'Arts', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Church', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Numbers', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Orphan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Range', 'Research Personnel', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Sequence Homology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Validation', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'metabolomics', 'protein function', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2008,383732,0.006325126773708689
"Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dynamics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microarray technology enables investigators to simultaneously measure the expression of thousands of genes and holds the promise to cast new light onto the regulatory mechanisms of the genome. A main avenue of experimental investigation, leveraging on this technology, is based on the temporal dissection of cellular mechanisms. Temporal experiments offer the possibility of observing these mechanisms in action and to break down the genome into sets of genes involved in the same processes. The overall goal of this project is to develop an unsupervised approach and an integrated software environment to automatically discover regulatory mechanisms from temporal microarray experiments. The hypothesis underpinning our approach is that complex interaction patterns can be identified through analysis of conditional rather than marginal gene expression profiles. This novel approach also provides principled guidance to experimental design and sampling strategies, and it naturally extends to a large class of statistical models, able to capture a wider range of dynamic behaviors and experimental designs. We plan to develop a comprehensive framework to design and analyze microarray data collected through temporal experiments. This framework will be used to specify and answer the critical design questions of sample size and sampling frequency determination. Using this framework, we will develop a new model-based approach and an iterative search algorithm, called Conditional Clustering, to identify different patterns of behavior determined by a set of genes through the analysis of the behavior of a gene given a set of other genes, rather than the behavior of each gene in isolation. We will implement this design and analysis framework in a computer program that will be distributed over the Internet.This project brings together researchers in artificial intelligence, theoretical statistics and experimental design with a long track record of methodological contributions to bioinformatics to develop a novel methodological approach to a critical question at the forefront of genomic research.         n/a",Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dynamics,7350919,R01HG003354,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Class', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Light', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Names', 'Numbers', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Today', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'computer program', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide analysis', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'size', 'software development', 'statistics']",NHGRI,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2008,298801,0.017207688750858745
"Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposed study will build upon the extensive epidemiologic database and specimen repository derived from an ongoing bladder cancer study entitled ""Genetic Susceptibility to Bladder Cancer: A Molecular Epidemiologic Approach"" (RO1 CA74880, PI: Xifeng Wu). The parent grant involved a multidisciplinary group of researchers applying a molecular epidemiologic approach to identify inter-individual differences in susceptibility to bladder carcinogenesis, with a focus on genes involved in protecting against genomic instability, such as DNA repair, cell cycle, and telomere maintenance. It is increasing recognized that inflammation plays an important role in the etiology of many cancers, including bladder cancer (BC). We have recently shown that an IL-6 promoter SNP (G-174C) is associated with BC risk and progression. In this application, we will test the hypothesis that BC is modulated by common, low penetrance polymorphisms in inflammation related genes, interacting with each other and/or environmental factors. We will take a pathway based genotyping approach and apply novel statistical tools to address the hypothesis. There are 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify candidate polymorphisms in inflammation related genes that predispose individuals to BC. We plan to perform genotyping of a comprehensive list of potential functional polymorphisms in inflammation genes (85 polymorphisms in 44 genes) on 1000 Caucasian cases and 1000 controls matched on age, gender, and ethnicity. Specific Aim 2: To perform genotyping on tagging SNPs for the top 8 candidate genes that were identified in Specific Aim 1 (using a significance level of 0.1) identified in Specific Aim 1. This will give us a complete picture of the role that the specific gene plays in BC etiology. We will implement haplotype-based analyses to identify any additional variants that might have been missed using individual SNP-based approaches. Specific Aim 3: To apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene- gene interactions influencing risk for BC. These analyses will examine SNP main effects and gene-gene interactions, gene-environment interaction and develop and validate algorithms, which will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. The application will allow us to have a comprehensive picture of the effects of functional polymorphisms in inflammation related genes on BC risk.          n/a",Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk,7458073,R03CA130063,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Erythrocytes', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-6', 'Length', 'Literature', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Significance Level', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'college', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'promoter', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R03,2008,77000,0.011292712186033765
"Molecular Genetics of HNPCC    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to elucidate genetic risk modifiers influencing age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) using a pathway-based approach. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that SNPs in cell cycle pathways influence the efficiency of the finely tuned mechanisms of cell cycle progression. We will continue to build and expand upon our unique clinical and specimen resource of mismatch repair gene mutation carriers in order to accomplish this goal. In aim 1, we will determine the role that genetic variants in cell cycle genes have on risk for development of early onset HNPCC. We will use the Illumina Golden Gate platform to genotype SNPs from 153 cell cycle genes. We will evaluate the main effects of SNPs in these genes using a two-phase study design in order to determine if there are differences in age-associated risk for development of HNPCC between carriers of the wild type genotype vs. those carrying one or two copies of the SNP. In aim 2, we will use novel machine learning analytic tools to determine if we can identify combinations of cell cycle SNPs that work together to influence risk for development of early onset HNPCC. Two approaches will be used to accomplish this goal. A focused candidate gene approach, and the second is an exploratory, pathways based approach. In the focused candidate approach, we have selected 12 candidate genes because they are known to interact with each other in the cell cycle pathways and there is evidence that SNPs in these genes influence risk for HNPCC or other cancers. We will determine if combinations of these SNPs work together to influence development of HNPCC at an early age. In the second approach we will investigate SNPs in all 153 of the genes, including the 12 candidate genes. We hypothesize that there are many possible combinations of cell cycle genes that work together and under the influence of SNPS, contribute to development of HNPCC at an early age. We will use Random Forests (RF) modeling to rank all of the SNPs from these genes. RF can handle large numbers of predictor variables such as SNPs and provides estimates of variable importance. We will then use CART to build age-to-onset trees using the SNPs ranked the highest from RF. The proposed studies will contribute to our long-term goal to develop a risk model for early onset HNPCC by defining the role that SNPs in cell cycle genes play in risk for HNPCC. They will also provide important information regarding novel gene-gene interactions contributing to risk for development of HNPCC at an earlier age.

The lack of algorithms and user-friendly software to mine the existing data may be partly blamed. The proposed study will provide useful tools to mine the genetic data from different sources. This pilot project focuses on developing efficient algorithms for clustering, molecular network construction, and biomarker discovery with integrated SNP and gene expression data. With the efficient data mining methods we develop, cancer researchers may get much more useful information from the otherwise unexplored data. Therefore it has broad implications in the analysis of all high priority areas in cancer epidemiology research identified by Progress Review Groups, such as multiple myeloma and cancers of the breast, colon/rectum, prostate, lung, pancreas, and brain, and linking genetic polymorphisms with other variable related to cancer risk. Upon complete the proposed research, the methods/algorithms developed can potentially be applied to other mixed data sources such as methylation, gene expression, and others. We hope our researches have the impact of encouraging more people to contribute to this challenging problem.          n/a",Statistical and Computational Methods for Systematically Mining the SNP and Gene ,7414721,R03CA128102,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Cations', 'Colon, Rectum', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Etiology', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Paper', 'Pilot Projects', 'Principal Investigator', 'Progress Review Group', 'Prostate', 'Public Domains', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Solid', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer risk', 'data mining', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R03,2008,74250,0.005969019613522864
"Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have recently developed a genetic screening approach, termed E-MAP (Epistatic MiniArray Technology Profiling), that can quantify the strength of systematically generated pair-wise genetic interactions. The method identifies negative double mutant interactions, where combination of mutations causes defects leads to enhancement of growth defects or lethality. Such interactions often specify membership of parallel biochemical pathways. Additionally, E-MAP also identifies positive interactions, where combination of mutants show mutual suppression or lack any additive defects, which are enriched among physically interacting gene products. Using gene deletions of non-essential genes and hypomorphic alleles of essential genes, we have recently generated E-MAPs in S. cerevisiae that have focused on 1) the early secretory pathway and 2) chromosome biology, which includes transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We now propose the second generation of E-MAP analysis, allowing us to address the next level of complexity, via examination of point mutants of multifunctional and essential genes. Specifically, we will genetically dissect two essential, multisubunit, multifunctional complexes at the heart of gene expression and chromatin structure: RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and the nucleosome. This approach will allow us to A) map the structural features of these complexes onto their functional roles, and B) characterize the functional relationships between RNAPII and the nucleosome and the wider gene expression apparatus. In Aim #1, we will use the chromosome biology E-MAP to genetically examine a set of approximately 450 histone H3 and H4 mutants including A) complete alanine (or serine)-scans, B) comprehensive substitution of modifiable residues, and C) semisystematic deletions of the N-terminal tails. The work, which is being done collaboratively with NIH Roadmap TCNP (Technology Center for Networks and Pathways) of Lysine Modification (PI Jef Boeke), will help reveal how histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts and histone modifications influence the steps of transcription and chromatin regulation. In Aim #2, we will screen approximately 100 distinct and diverse point mutants of several essential RNAPII subunits isolated in collaboration with Craig Kaplan and Roger Kornberg. In Aim #3, we will subject these data to hierarchical clustering and our recently developed metrics (S- and COP-scoring systems) to help identify functional relationships using the E-MAP data. We will also employ newly developed algorithms that identify functionally related sets of genes (or modules) from large-scale interaction datasets and allows for multi-functional genes to be members of more than one module. We anticipate that a systematic genetic approach described here will provide a more holistic view of chromatin function and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells.          n/a",Genetic Analysis of the Nucleosome and RNA Polymerase II: A Systems Approach,7445536,R01GM084448,"['Address', 'Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Arginine', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Essential Genes', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Galactose', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Histone H3', 'Histones', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Mycophenolic Acid', 'N-terminal', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Scanning', 'Score', 'Serine', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Threonine', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tyrosine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'computerized tools', 'gene function', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic profiling', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'protein function']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2008,467804,0.021452724973129573
"Genetics Pathways of Glioma Invasion    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malignant tumors of glial lineage are therapeutic challenges by virtue of relative inherent resistance to conventional cytolytic therapies and the innate proclivity of these cancer cells to invade into surrounding normal brain. Advances in extending median survival of glioma patients await strategies by which to control invasive tumor. The central hypothesis of this project is that local invasion by malignant glioblastoma cells is driven by specific and unique gene expression changes. Interference with the expression of these genes or interruption of the function of the gene products is likely to specifically target invasive glioblastoma cells, consequently impacting a major cause of tumor progression and recurrence. Success already realized from our use of laser capture microdissection and cDNA microarray analyses has generated candidate genes that have been validated in clinical specimens, and have undergone detailed cell and molecular biology experiments to determine the mechanism(s) by which candidate glioblastoma invasion genes activate the migratory or invasive process. Advances will be garnered through pursuit of 3 aims: The first aim is to sustain the discovery of candidate genes expressed or silenced in highly invasive glioblastoma cells compared to noninvading cells in the same tumor, and to place these candidate gene products into a functional matrix of aberrant signaling outcomes underlying invasion. The second aim is to validate candidate genes discovered in Aim #1 in the context of human glioblastoma invasion. The third aim is to determine the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of action of these genes and their matrix of aberrant signaling to discover points of convergence that serve as targets of vulnerability for therapeutic intervention. The sustained success of this project will assemble an understanding of genes driving the invasive phenotype of glioblastoma cells, discovering and validating crucial biochemical or regulatory linkages with other associated cell behaviors of proliferation and cell survival pathways. These findings will empirically elucidate those points of convergence in the pathways of the invasive phenotype that, when targeted by therapy, will most impact the malignant glial cell.         n/a",Genetics Pathways of Glioma Invasion,7391683,R01NS042262,"['Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antisense Oligonucleotides', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Co-Immunoprecipitations', 'Collection', 'Companions', 'Computational Technique', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Sequence', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Harvest', 'Histology', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Interruption', 'Invaded', 'Invasive', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Glioma', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Neuroglia', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Validation', 'cDNA Arrays', 'cancer cell', 'cell behavior', 'cryostat', 'gene function', 'laser capture microdissection', 'migration', 'neoplastic cell', 'programs', 'research study', 'success', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NINDS,TRANSLATIONAL GENOMICS RESEARCH INST,R01,2008,405644,0.002333169142824168
"A Gene Expression Based Blood Test for Rheumatic Disease Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Clinical dilemma: Recent advances in biologic therapies for rheumatic diseases provide a means for more profound disease management. Proper diagnosis is a necessary aspect of choosing the proper biologic therapy. While disease diagnosis, based on clinical findings and laboratory tests, is effective in a significant number of patients, it can be problematic in patients with early disease, mild symptoms, or unclear presentation, leading to delayed or inappropriate treatment with poor patient outcomes and/or exposures to unnecessary drug toxicities. This problem is due in part to limitations of specificity and sensitivity of current rheumatology diagnostic laboratory tests. Many of these tests are designed to include or rule out one disease, which may be inadequate to obtain a diagnosis if the results are negative. Our preliminary data suggest that a single blood test can be developed which is capable of sensitive and specific disease diagnosis of many common rheumatic diseases using gene expression profiling of peripheral blood. We also have data suggesting that this multi-disease test is effective in patients with early disease prior to full clinical differentiation and may aid in guiding earlier treatment which can dramatically improve outcomes.   Approach: To assess the potential of gene expression-based diagnostic testing, clinical samples were collected from a cohort of patients with definitive forms of inflammatory disease, and broad-based gene expression profiling was performed. Multivariate algorithms identified 38 genes that distinguished controls and the four inflammatory diseases tested with high specificity and sensitivity. We have subsequently collected RNA from a second larger patient cohort with sufficient size to power a study to distinguish among a set of rheumatic diseases that can be difficult to distinguish, namely rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and ankylosing spondylitis. Biostatistical analyses of gene expression profiles will allow us to translate these findings into two high throughput clinical tests, the first based on gene expression results and the second based on serum protein biomarkers. Finally, we will assess the prognostic power of gene expression profiling by examining results from patients early in their disease cycle with undifferentiated arthritis to determine who is likely to develop erosive disease and who is likely to go into remission. These findings will allow physicians to use more proactive forms of therapy in early undifferentiated arthritis to delay onset of erosive disease and to use less expensive drugs with fewer side effects for patients that are likely to remit. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will identify novel blood markers (biomarkers) for some of the more common forms of rheumatic diseases.  These biomarkers will be used by physicians to accurately diagnose these diseases and to help distinguish patients who are more likely to develop severe forms of disease from those likely to go into remission.  Earlier diagnosis and treatment are linked to better outcome in patients.       n/a",A Gene Expression Based Blood Test for Rheumatic Disease Diagnosis,7394136,R43AR055855,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Ankylosing spondylitis', 'Arthritis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Blood', 'Blood Tests', 'Categories', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease regression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Immunology procedure', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Serum Proteins', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Undifferentiated', 'base', 'cohort', 'concept', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'prognostic', 'response', 'size', 'tool']",NIAMS,"CRESCENDO BIOSCIENCE, INC.",R43,2008,147000,0.044992953778853
"The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        This competing renewal application requests five years of support for the Conte Center for the Neuroscience of Mental Disorders (CCNMD): The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior. The Surgeon General notes, that 30,000 suicides per year in the United States and ten times that number of suicide attempts, requires a response that involves improving our knowledge regarding the relative importance of multiple predictors of suicide risk. The CCNMD employs a multidisciplinary approach to develop a predictive and explanatory model for suicidal behavior. Project 1: In the brainstem of depressed suicides we have found more serotonin neurons, more TPH, less serotonin transporter expression and 5-HT1A binding, all effects that enhance activity. The brainstem changes may be a response to less serotonin input and lower neurodensity in ventral prefrontal cortex of suicide and that may underlie increased impulsivity and suicide risk. We plan to map the circuitry of suicide by adding studies of anterior cingulate and amygdala, and to study neuron survival in prefrontal cortex. Project 2: Microarray analysis of the transcriptome in the same brain regions as Project 1 will map altered gene expression and be compared to murine models in Projects 6 and 7. Project 3: CCNMD investigators have successfully tested a predictive stress-diathesis model where suicidal ideation is a proximal predictor and lifetime aggressivity/impulsivity is a trait predictor of suicide attempts in major depression. We now propose to evaluate potential causal factors (genes and adverse childhood experiences) and an intermediate biological phenotype, the HPA axis in a prospective study. Project 4: We will use PET to determine whether the postmortem receptor changes differentially associated with major depression and suicide can be distinguished in vivo. Effects of susceptibility gene expression on binding to 5-HTT, 5-HTiA and MAOA will be determined by PET and related to depression and suicidal behavior. Project 5 builds on our familial transmission results. This bottom-up familial transmission study will examine suicidality, aggression/impulsivity, serotonin susceptibility genes, and psychopathology in very high-risk families with depressed adolescent attempter probands. Projects 6 and 7 involve murine models of depression and aggression related to single genes and an inbred strain. Effects of altered gene expression at critical phases and of maternal deprivation on behavior, brain morphology, gene expression profiles, neurogenesis and biochemistry will be evaluated and compared with clinical findings. Project 8 proposed use of statistical model selection for suicide prediction and analysis of large postmortem and in vivo imaging data sets using statistical learning theory that allows the flexible fitting of models with many predictors.       n/a",The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior,7457762,P50MH062185,"['Adolescent', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'HPSE gene', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Inbred Strain', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Maternal Deprivation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methaqualone', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Numbers', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Serotonin', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Surgeon', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'brain morphology', 'experience', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neurogenesis', 'proband', 'receptor', 'response', 'serotonin transporter', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,P50,2008,2105498,-0.032922293810621304
"Comparative Genomics to Identify Functional Blocks & HGT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the genomes of more and more species are sequenced it has become apparent that 1 of the most powerful techniques for detemining region function in the human genome is by comparison to the genomes of other species. The implications of such understanding for disease diagnosis and specialized drug and vaccine design are dear. Similarly, genomic comparison between bacteria can reveal regions which are functionally important in the development of infectious diseases and again aid drug and vaccine design. This project has 2 primary research goals. One (1) is the development of methodology for finding functionally predictive signatures of non-coding sequences (NCS) highly conserved across multiple species, and the other is to develop novel approaches for defecting Horizontal Gene Transfer (HG'T). The comparison of genomes is the common thread in this research. ln pursuit of their first goal, the investigators plan to integrate genomic sequence data, provided by their collaborators, with experimental and literature data, such as microarray-expression data, GO-functional-annotation for nearby genes, and ChlP-Chip data. The results will be used to evaluate the functional relevance, if any, of each NCS and then to define a signature predictive of function in terms of measurable covariates and sequence structure. For instance, if a sequence signature characterizes NCS whose nearest genes contribute to a particular function then an unknown gene close to an NCS with the same signature would be a prime candidate for interrogation of that function. The Investigators propose to attack this problem  by 1). Developing non standard types of clustering methods based on supervised learning algorithms, e.g., Random Forests, 2) Representing the NCS by the parameters of a stochastic model and determining appropriate thresholds for model fitting by using resampling and other Monte Carlo methods. Under the second topic, the investigators propose 2 different approaches for determining whether functionaIly significant FGT has occurred in bacteria. The first approach is to take a known functionally important famlly (NIFgenes) for which HGT is a matter of dispute, and devise quantitative measures which they expect will enable a firm conclusion. They intend to refine similarity measures between genes in different species ,such as BLAST scores, corrected for evolutionary distance. They will compute these measures for pairs of NIF genes in different species, pairs, pairs of genes known to be HGT (antibiotic immunity conferring genes) and genes very unlikely to be HGT (ribosomal proteins). The second approach is to look for anomalously long stretches of 16s RNA conserved within substantial subsets of bacterial species which are otherwise only distantly related.  Mathematical and statistical challenge include: Under approach I, standardizing comparisons of genes with different mutation rates; devising an appropriate classifier for HGT vs. non HGT, and computing appropriate estimates of the probability of classifying a gene as HGT when it isn't and vice versa; Under approach II, extending existing methods for detecting large inclusions by taking into account phylogenetic tree topology and branch lengths.            n/a",Comparative Genomics to Identify Functional Blocks & HGT,7418308,R01GM075312,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blast Cell', 'Boxing', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Disputes', 'Distant', 'Drops', 'Exhibits', 'Functional RNA', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Markov Chains', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nif Genes', 'None or Not Applicable', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Planning Techniques', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal Proteins', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Score', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Tetraodontidae', 'Thinking', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'density', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'heuristics', 'markov model', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'prototype', 'size', 'statistics', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'willingness']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2008,162196,0.023345262912428447
"System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to the NIH call for Exploratory Collaborations with National Centers for Biomedical Computing, PAR-06-223, and it will involve a collaboration between Columbia University's MAGNet NCBC and a team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The aim of the proposal is a system-wide tudy of integrated transcriptional and metabolic networks in Eschericia coli K-12 strain, aiming at a similar analysis of a pathogen, Bacillus anthracis, at a later date. LANL hosts an experimental research program on bacterial metabolomics. Metabolites serve several functions. The most common one is being the precursors to various cellular components. They are also regulators of cellular functions by means of modulating metabolic reactions or binding to transcription factors and subsequently regulating gene expression. Conversely, the genes regulated by a transcription factor often encode enzymes, modulating the speed of metabolic reactions. Thus, to understand and ultimately predict the cellular response to an environmental change of interest (e.g., pathogen entry into its host environment), we must integrate the analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome. To address this need, we will work with the laboratories of Pat Unkefer and John Dunbar, which will produce data sets of about 300 joint metabolic/transcriptional profiles of E.coli under different steady-state growth conditions. The resources of MAGnet NCBC, specifically the algorithms within the geWorkbench bioinformatics platform produced by the center, will be leveraged to reconstruct cellular networks. Specifically, we expect that ARACNE, an algorithm originally developed by MAGNet for high-fidelity analysis of transcriptional networks in mammalian cells, is well positioned for reconstruction of metabolic networks from high throughput system-wide metabolic activity data, provide that appropriate modifications to deal with the specifics of the metabolic data are made. We will also adapt the algorithm to discover modulated interactions, that is, metabolic interactions that are conditional on the activity of a modulator gene (enzyme), or transcriptional interactions that require the presence of a metabolite to proceed. Such integrated genome/metabolome analysis has not been attempted yet. It will be a giant leap towards a complete understanding of cellular processes in an important organism. Because of the comparatively small size of bacterial genomes and metabolomes, it will be possible to perform system-wide analyses of interactions for the entire integrated genome and metabolome. While important in its own right, especially in view of the pathogenic nature of B. anthracis, this research would also represent an important test bed for a subsequent study of metabolic diseases in higher animals, including humans.           n/a",System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism,7387471,R21GM080216,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacillus anthracis', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Concentration measurement', 'Condition', 'Crystallography', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Documentation', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Gene', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mails', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Control', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multimedia', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virulence', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical informatics', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forging', 'hazard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LOS ALAMOS NAT SECTY-LOS ALAMOS NAT LAB,R21,2008,220227,-0.005133539541952557
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments.

Some of the proposed methods will incorporate or be applied to other types of genomic or proteomic data. In Aim A.1, we consider detecting differential gene expression. A weighted permutation scheme is proposed to improve permutation-based inference procedures, and these methods will be compared with several recently proposed parametric and semi-parametric methods. We also propose incorporating existing biological data in the statistical methods. In Aim A.2, we study a clustering-based classification (CBC) method for gene function prediction using microarray data. CBC will be compared with other state-of-the-art supervised machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines and random forests. Other sources of biological data, such as protein-protein interaction data, will be incorporated in the proposed method. In Aim A.3, we consider sample classification and prediction based on gene expression profiles in a general framework called penalized partial least squares (PPLS). PPLS will be compared with other supervised machine learning algorithms. We will extend PPLS to combine microarray data from multiple studies. We plan to implement the proposed statistical methods in R and make the software publicly and freely available.         n/a",Statistical Methods for Genomic and Proteomic Data,7226297,R01HL065462,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease regression', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heart failure', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Motivation', 'Pan Genus', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'forest', 'gene function', 'improved', 'novel', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2007,141753,0.023472678375198484
"Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Even state-of-the-art homology methods cannot annotate metabolic genes with no or remote sequence identity to known enzymes. This presents a significant obstacle to network reconstruction, as about 30%- 40% (>1500) of known metabolic activities remain orphan, i.e. there are no known proteins catalyzing these activities in any organism. The scale of the orphan activities problem makes it arguably the single biggest challenge of modern biochemistry. We propose to develop, experimentally validate, and make available to the scientific community an efficient computational approach to fill the remaining gaps in metabolic networks. The main idea of the proposed method is to use genes assigned to the network neighbors of the remaining gaps as constraints in assigning genes for orphan activities. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms simpler or existing methods. Our cross-validated results in model organisms demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the correct genes in more than 50% of the cases, without any sequence homology information. The calculations indicate that the prediction accuracy will also remain high in less studied organisms. Using the developed method we have already identified and validated a gene responsible for an E. coli metabolic activity which remained orphan for more than 25 years. There are four specific aims of the proposal: 1.) We will calculate the appropriate context-based descriptors of protein function for the majority of sequenced organisms. Many new functional descriptors will be developed and used for the predictions. 2.) We will investigate the ability of various machine learning approaches and fitness functions to integrate context-based descriptors. Based on the developed methodology we will make predictions for all orphan activities in sequenced organisms. 3.) The predictions will be available through a searchable and constantly updated Web server. We will also develop a method to detect functional misannotations and apply it to all public metabolic databases. 4.) In collaboration with the laboratories of Dr. Uwe Sauer (ETH Zurich) and Dr. George Church (Harvard) we will experimentally test at least 50 of the predicted genes without close sequence homologs in E. coli, B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae.           n/a",Computational Annotation of Orphan Metabolic Activities,7322388,R01GM079759,"['Animal Model', 'Arts', 'Base Sequence', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Church', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Numbers', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Orphan', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Range', 'Research Personnel', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sequence Homologs', 'Sequence Homology', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Validation', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene function', 'genome sequencing', 'metabolomics', 'protein function', 'reconstruction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,364130,0.006325126773708689
"Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dynamics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microarray technology enables investigators to simultaneously measure the expression of thousands of genes and holds the promise to cast new light onto the regulatory mechanisms of the genome. A main avenue of experimental investigation, leveraging on this technology, is based on the temporal dissection of cellular mechanisms. Temporal experiments offer the possibility of observing these mechanisms in action and to break down the genome into sets of genes involved in the same processes. The overall goal of this project is to develop an unsupervised approach and an integrated software environment to automatically discover regulatory mechanisms from temporal microarray experiments. The hypothesis underpinning our approach is that complex interaction patterns can be identified through analysis of conditional rather than marginal gene expression profiles. This novel approach also provides principled guidance to experimental design and sampling strategies, and it naturally extends to a large class of statistical models, able to capture a wider range of dynamic behaviors and experimental designs. We plan to develop a comprehensive framework to design and analyze microarray data collected through temporal experiments. This framework will be used to specify and answer the critical design questions of sample size and sampling frequency determination. Using this framework, we will develop a new model-based approach and an iterative search algorithm, called Conditional Clustering, to identify different patterns of behavior determined by a set of genes through the analysis of the behavior of a gene given a set of other genes, rather than the behavior of each gene in isolation. We will implement this design and analysis framework in a computer program that will be distributed over the Internet.This project brings together researchers in artificial intelligence, theoretical statistics and experimental design with a long track record of methodological contributions to bioinformatics to develop a novel methodological approach to a critical question at the forefront of genomic research.         n/a",Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dynamics,7176152,R01HG003354,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Class', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Light', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Names', 'Numbers', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Today', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'computer program', 'design', 'functional genomics', 'gene interaction', 'genome-wide analysis', 'insight', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'size', 'software development', 'statistics']",NHGRI,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL CORPORATION,R01,2007,305165,0.017207688750858745
"Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposed study will build upon the extensive epidemiologic database and specimen repository derived from an ongoing bladder cancer study entitled ""Genetic Susceptibility to Bladder Cancer: A Molecular Epidemiologic Approach"" (RO1 CA74880, PI: Xifeng Wu). The parent grant involved a multidisciplinary group of researchers applying a molecular epidemiologic approach to identify inter-individual differences in susceptibility to bladder carcinogenesis, with a focus on genes involved in protecting against genomic instability, such as DNA repair, cell cycle, and telomere maintenance. It is increasing recognized that inflammation plays an important role in the etiology of many cancers, including bladder cancer (BC). We have recently shown that an IL-6 promoter SNP (G-174C) is associated with BC risk and progression. In this application, we will test the hypothesis that BC is modulated by common, low penetrance polymorphisms in inflammation related genes, interacting with each other and/or environmental factors. We will take a pathway based genotyping approach and apply novel statistical tools to address the hypothesis. There are 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify candidate polymorphisms in inflammation related genes that predispose individuals to BC. We plan to perform genotyping of a comprehensive list of potential functional polymorphisms in inflammation genes (85 polymorphisms in 44 genes) on 1000 Caucasian cases and 1000 controls matched on age, gender, and ethnicity. Specific Aim 2: To perform genotyping on tagging SNPs for the top 8 candidate genes that were identified in Specific Aim 1 (using a significance level of 0.1) identified in Specific Aim 1. This will give us a complete picture of the role that the specific gene plays in BC etiology. We will implement haplotype-based analyses to identify any additional variants that might have been missed using individual SNP-based approaches. Specific Aim 3: To apply hierarchical models to refine risk assessment and to apply novel machine-learning tools to identify any gene-environment and gene- gene interactions influencing risk for BC. These analyses will examine SNP main effects and gene-gene interactions, gene-environment interaction and develop and validate algorithms, which will identify individuals at highest risk for BC, given their personal exposure patterns and their genetic risk profiles. The application will allow us to have a comprehensive picture of the effects of functional polymorphisms in inflammation related genes on BC risk.          n/a",Polymorphisms in Inflammation Genes and Bladder Cancer Risk,7320980,R03CA130063,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Erythrocytes', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-6', 'Length', 'Literature', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutagens', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Significance Level', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Suspension substance', 'Suspensions', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis', 'college', 'follow-up', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene interaction', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'promoter', 'repository', 'telomere', 'tool']",NCI,UT MD ANDERSON CANCER CTR,R03,2007,77000,0.011292712186033765
"Statistical and Computational Methods for Systematically Mining the SNP and Gene     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This application is submitted in response to PAR-04-159 ``Small Grants Program for Cancer Epidemiology'' `Analyzing existing data that otherwise may have gone unexplored, such as pooled analysis of data from multiple studies coordinated into consortia.' A quick review of research articles in current literature, there are only tens of paper related to cancer study with integrated SNP and gene expression data. The lack of algorithms and user-friendly software to mine the existing data may be partly blamed. The proposed study will provide useful tools to mine the genetic data from different sources. This pilot project focuses on developing efficient algorithms for clustering, molecular network construction, and biomarker discovery with integrated SNP and gene expression data. With the efficient data mining methods we develop, cancer researchers may get much more useful information from the otherwise unexplored data. Therefore it has broad implications in the analysis of all high priority areas in cancer epidemiology research identified by Progress Review Groups, such as multiple myeloma and cancers of the breast, colon/rectum, prostate, lung, pancreas, and brain, and linking genetic polymorphisms with other variable related to cancer risk. Upon complete the proposed research, the methods/algorithms developed can potentially be applied to other mixed data sources such as methylation, gene expression, and others.

"The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        This competing renewal application requests five years of support for the Conte Center for the Neuroscience of Mental Disorders (CCNMD): The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior. The Surgeon General notes, that 30,000 suicides per year in the United States and ten times that number of suicide attempts, requires a response that involves improving our knowledge regarding the relative importance of multiple predictors of suicide risk. The CCNMD employs a multidisciplinary approach to develop a predictive and explanatory model for suicidal behavior. Project 1: In the brainstem of depressed suicides we have found more serotonin neurons, more TPH, less serotonin transporter expression and 5-HT1A binding, all effects that enhance activity. The brainstem changes may be a response to less serotonin input and lower neurodensity in ventral prefrontal cortex of suicide and that may underlie increased impulsivity and suicide risk. We plan to map the circuitry of suicide by adding studies of anterior cingulate and amygdala, and to study neuron survival in prefrontal cortex. Project 2: Microarray analysis of the transcriptome in the same brain regions as Project 1 will map altered gene expression and be compared to murine models in Projects 6 and 7. Project 3: CCNMD investigators have successfully tested a predictive stress-diathesis model where suicidal ideation is a proximal predictor and lifetime aggressivity/impulsivity is a trait predictor of suicide attempts in major depression. We now propose to evaluate potential causal factors (genes and adverse childhood experiences) and an intermediate biological phenotype, the HPA axis in a prospective study. Project 4: We will use PET to determine whether the postmortem receptor changes differentially associated with major depression and suicide can be distinguished in vivo. Effects of susceptibility gene expression on binding to 5-HTT, 5-HTiA and MAOA will be determined by PET and related to depression and suicidal behavior. Project 5 builds on our familial transmission results. This bottom-up familial transmission study will examine suicidality, aggression/impulsivity, serotonin susceptibility genes, and psychopathology in very high-risk families with depressed adolescent attempter probands. Projects 6 and 7 involve murine models of depression and aggression related to single genes and an inbred strain. Effects of altered gene expression at critical phases and of maternal deprivation on behavior, brain morphology, gene expression profiles, neurogenesis and biochemistry will be evaluated and compared with clinical findings. Project 8 proposed use of statistical model selection for suicide prediction and analysis of large postmortem and in vivo imaging data sets using statistical learning theory that allows the flexible fitting of models with many predictors.       n/a",The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior,7249470,P50MH062185,"['Adolescent', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'HPSE gene', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Inbred Strain', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Maternal Deprivation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methaqualone', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Numbers', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Serotonin', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Surgeon', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'brain morphology', 'experience', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neurogenesis', 'proband', 'receptor', 'response', 'serotonin transporter', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,P50,2007,2152844,-0.032922293810621304
"Comparative Genomics to Identify Functional Blocks & HGT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the genomes of more and more species are sequenced it has become apparent that 1 of the most powerful techniques for detemining region function in the human genome is by comparison to the genomes of other species. The implications of such understanding for disease diagnosis and specialized drug and vaccine design are dear. Similarly, genomic comparison between bacteria can reveal regions which are functionally important in the development of infectious diseases and again aid drug and vaccine design. This project has 2 primary research goals. One (1) is the development of methodology for finding functionally predictive signatures of non-coding sequences (NCS) highly conserved across multiple species, and the other is to develop novel approaches for defecting Horizontal Gene Transfer (HG'T). The comparison of genomes is the common thread in this research. ln pursuit of their first goal, the investigators plan to integrate genomic sequence data, provided by their collaborators, with experimental and literature data, such as microarray-expression data, GO-functional-annotation for nearby genes, and ChlP-Chip data. The results will be used to evaluate the functional relevance, if any, of each NCS and then to define a signature predictive of function in terms of measurable covariates and sequence structure. For instance, if a sequence signature characterizes NCS whose nearest genes contribute to a particular function then an unknown gene close to an NCS with the same signature would be a prime candidate for interrogation of that function. The Investigators propose to attack this problem  by 1). Developing non standard types of clustering methods based on supervised learning algorithms, e.g., Random Forests, 2) Representing the NCS by the parameters of a stochastic model and determining appropriate thresholds for model fitting by using resampling and other Monte Carlo methods. Under the second topic, the investigators propose 2 different approaches for determining whether functionaIly significant FGT has occurred in bacteria. The first approach is to take a known functionally important famlly (NIFgenes) for which HGT is a matter of dispute, and devise quantitative measures which they expect will enable a firm conclusion. They intend to refine similarity measures between genes in different species ,such as BLAST scores, corrected for evolutionary distance. They will compute these measures for pairs of NIF genes in different species, pairs, pairs of genes known to be HGT (antibiotic immunity conferring genes) and genes very unlikely to be HGT (ribosomal proteins). The second approach is to look for anomalously long stretches of 16s RNA conserved within substantial subsets of bacterial species which are otherwise only distantly related.  Mathematical and statistical challenge include: Under approach I, standardizing comparisons of genes with different mutation rates; devising an appropriate classifier for HGT vs. non HGT, and computing appropriate estimates of the probability of classifying a gene as HGT when it isn't and vice versa; Under approach II, extending existing methods for detecting large inclusions by taking into account phylogenetic tree topology and branch lengths.            n/a",Comparative Genomics to Identify Functional Blocks & HGT,7240439,R01GM075312,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blast Cell', 'Boxing', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Disputes', 'Distant', 'Drops', 'Exhibits', 'Functional RNA', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Markov Chains', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nif Genes', 'None or Not Applicable', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Planning Techniques', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal Proteins', 'Saccharomycetales', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Score', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Tetraodontidae', 'Thinking', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'density', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'heuristics', 'markov model', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'prototype', 'size', 'statistics', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'willingness']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2007,163829,0.023345262912428447

"Genetical Genomics Analysis Software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Response to drug treatment is thought dependent upon genotype for many modern therapies. Knowledge of how each genotype responds to a particular therapy is bene?cial only in that one can identify portions of the population which cannot reap the benefits of said treatment. A better course of action is to identify not only which genotype responds, or not, to a particular therapy, but to identify which region of the genome is responding, or not, and how. We believe that this information will lead to new drug targets and better therapies that benefit a larger portion of the population. The goal of this proposal is to provide a suite of software tools for genetic and genomic scientists performing gene mapping experiments with genomic data as the response variable. These tools will ideally provide functionality for 1) detecting polymorphic regions of the genome that con- fer transcript expression differences, 2) identify polymorphic regions of the genome that impart expression differences in genes located elsewhere in the genome, and 3) detecting interactions between loci that may correspond to epistatic effects on transcription. Some software already exists to perform each of these tasks as distinct independent solutions. This proposal intends to produce an integrated solution, S+EQTL (S-PLUS for expression quantitative trait loci mapping), that utilizes the power of S-PLUS and both incorporates and extends the functionality of an exist- ing genetics suite. By providing scientists with an integrated set of tools for genomics experiments with a genetic component, more productive time can be spent interpreting the results rather than transforming data into different formats to be processed by multiple software analysis packages. This software should also address one of the most dif?cult aspects of genetical genomics exper- iments, the so called curse of dimensionality. As the genomics community continues gathering knowledge of transcripts in various organisms, the arrays that interrogate transcript abundance only grow larger in the number of transcript species included. In the absence of tools designed for this purpose, the research scientist is left with the option of either focusing on a narrow set of previously known genes or performing a grid-wise search on all genes in the array. The former is not interesting as these genes are likely well studied and may provide little novel insight. The latter is computationally demanding and may not be possible on the new, larger arrays. A recent publication presents a novel solution that may be enhanced to gain both power and scale using Bayesian methodology. Knowledge of how each genotype responds to a particular drug therapy is beneficial only in that one can identify portions of the population which cannot reap the benefits of said treatment. A better course of action is to identify not only which genotype responds, or not, to a particular therapy, but to identify which region of the genome is responding, or not, and how. We believe that the development of analytic tools for gene mapping experiments to identify this information will lead to new drug targets and better therapies that benefit a larger portion of the population.          n/a",Genetical Genomics Analysis Software,7216142,R43GM079852,"['Address', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Genetics', 'Anus', 'Arizona', 'Bioconductor', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Cations', 'Cattle', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Con-fer', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Department of Defense', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Exons', 'Family suidae', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Government Agencies', 'Graph', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investments', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Nebraska', 'North Carolina', 'Numbers', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmaceutical Services', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Purpose', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Sus scrofa', 'Techniques', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thermogenesis', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'animal breeding', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'expression vector', 'genetic pedigree', 'hazard', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'lecturer', 'novel', 'professor', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'skills', 'software development', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,INSIGHTFUL CORPORATION,R43,2007,101707,0.010681979612529053
"System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to the NIH call for Exploratory Collaborations with National Centers for Biomedical Computing, PAR-06-223, and it will involve a collaboration between Columbia University's MAGNet NCBC and a team at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The aim of the proposal is a system-wide tudy of integrated transcriptional and metabolic networks in Eschericia coli K-12 strain, aiming at a similar analysis of a pathogen, Bacillus anthracis, at a later date. LANL hosts an experimental research program on bacterial metabolomics. Metabolites serve several functions. The most common one is being the precursors to various cellular components. They are also regulators of cellular functions by means of modulating metabolic reactions or binding to transcription factors and subsequently regulating gene expression. Conversely, the genes regulated by a transcription factor often encode enzymes, modulating the speed of metabolic reactions. Thus, to understand and ultimately predict the cellular response to an environmental change of interest (e.g., pathogen entry into its host environment), we must integrate the analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome. To address this need, we will work with the laboratories of Pat Unkefer and John Dunbar, which will produce data sets of about 300 joint metabolic/transcriptional profiles of E.coli under different steady-state growth conditions. The resources of MAGnet NCBC, specifically the algorithms within the geWorkbench bioinformatics platform produced by the center, will be leveraged to reconstruct cellular networks. Specifically, we expect that ARACNE, an algorithm originally developed by MAGNet for high-fidelity analysis of transcriptional networks in mammalian cells, is well positioned for reconstruction of metabolic networks from high throughput system-wide metabolic activity data, provide that appropriate modifications to deal with the specifics of the metabolic data are made. We will also adapt the algorithm to discover modulated interactions, that is, metabolic interactions that are conditional on the activity of a modulator gene (enzyme), or transcriptional interactions that require the presence of a metabolite to proceed. Such integrated genome/metabolome analysis has not been attempted yet. It will be a giant leap towards a complete understanding of cellular processes in an important organism. Because of the comparatively small size of bacterial genomes and metabolomes, it will be possible to perform system-wide analyses of interactions for the entire integrated genome and metabolome. While important in its own right, especially in view of the pathogenic nature of B. anthracis, this research would also represent an important test bed for a subsequent study of metabolic diseases in higher animals, including humans.           n/a",System-wide Study of Transcriptional Control of Metabolism,7234993,R21GM080216,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacillus anthracis', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Concentration measurement', 'Condition', 'Crystallography', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Documentation', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Gene', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mails', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Control', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Multimedia', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source Code', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virulence', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'biomedical informatics', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'design', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'forging', 'hazard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'size', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,LOS ALAMOS NAT SECTY-LOS ALAMOS NAT LAB,R21,2007,257655,-0.005133539541952557
"Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an urgent need for novel anti-malaria interventions, due to the growing resistance of Plasmodium parasites to available drugs. The long-term objective of our research is to identify potential drug or vaccine targets using an efficient and cost-effective data-mining approach. This proposed study is aimed at the identification of biological networks as the first step toward a systems-level understanding of parasite biology. Compared to functional genomics, which requires a priori information about the identity or function of targets, a systems-level understanding of parasite biology will allow us to identify targets based on their key roles in networks. Specific aim 1 focuses on the harvest of data relevant to three gene families: the proteases, transporters, and transcription factors that are essential components in cellular networks for parasite growth and infection. Our project will encompass genomic data, expression data, and data derived from other high throughput experiments and bioinformatic and statistical analyses. Specific aim 2 focuses on the integration and encapsulation of these data in the form of network models. The models will be inferred using probabilistic graphical methods drawn from the field of engineering. Specific aim 3 focuses on the exploration of these models, particularly in the light of data from wet lab gene mapping and drug resistance experiments. Our ""biological maps"" will enable the visualization of evolutionary forces driving changes in the parasite's phenotype and should allow us to identify network design weaknesses in the parasite--potential vulnerabilities that could result in new malarial control strategies.           n/a",Systems Biology of Plasmodium falciparum: Building and Exploring Network Models,7287978,SC1GM081068,"['Animal Model', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Be++ element', 'Beryllium', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Digestion', 'Discipline', 'Drug resistance', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Endopeptidases', 'Engineering', 'Family', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hemoglobin', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Location', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Plasmodium', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcription Factor 3', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'driving force', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'research study', 'response', 'stem', 'theories', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,SC1,2007,247625,0.023678464765759837
"Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Understanding how the phenotype of an organism is produced by its genotype and environment is fundamental to modern biomedicine. Cellular biochemistry forms the best-characterized complex biochemical system available, and provides a unique opportunity to better understand the structure-function relationships that produce phenotypes. Understood mathematically, cells are a biochemical network whose topology, function, and possible behaviors are only still only dimly understood.

"Clinical & Microarray Data Predict Lung Cancer Outcomes Patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) have a poor prognosis.

"Genetic Network Inference with Combinational Phenotypes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The reverse engineering of cellular genetic circuits from gene expression data is an important and scientifically challenging problem. When applied to system more complex than a yeast cell, however, most of the approaches for reverse engineering are limited by their reliance on a significant number of ad-hoc perturbation, such as gene knockout.  We propose to address these issues and to attempt to reconstruct the genetic circuitry of human B-cells by coupling three distinct components: 1) an information theoretic method for the inference of cellular networks from microarray profile data for a large number of distinct cellular and molecular phenotypes 2) A synthetic network simulation framework for the assessment of the performance of the reverse engineering under a variety of constraints and conditions, such as noise and network complexity. 3) An adaptive learning method that will iteratively apply optimal perturbations to the biological system, which will allow refining the cellular network model over time.  Furthermore, we propose to biologically validate this approach by elucidating the cellular networks of human B lymphocytes, from a variety of normal, tumor-derived, and experimentally manipulated B cell phenotypes, which are significant both from an oncological and immunological perspective. This will be accomplished by analyzing an existing set of over 340 high-quality microarray expression profiles.  Finally, we will create a software platform to reverse engineer any biological system for which adequate microarray data is available. The platform will also allow to design and perform virtual, in-silico gene perturbation experiments. n/a",Genetic Network Inference with Combinational Phenotypes,7082976,R01CA109755,"['B lymphocyte', 'artificial intelligence', 'cellular oncology', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'cytogenetics', 'functional /structural genomics', 'gene expression profiling', 'genetic models', 'human data', 'lymphoma', 'microarray technology', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular genetics', 'molecular oncology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'nucleic acid structure', 'statistics /biometry']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,373483,0.01997321178280692

A weighted permutation scheme is proposed to improve permutation-based inference procedures, and these methods will be compared with several recently proposed parametric and semi-parametric methods.

CBC will be compared with other state-of-the-art supervised machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines and random forests.

"Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dyanamics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microarray technology enables investigators to simultaneously measure the expression of thousands of genes and holds the promise to cast new light onto the regulatory mechanisms of the genome. A main avenue of experimental investigation, leveraging on this technology, is based on the temporal dissection of cellular mechanisms. Temporal experiments offer the possibility of observing these mechanisms in action and to break down the genome into sets of genes involved in the same processes. The overall goal of this project is to develop an unsupervised approach and an integrated software environment to automatically discover regulatory mechanisms from temporal microarray experiments. The hypothesis underpinning our approach is that complex interaction patterns can be identified through analysis of conditional rather than marginal gene expression profiles. This novel approach also provides principled guidance to experimental design and sampling strategies, and it naturally extends to a large class of statistical models, able to capture a wider range of dynamic behaviors and experimental designs. We plan to develop a comprehensive framework to design and analyze microarray data collected through temporal experiments. This framework will be used to specify and answer the critical design questions of sample size and sampling frequency determination. Using this framework, we will develop a new model-based approach and an iterative search algorithm, called Conditional Clustering, to identify different patterns of behavior determined by a set of genes through the analysis of the behavior of a gene given a set of other genes, rather than the behavior of each gene in isolation. We will implement this design and analysis framework in a computer program that will be distributed over the Internet.This project brings together researchers in artificial intelligence, theoretical statistics and experimental design with a long track record of methodological contributions to bioinformatics to develop a novel methodological approach to a critical question at the forefront of genomic research.         n/a",Decoding Gene Expression Control Using Conditional Clustering by Dyanamics,7033620,R01HG003354,"['behavior', 'computer program /software', 'experimental designs', 'gene expression', 'genes', 'genome', 'mathematical model', 'model']",NHGRI,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BOSTON,R01,2006,325000,0.017292042592128083
"In Silico Analysis of Ocular Genes and Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in computation and high-throughput methods of biomedical data collection have created tremendous opportunities to advance our understanding of visual physiology. We will test the hypothesis that genes and their protein products expressed in ocular tissues can be analyzed in silico using statistical and machine learning techniques and create knowledge regarding ocular gene regulation, structure and function. In particular, these studies will produce testable predictions that may be validated by bench experiments. A primary goal will be to characterize the regulatory elements that govern gene expression in ocular cells. In addition, these tools will be used to characterize ocular protein structure, particularly structure/function relationships and to make predictions about secondary and tertiary structure. Finally, in silico methods will be used to analyze the gene/protein networks that carry out cellular functions such as metabolism, signal transduction and regulation of gone expression. The following specific questions will be addressed in this research:      1) Can computational and statistical methods be used to identify DNA sequences that regulate   ocular gene expression? Can these sequences be used to identify new, uncharacterized   genes in the human genome?      2) Can these methods be used to predict protein structural features in both health and disease   states?      3) Can gene/protein functional networks be elucidated in silico by the use of advanced   analytical and modeling techniques?      This proposal describes a four year training program that aims to develop the independent research abilities of the PI, and to prepare for a career as an individual investigator in computational biology and translational medicine.         n/a",In Silico Analysis of Ocular Genes and Proteins,7082121,K08EY014665,"['DNA binding protein', 'biological signal transduction', 'computational biology', 'eye', 'functional /structural genomics', 'gene expression', 'genetic library', 'genetic regulation', 'genetic regulatory element', 'glycoproteins', 'mathematical model', 'metabolism', 'molecular biology information system', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'protein structure function', 'serial analysis of gene expression', 'silicon compounds', 'statistics /biometry', 'trabecular meshwork', 'vision']",NEI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K08,2006,42432,-0.023106602670776032

"Clinical & Microarray Data Predict Lung Cancer Outcomes Patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) have a poor prognosis. Our goal is to develop methods to translate gene expression profiles into knowledge that will lead to the identification of molecular targets for prediction and therapy in these patients. Current clinical (staging) models for prediction of survival in these patients with small, localized tumors (Stage I) fails to identify the subset that will die less than 2.5 years after ""curative"" surgery. Our preliminary research with rule-based models using Stage I lung adenocarcinoma patients demonstrates meaningful results for prediction of survival with models that combine gene expression data with clinical data. Our primary hypothesis is: Clinical and gene expression attributes combine in rule-based models to accurately predict patient outcomes (time to death or recurrence). We propose to test this hypothesis for patients with resectable NSCLC. The Specific Aims are to: 1. Test the accuracy of the rule-based models as a function of the data type. We will use several established algorithms for generating decision rule models. Leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) will be used to evaluate model accuracy, complexity, and stability.

"Genetic Network Inference with Combinational Phenotypes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The reverse engineering of cellular genetic circuits from gene expression data is an important and scientifically challenging problem. When applied to system more complex than a yeast cell, however, most of the approaches for reverse engineering are limited by their reliance on a significant number of ad-hoc perturbation, such as gene knockout.  We propose to address these issues and to attempt to reconstruct the genetic circuitry of human B-cells by coupling three distinct components: 1) an information theoretic method for the inference of cellular networks from microarray profile data for a large number of distinct cellular and molecular phenotypes 2) A synthetic network simulation framework for the assessment of the performance of the reverse engineering under a variety of constraints and conditions, such as noise and network complexity. 3) An adaptive learning method that will iteratively apply optimal perturbations to the biological system, which will allow refining the cellular network model over time.  Furthermore, we propose to biologically validate this approach by elucidating the cellular networks of human B lymphocytes, from a variety of normal, tumor-derived, and experimentally manipulated B cell phenotypes, which are significant both from an oncological and immunological perspective. This will be accomplished by analyzing an existing set of over 340 high-quality microarray expression profiles.  Finally, we will create a software platform to reverse engineer any biological system for which adequate microarray data is available. The platform will also allow to design and perform virtual, in-silico gene perturbation experiments. n/a",Genetic Network Inference with Combinational Phenotypes,6925178,R01CA109755,"['B lymphocyte', 'artificial intelligence', 'cellular oncology', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'cytogenetics', 'functional /structural genomics', 'gene expression profiling', 'genetic models', 'human data', 'lymphoma', 'microarray technology', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular genetics', 'molecular oncology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'nucleic acid structure', 'statistics /biometry']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2005,387233,0.01997321178280692
"Statistical Methods for Genomic and Proteomic Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose developing, evaluating and comparing statistical methods in analyzing and interpreting microarray data, including a heart failure dataset collected in the co-Principal Investigator's lab. Some of the proposed methods will incorporate or be applied to other types of genomic or proteomic data. In Aim A.1, we consider detecting differential gene expression. A weighted permutation scheme is proposed to improve permutation-based inference procedures, and these methods will be compared with several recently proposed parametric and semi-parametric methods. We also propose incorporating existing biological data in the statistical methods. In Aim A.2, we study a clustering-based classification (CBC) method for gene function prediction using microarray data. CBC will be compared with other state-of-the-art supervised machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines and random forests. Other sources of biological data, such as protein-protein interaction data, will be incorporated in the proposed method. In Aim A.3, we consider sample classification and prediction based on gene expression profiles in a general framework called penalized partial least squares (PPLS). PPLS will be compared with other supervised machine learning algorithms. We will extend PPLS to combine microarray data from multiple studies.

"The Molecular Pathogenesis of Health Disparities in Inf* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of preterm labor have been well documented, but the relative impact of genetic predisposition, as compared to environmental and behavioral factors is not known. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that differential gene expression contributes to disparity in infection-associated preterm labor. A second objective is the creation of two large and novel resources for studying preterm labor: (1) a database of candidate critical genes, and, (2) a human gene expression tissue bank. We suggest that elucidating the pathophysiology of preterm labor requires the power to perform analyses of the fetomaternal interactions required for parturition on a genomic scale. For practical and ethical reasons, a primary study of this type in humans would be severely limited. Therefore, in the first phase of this project, we will use a validated, tightly controlled murine model of infection-induced preterm labor to generate a comprehensive catalogue of gene expression over time in multiple tissues. Preterm pregnant mice will be randomized to treatment groups modeling one of clinical conditions: A. infection with labor; B. infection without labor; C. labor without infection; and D. no infection/no labor. RNA will then be collected from myometrium, ovaries, decidua, placentas and fetal membranes from each of the groups in a time series, and the relative expression of thousands of genes will be analyzed in these samples using DNA microarrays. A similarity metric and a clustering algorithm will be used to categorize individual genes by temporal expression patterns. A novel subtractive strategy will allow us to differentiate transcripts active specifically in infection-induced from those important for infection or labor alone. Inferences will be drawn regarding the involvement of genes not physic represented in the micro arrays by mapping into known functional pathways. The final result of this analysis will be a ""short list"" of candidate genes with potentially critical roles in infection-induced labor. In the second phase of the project, we analyze human tissues (myometrium, placenta, chorion, amnion, decidua, amniocytes and blood) collected from approximately 1360 patients presenting in term and preterm labor in a cross-sectional case-control study matching for race. Expression analysis in these tissues will be targeted to the human homologues of the enriched list of candidate critical genes identified in the mouse. Differential gene expression in pre term labor with or without infection and premature rupture membranes, as well as among different racial groups, will be characterized. A computational tool known as a support vector machine will be used to generate a rank order list predictive of preterm delivery, taking into account historical, clinical and laboratory variables. This tool will identify the subset(s) of genes most likely to form the genetic basis of preterm labor, and may provide a diagnostic molecular profiling instrument for predicting preterm delivery.

"Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Understanding how the phenotype of an organism is produced by its genotype and environment is fundamental to modern biomedicine. Cellular biochemistry forms the best-characterized complex biochemical system available, and provides a unique opportunity to better understand the structure-function relationships that produce phenotypes. Understood mathematically, cells are a biochemical network whose topology, function, and possible behaviors are only still only dimly understood.      Our previous work has resulted in the development of several databases (END, BND, Klotho) and software systems (The Agora, Glossa) to provide, accumulate, and use data on biochemical networks by users worldwide. In this application for competitive renewal, we propose to embark on a systematic study of structure-function relationships in biochemical networks, focusing on the discovery of patterns of biochemical function --- functional motives. We will identify these motives and their distribution over all enzymatic reactions by comparing changes in reactants' structures and enzymes' specificities, rather than just examine keywords. This systematic examination will allow us to determine, at much greater resolution than ever before, what functions each molecule and reaction have. To do this we must significantly extend the functionalities of our current systems in three major ways. First, we will add significant new data on the structure of small molecules of biochemical interest, enzymatic reactions, the mechanisms of gene expression, and dementia. Second, we will further develop and test methods that produce semantic interoperability among independent, disparate databases. Third, we will develop algorithms to detect and catalogue patterns of biochemical function among thousands of reactions and molecules; to more speedily enumerate paths among molecules and subnets in the biochemical network; to determine the extent of convergent evolution among enzymes; to trace atoms through a sequence of reactions such as a metabolic pathway; and to suggest novel biochemical reactions. We will use these capabilities to define and search for functional motives among enzymatic reactions, testing their correlation with network topology and dynamics, and to estimate the extent to which functional similarities arise from convergent evolution of enzymes. n/a",Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases,6784554,R01GM056529,"['artificial intelligence', 'biochemistry', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'dementia', 'enzyme mechanism', 'functional /structural genomics', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular dynamics', 'physiology', 'protein structure function']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2004,522252,0.009333506638793405

We propose here a mechanism for translating these discoveries into cost-effective, quantitative assays based on the use of highly multiplexed, universal-primer-driven rtPCR (UP-rtPCR). In this proposal we will demonstrate and validate the combined use of artificial neural network analysis for identification of small gene signatures and UP-rtPCR technology for translating these signatures into high throughput assays for use in research and clinical settings.

Machine learning techniques applied to gene expression data have been used to address the questions of distinguishing tumor morphology, predicting post-treatment outcome, and finding molecular markers for disease. While these studies have been very promising, significant challenges remain. Extracting biological knowledge from microarray-based gene expression data is difficult. The development of robust and accurate expression-based classifiers of biological and clinical states is similarly problematic. Biologists do not have access to an integrated set of robust, sophisticated analytical tools.  Our goal is to develop, implement, and distribute computational genomics methods that address these challenges in the gene expression profiling field.  Aim 1: Capture the behavior of a set of genes representing a pathway or state of the cell to reduce a list of thousands of expressed genes into a few hundred metagenes. Metagenes should filter the noise, technical variation, and idiosyncrasies of the data, and capture the actual molecular logic or relevant biological correlations and structure in the data.  Aim 2: Develop a robust and validated computational methodology for using metagene markers for classification.  Aim 3: Develop and distribute an integrated software package, GenePattern, to put the power of sophisticated computational methods into the hands of the biomedical research community.  Our extensive experience developing methods, analyzing patient sample data, and creating and distributing software tools for this area of research makes us well suited to carry out this program. n/a",GenePattern: Methodologies and Software Tools.,6756446,R33CA097556,"['analytical method', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'form /pattern perception', 'functional /structural genomics', 'gene expression', 'genetic library', 'genetic screening', 'mathematical model', 'method development', 'microarray technology', 'molecular shape', 'phenotype', 'technology /technique development']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R33,2004,535007,0.054013002405485525
"Integrated SNP, gene expression and proteomic analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will see development of a software suite (Genetrix) comprised of tools for data management, visualization, machine learning, statistical analysis and biologic interpretation of data from the large-scale biological platforms (gene expression, SNP and proteomics), in conjunction with ancillary clinical, demographic, epidemiological, laboratory and outcome data.       The bioinformatics challenges of the new large-scale biotechnologies and formidable: efficient mining of biologically- and clinically-relevant information requires coordinated contributions from computer scientists, statisticians, mathematicians, biologists and clinicians. The potential benefits however, are also substantial as evidenced by the rapidly growing use of gene expression rnicroarrays. The complexities, and payoffs, will increase dramatically as scientists begin to integrate SNP/proteomic data and gene expression data, and there will be demand for a new generation of software to meet this challenge.       Genetrix will include algorithms to pre-process and normalize raw data to reduce noise, will provide a flexible, interactive and intuitive graphical interface, will support unsupervised and supervised for classification, and for dichotomous or survival outcome prediction, using appropriate statistic methods as well as proven machine learning heuristics, and will have extensive biological information integrated into the software, and available directly from Web resources. n/a","Integrated SNP, gene expression and proteomic analysis",6689832,R43HG002696,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' gene expression', ' genetic polymorphism', ' genetic screening', ' human data', ' informatics', ' information systems', ' mathematics', ' proteomics']",NHGRI,EPICENTER SOFTWARE,R43,2003,68876,0.05764701803683343
"Evolutionary Computation for Gene Expression Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research seeks to develop software that can classify cancers reliably and accurately using gene expression profiling. Published literature has indicated the potential for methods that utilize artificial neural networks for gene expression diagnostic classification and their importance to the research and health communities. The current effort will train and design multilayer feed forward and artificial neural networks using evolutionary optimization techniques for cancer cell class prediction and discovery as well as understanding of the dynamics of gene interaction in a cell. These methods for training and designing neural networks will provide an effective computer-based automatic system that can be used for gene expression profiling. Success in this research will provide the basis for developing a prototype neural network classification and profiling system in Phase II as a commercial application. This will increase the efficiency and efficacy of methods used for screening and diagnosing cancers and increase the likelihood of successful treatment. In Phase II, the prototype system will be made user-friendly so that microarray analysts will be able to interpret the results of the neural network with ease and have confidence in its performance.

"Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Understanding how the phenotype of an organism is produced by its genotype and environment is fundamental to modern biomedicine. Cellular biochemistry forms the best-characterized complex biochemical system available, and provides a unique opportunity to better understand the structure-function relationships that produce phenotypes. Understood mathematically, cells are a biochemical network whose topology, function, and possible behaviors are only still only dimly understood.      Our previous work has resulted in the development of several databases (END, BND, Klotho) and software systems (The Agora, Glossa) to provide, accumulate, and use data on biochemical networks by users worldwide. In this application for competitive renewal, we propose to embark on a systematic study of structure-function relationships in biochemical networks, focusing on the discovery of patterns of biochemical function --- functional motives. We will identify these motives and their distribution over all enzymatic reactions by comparing changes in reactants' structures and enzymes' specificities, rather than just examine keywords. This systematic examination will allow us to determine, at much greater resolution than ever before, what functions each molecule and reaction have. To do this we must significantly extend the functionalities of our current systems in three major ways. First, we will add significant new data on the structure of small molecules of biochemical interest, enzymatic reactions, the mechanisms of gene expression, and dementia. Second, we will further develop and test methods that produce semantic interoperability among independent, disparate databases. Third, we will develop algorithms to detect and catalogue patterns of biochemical function among thousands of reactions and molecules; to more speedily enumerate paths among molecules and subnets in the biochemical network; to determine the extent of convergent evolution among enzymes; to trace atoms through a sequence of reactions such as a metabolic pathway; and to suggest novel biochemical reactions. We will use these capabilities to define and search for functional motives among enzymatic reactions, testing their correlation with network topology and dynamics, and to estimate the extent to which functional similarities arise from convergent evolution of enzymes. n/a",Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases,6694513,R01GM056529,"['artificial intelligence', ' biochemistry', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' dementia', ' enzyme mechanism', ' functional /structural genomics', ' information system analysis', ' mathematical model', ' molecular biology information system', ' molecular dynamics', ' physiology', ' protein structure function']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2003,556670,0.009333506638793405
"Predicting gene attributes from patterns of annotations. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Gene Ontology Consortium produces a controlled vocabulary for annotation of gene functions, which has been adopted by many organism-specific gene annotation databases. This allows the prediction of gene function based on partial annotation: if two attributes are strongly correlated in a database, then the presence of one attribute is evidence for the presence of the other. Recent ideas from machine learning, such as dependency networks, may allow more complicated interdependencies between genes and their attributes to be modeled efficiently, which should enable better predictions to be made. Cross-validation will be used to assess the performance of these models, in comparison with linear models and baseline models in which attributes are assumed to be independent. This approach will also be integrated with a probabilistic model of annotation-transfer based on sequence similarity. n/a",Predicting gene attributes from patterns of annotations.,6626288,F32HG002552,"['computer data analysis', ' computer graphics /printing', ' functional /structural genomics', ' genetic models', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' molecular biology information system', ' postdoctoral investigator']",NHGRI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY (MEDICAL SCHOOL),F32,2003,46420,0.03442676635606605
"The Molecular Pathogenesis of Health Disparities in Inf* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of preterm labor have been well documented, but the relative impact of genetic predisposition, as compared to environmental and behavioral factors is not known. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that differential gene expression contributes to disparity in infection-associated preterm labor. A second objective is the creation of two large and novel resources for studying preterm labor: (1) a database of candidate critical genes, and, (2) a human gene expression tissue bank. We suggest that elucidating the pathophysiology of preterm labor requires the power to perform analyses of the fetomaternal interactions required for parturition on a genomic scale. For practical and ethical reasons, a primary study of this type in humans would be severely limited. Therefore, in the first phase of this project, we will use a validated, tightly controlled murine model of infection-induced preterm labor to generate a comprehensive catalogue of gene expression over time in multiple tissues. Preterm pregnant mice will be randomized to treatment groups modeling one of clinical conditions: A. infection with labor; B. infection without labor; C. labor without infection; and D. no infection/no labor. RNA will then be collected from myometrium, ovaries, decidua, placentas and fetal membranes from each of the groups in a time series, and the relative expression of thousands of genes will be analyzed in these samples using DNA microarrays. A similarity metric and a clustering algorithm will be used to categorize individual genes by temporal expression patterns. A novel subtractive strategy will allow us to differentiate transcripts active specifically in infection-induced from those important for infection or labor alone. Inferences will be drawn regarding the involvement of genes not physic represented in the micro arrays by mapping into known functional pathways. The final result of this analysis will be a ""short list"" of candidate genes with potentially critical roles in infection-induced labor. In the second phase of the project, we analyze human tissues (myometrium, placenta, chorion, amnion, decidua, amniocytes and blood) collected from approximately 1360 patients presenting in term and preterm labor in a cross-sectional case-control study matching for race. Expression analysis in these tissues will be targeted to the human homologues of the enriched list of candidate critical genes identified in the mouse. Differential gene expression in pre term labor with or without infection and premature rupture membranes, as well as among different racial groups, will be characterized. A computational tool known as a support vector machine will be used to generate a rank order list predictive of preterm delivery, taking into account historical, clinical and laboratory variables. This tool will identify the subset(s) of genes most likely to form the genetic basis of preterm labor, and may provide a diagnostic molecular profiling instrument for predicting preterm delivery. The large databases generated in this study will be valuable to any researcher interested in parturition and will be made accessible on the Internet. n/a",The Molecular Pathogenesis of Health Disparities in Inf*,6654496,R01HD041689,"['DNA', ' Escherichia coli', ' RNA', ' bacteria infection mechanism', ' decidua', ' disease /disorder model', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' embryo /fetus membrane', ' epidemiology', ' female', ' gene expression', ' genetic susceptibility', ' human tissue', ' induced labor', ' infection', ' laboratory mouse', ' microarray technology', ' molecular biology information system', ' myometrium', ' ovary', ' pathologic process', ' placenta', ' premature labor', ' racial /ethnic difference', ' tissue /cell culture']",NICHD,EVANSTON NORTHWESTERN HEALTHCARE,R01,2003,300000,0.057561454961192415

"In Silico Analysis of Ocular Genes and Proteins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in computation and high-throughput methods of biomedical data collection have created tremendous opportunities to advance our understanding of visual physiology. We will test the hypothesis that genes and their protein products expressed in ocular tissues can be analyzed in silico using statistical and machine learning techniques and create knowledge regarding ocular gene regulation, structure and function. In particular, these studies will produce testable predictions that may be validated by bench experiments. A primary goal will be to characterize the regulatory elements that govern gene expression in ocular cells. In addition, these tools will be used to characterize ocular protein structure, particularly structure/function relationships and to make predictions about secondary and tertiary structure.

"Cluster Comparison Methods & the NCI Expression Dataset There is a significant commercial and academic need for new tools that provide quantitative cluster comparison metrics. It is important for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to be able to critically evaluate the utility of using different clustering techniques on large high dimensional datasets, in order to make the most informed decisions based upon the clustering results. We propose to evaluate and build bluster comparison metrics, integrating them with high dimensional visualization techniques, so that not only an overall scope, but the cluster distributions can be compared in an intuitive visual fashion.

"CIPER--A NOVEL APOPTOSIS REGULATOR INVOLVED IN CANCER Dysfunction of apoptotic pathways plays a critical role in the development of cancer, and the identification and characterization of genes encoding regulators of apoptosis is therefore critical for understanding the pathophysiology of cancer and for developing novel therapeutic approaches. The laboratory has identified CIPER, a gene that regulates both apoptosis and the NF-kB signal transduction pathway, one which is associated with cell survival. Because of this dual function, CIPER appears to play an important role as the control point of a molecular decision-tree; under some circumstances, CIPER may promote apoptosis, while at other times CIPER may favor cell survival. Importantly, the CIPER gene has been found to be located at the chromosomal breakpoint region of t(1;14), a recurrent translocation associated with MALT B-cell lymphoma, and is frequently mutated in lymphomas of various other histologic types as well as some non-lymphoid neoplasms. Our hypothesis is that CIPER promotes tumor development through a combination of dysregulated apoptosis and NF-kB signaling which result from chromosomal mutations affecting the CIPER gene. We are proposing a series of aims to further define the molecular mechanisms by which CIPER controls these signaling pathways, to understand the cellular stimulae which influence CIPER function, and to explore how natural mutations in the CIPER gene affect its important role as a regulator of cell survival.  n/a",CIPER--A NOVEL APOPTOSIS REGULATOR INVOLVED IN CANCER,6463554,F32CA088470,"['B cell lymphoma', ' apoptosis', ' biological signal transduction', ' chromosome translocation', ' gene mutation', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' neoplastic transformation', ' nuclear factor kappa beta', ' phosphoproteins', ' regulatory gene', ' tissue /cell culture']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F32,2002,33997,-0.021867922703076692

"INTELLIGENT MAPPING OF GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES As a step toward understanding the complex differences between normal and cancer cells, much research has been devoted to analyses of genes that are differentially expressed in particular cells.  Though recent technological advances have made it possible to conduct serial and/or simultaneous analysis of the expression patterns of thousands of genes, no comprehensive study has been reported on how many genes are expressed differentially and whether most differences are cell line-specific.  The long- term goal of this research is to develop intelligent data mapping and visual explanation technologies to improve information exploration and interpretation from high-throughput gene expression profiles for molecular analysis of cancer. Suggested by preliminary evidence from mRNA profiles of breast/prostate cancer cells that transcriptome patterns are rich in information about mechanisms that underlie cancer development, in the R21 research, multidisciplinary knowledge of molecular biology and computational intelligence are applied to (1) design cost effective molecular experiments to establish gene transcriptome distributions across cell lines, (2) pilot test the existence of transcriptome clusters in the molecular species space that correlate to cell phenotypes, and (3) identify key biomarkers that differentiate different cell lines with the highest prediction values.  Since new knowledge can only be further acquired by exploring all of the interesting aspects of complex transcriptome data in high-dimensional space, in this R33 application a statistically principled hierarchical visual exploration technique is proposed to effectively reveal and interpret the intrinsic but hidden characteristics of transcriptome clusters that should better define the nature of cancer biology and therapeutic targets.  A novel integration of information theory and computer graphics will permit (1) an automatic identification and modeling of biomarker clusters, (2) a probabilistic component analysis to form hierarchical visualization spaces allowing the complete data set to be analyzed at the top level with best separated sub-clusters analyzed at deeper levels, and (3) an interactive intelligent interface for task/hypothesis driven data mining and decision making.  The innovative nature of the research relies on the concept of combining (1) a hybrid stepwise nonlinear discriminant analysis for biomarker identification and (2) a hierarchical visual exploration of multi-foci high-dimensional transcriptome distribution to interpret the complex relationships between molecular events and cell phenotypes.  n/a",INTELLIGENT MAPPING OF GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES,6522340,R33CA083231,"['breast neoplasms', ' computer simulation', ' estrogen inhibitor', ' gene expression', ' genetic mapping', ' genetic markers', ' genetic screening', ' genetic transcription', ' information display', ' information theory', ' mathematical model', ' messenger RNA', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' phenotype', ' prostate neoplasms', ' statistics /biometry', ' structural biology', ' technology /technique development', ' transcription factor']",NCI,CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF AMERICA,R33,2002,122438,0.010750946003408871

Therefore, in the first phase of this project, we will use a validated, tightly controlled murine model of infection-induced preterm labor to generate a comprehensive catalogue of gene expression over time in multiple tissues. Preterm pregnant mice will be randomized to treatment groups modeling one of clinical conditions: A. infection with labor; B. infection without labor; C. labor without infection; and D. no infection/no labor. RNA will then be collected from myometrium, ovaries, decidua, placentas and fetal membranes from each of the groups in a time series, and the relative expression of thousands of genes will be analyzed in these samples using DNA microarrays. A similarity metric and a clustering algorithm will be used to categorize individual genes by temporal expression patterns. A novel subtractive strategy will allow us to differentiate transcripts active specifically in infection-induced from those important for infection or labor alone. Inferences will be drawn regarding the involvement of genes not physic represented in the micro arrays by mapping into known functional pathways. The final result of this analysis will be a ""short list"" of candidate genes with potentially critical roles in infection-induced labor. In the second phase of the project, we analyze human tissues (myometrium, placenta, chorion, amnion, decidua, amniocytes and blood) collected from approximately 1360 patients presenting in term and preterm labor in a cross-sectional case-control study matching for race. Expression analysis in these tissues will be targeted to the human homologues of the enriched list of candidate critical genes identified in the mouse. Differential gene expression in pre term labor with or without infection and premature rupture membranes, as well as among different racial groups, will be characterized. A computational tool known as a support vector machine will be used to generate a rank order list predictive of preterm delivery, taking into account historical, clinical and laboratory variables. This tool will identify the subset(s) of genes most likely to form the genetic basis of preterm labor, and may provide a diagnostic molecular profiling instrument for predicting preterm delivery.

"GenePattern: Methodologies and Software Tools.  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years there have been exciting breakthroughs in the application of computational methods to problems in cancer genomics. Machine learning techniques applied to gene expression data have been used to address the questions of distinguishing tumor morphology, predicting post-treatment outcome, and finding molecular markers for disease. While these studies have been very promising, significant challenges remain. Extracting biological knowledge from microarray-based gene expression data is difficult. The development of robust and accurate expression-based classifiers of biological and clinical states is similarly problematic. Biologists do not have access to an integrated set of robust, sophisticated analytical tools.  Our goal is to develop, implement, and distribute computational genomics methods that address these challenges in the gene expression profiling field.  Aim 1: Capture the behavior of a set of genes representing a pathway or state of the cell to reduce a list of thousands of expressed genes into a few hundred metagenes. Metagenes should filter the noise, technical variation, and idiosyncrasies of the data, and capture the actual molecular logic or relevant biological correlations and structure in the data.  Aim 2: Develop a robust and validated computational methodology for using metagene markers for classification.  Aim 3: Develop and distribute an integrated software package, GenePattern, to put the power of sophisticated computational methods into the hands of the biomedical research community.  Our extensive experience developing methods, analyzing patient sample data, and creating and distributing software tools for this area of research makes us well suited to carry out this program. n/a",GenePattern: Methodologies and Software Tools.,6548915,R33CA097556,"['analytical method', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' form /pattern perception', ' functional /structural genomics', ' gene expression', ' genetic library', ' genetic screening', ' mathematical model', ' method development', ' microarray technology', ' molecular shape', ' phenotype', ' technology /technique development']",NCI,WHITEHEAD INSTITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL RES,R33,2002,738248,0.054013002405485525
"FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE DEVELOPING CEREBELLUM   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Granule cell precursors of the cerebellum        undergo exuberant proliferation and subsequent differentiation during postnatal      days 1-21 (Pl-21) in the mouse. Granule cells are also thought, to give rise to      medulloblastoma, a brain tumor primarily affecting children. This proposal is        aimed at characterizing gene expression profiles during the highly                   proliferative phase of cerebellar development in the postnatal mouse. Existing       analytical methods for elucidating the functional relationships between genes        expressed in cells typically fall to account for significant sources of              variation (i.e., ""noise"") inherent in the data. This problem will only be            compounded as analysis progresses from unicellular organisms to complex tissues      such as the developing CNS. The hypothesis driving the proposed research plan        is that improved classification and clustering techniques in functional              genomics can be obtained by incorporating sources of variation/noise into the        analytic method. The proposed work will utilize a model system of the                developing mouse cerebellum, from which improved methods for the interpretation      of complex, DNA microarray-based gene expression data will be developed.                                                                                                  Aim 1 is to generate a gene expression data set (consisting of the analysis of       19,000 genes) from the newborn and neonatal mouse cerebellum at various              developmental stages (P1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 18, 21, 30). Math-1 is a basic               helix-loop-helix transcription factor with essential roles in cerebellar             granule cell development. We will utilize transgenic mice in which selectable        reporter genes (e.g., jellyfish green fluorescent protein, GFP) are expressed        under control of the granule precursor cell-specific Math-1 enhancer. This will      allow for further subdivision into proliferating, immature granule cell              (Math-1-positive) and other cell types (Math-1-negative) by fluorescent cell         activated sorting (FACS). Aim 2- The time series obtained in Aim 1 will be           analyzed in both the time and frequency domain, using Fourier transforms of the      expression data. Classification and clustering techniques that fully exploit         the ""noise models"" developed in Aim 1 will be applied to these time series. In       Aim 3 we will screen candidate genes/ESTs to confirm appropriate                     spatio-temporal-specific expression in developing cerebellar granule cells from      P0-P21 using a high throughput in situ hybridization protocol. Deliverables          from the work include an open source, public domain, web-accessible tool kit of      noise-aware machine learning (classification and clustering) tools that are          anticipated to be widely applicable to the analysis of time series of gene           expression networks in complex biological systems. In addition, it is                anticipated that candidate genes with possible roles in cerebellar granule cell      proliferation, differentiation or possibly, tumorigenesis, will emerge that can      be analyzed in future hypothesis-driven projects.                                                                                                                         n/a",FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE DEVELOPING CEREBELLUM,6394443,R21NS041764,"['artificial intelligence', ' cerebellum', ' developmental genetics', ' developmental neurobiology', ' flow cytometry', ' functional /structural genomics', ' genetically modified animals', ' granule cell', ' green fluorescent proteins', ' in situ hybridization', ' laboratory mouse', ' neurogenetics', ' reporter genes']",NINDS,DANA-FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE,R21,2001,229539,0.023379174131928162

"INTELLIGENT MAPPING OF GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES As a step toward understanding the complex differences between normal and cancer cells, much research has been devoted to analyses of genes that are differentially expressed in particular cells.  Though recent technological advances have made it possible to conduct serial and/or simultaneous analysis of the expression patterns of thousands of genes, no comprehensive study has been reported on how many genes are expressed differentially and whether most differences are cell line-specific.  The long- term goal of this research is to develop intelligent data mapping and visual explanation technologies to improve information exploration and interpretation from high-throughput gene expression profiles for molecular analysis of cancer. Suggested by preliminary evidence from mRNA profiles of breast/prostate cancer cells that transcriptome patterns are rich in information about mechanisms that underlie cancer development, in the R21 research, multidisciplinary knowledge of molecular biology and computational intelligence are applied to (1) design cost effective molecular experiments to establish gene transcriptome distributions across cell lines, (2) pilot test the existence of transcriptome clusters in the molecular species space that correlate to cell phenotypes, and (3) identify key biomarkers that differentiate different cell lines with the highest prediction values.  Since new knowledge can only be further acquired by exploring all of the interesting aspects of complex transcriptome data in high-dimensional space, in this R33 application a statistically principled hierarchical visual exploration technique is proposed to effectively reveal and interpret the intrinsic but hidden characteristics of transcriptome clusters that should better define the nature of cancer biology and therapeutic targets.  A novel integration of information theory and computer graphics will permit (1) an automatic identification and modeling of biomarker clusters, (2) a probabilistic component analysis to form hierarchical visualization spaces allowing the complete data set to be analyzed at the top level with best separated sub-clusters analyzed at deeper levels, and (3) an interactive intelligent interface for task/hypothesis driven data mining and decision making.  The innovative nature of the research relies on the concept of combining (1) a hybrid stepwise nonlinear discriminant analysis for biomarker identification and (2) a hierarchical visual exploration of multi-foci high-dimensional transcriptome distribution to interpret the complex relationships between molecular events and cell phenotypes.  n/a",INTELLIGENT MAPPING OF GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES,6504842,R33CA083231,"['breast neoplasms', ' computer simulation', ' estrogen inhibitor', ' gene expression', ' genetic mapping', ' genetic markers', ' genetic screening', ' genetic transcription', ' information display', ' information theory', ' mathematical model', ' messenger RNA', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' phenotype', ' prostate neoplasms', ' statistics /biometry', ' structural biology', ' technology /technique development', ' transcription factor']",NCI,CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF AMERICA,R33,2001,118872,0.010750946003408871

Evaluation of         the quality of data will be assessed through a combination of factors that           measure how well-known functional groupings are reflected in the output.             Efficiency and scalability will be measured through timed runs of MicroExplore       on a set of expression datasets of various sizes. Our study will focus on the        complex dataset of lymphoid gene expression belonging to an intramural NCI           laboratory. In the second phase, a novel hybrid approach will be designed to         utilize the results of multiple clustering algorithms and configurations to          achieve a ranked set of best overall clusters. Attempts to integrate external        data sources will add new dimensions to the analysis tool and provide for            powerful predictions.                                                                                                                                                     Improving the scientist's ability to accurately and efficiently identify which       candidate genes would make good therapeutics will be a fundamental step for          the advancement of cancer research and scientific discovery. MicroExplore will       be a valuable resource for the continuance of gene discovery and                     characterization. This platform will have strong potential for the enhancement       of clinical data analysis helping to characterize or profile the molecular           changes found in normal, precancerous and malignant tissue samples.                                                                                                       n/a",INNOVATIVE ALGORITHMS FOR MICROARRAY ANALYSIS,6070441,R21CA084739,"['artificial intelligence', ' gene expression', ' genetic mapping', ' information systems', ' mathematics', ' method development', ' microarray technology']",NCI,"SRA INTERNATIONAL, INC.",R21,2000,173501,0.031221527079632164

"CIPER--A NOVEL APOPTOSIS REGULATOR INVOLVED IN CANCER Dysfunction of apoptotic pathways plays a critical role in the development of cancer, and the identification and characterization of genes encoding regulators of apoptosis is therefore critical for understanding the pathophysiology of cancer and for developing novel therapeutic approaches. The laboratory has identified CIPER, a gene that regulates both apoptosis and the NF-kB signal transduction pathway, one which is associated with cell survival. Because of this dual function, CIPER appears to play an important role as the control point of a molecular decision-tree; under some circumstances, CIPER may promote apoptosis, while at other times CIPER may favor cell survival. Importantly, the CIPER gene has been found to be located at the chromosomal breakpoint region of t(1;14), a recurrent translocation associated with MALT B-cell lymphoma, and is frequently mutated in lymphomas of various other histologic types as well as some non-lymphoid neoplasms. Our hypothesis is that CIPER promotes tumor development through a combination of dysregulated apoptosis and NF-kB signaling which result from chromosomal mutations affecting the CIPER gene. We are proposing a series of aims to further define the molecular mechanisms by which CIPER controls these signaling pathways, to understand the cellular stimulae which influence CIPER function, and to explore how natural mutations in the CIPER gene affect its important role as a regulator of cell survival.  n/a",CIPER--A NOVEL APOPTOSIS REGULATOR INVOLVED IN CANCER,6208105,F32CA088470,"['B cell lymphoma', ' apoptosis', ' biological signal transduction', ' chromosome translocation', ' gene mutation', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' neoplastic transformation', ' nuclear factor kappa beta', ' phosphoproteins', ' regulatory gene', ' tissue /cell culture']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F32,2000,46300,-0.021867922703076692
"INTELLIGENT MAPPING OF GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES As a step toward understanding the complex differences between normal and cancer cells, much research has been devoted to analyses of genes that are differentially expressed in particular cells.  Though recent technological advances have made it possible to conduct serial and/or simultaneous analysis of the expression patterns of thousands of genes, no comprehensive study has been reported on how many genes are expressed differentially and whether most differences are cell line-specific.  The long- term goal of this research is to develop intelligent data mapping and visual explanation technologies to improve information exploration and interpretation from high-throughput gene expression profiles for molecular analysis of cancer. Suggested by preliminary evidence from mRNA profiles of breast/prostate cancer cells that transcriptome patterns are rich in information about mechanisms that underlie cancer development, in the R21 research, multidisciplinary knowledge of molecular biology and computational intelligence are applied to (1) design cost effective molecular experiments to establish gene transcriptome distributions across cell lines, (2) pilot test the existence of transcriptome clusters in the molecular species space that correlate to cell phenotypes, and (3) identify key biomarkers that differentiate different cell lines with the highest prediction values.  Since new knowledge can only be further acquired by exploring all of the interesting aspects of complex transcriptome data in high-dimensional space, in this R33 application a statistically principled hierarchical visual exploration technique is proposed to effectively reveal and interpret the intrinsic but hidden characteristics of transcriptome clusters that should better define the nature of cancer biology and therapeutic targets.  A novel integration of information theory and computer graphics will permit (1) an automatic identification and modeling of biomarker clusters, (2) a probabilistic component analysis to form hierarchical visualization spaces allowing the complete data set to be analyzed at the top level with best separated sub-clusters analyzed at deeper levels, and (3) an interactive intelligent interface for task/hypothesis driven data mining and decision making.  The innovative nature of the research relies on the concept of combining (1) a hybrid stepwise nonlinear discriminant analysis for biomarker identification and (2) a hierarchical visual exploration of multi-foci high-dimensional transcriptome distribution to interpret the complex relationships between molecular events and cell phenotypes.  n/a",INTELLIGENT MAPPING OF GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES,6174109,R21CA083231,"['breast neoplasms', ' computer simulation', ' estrogen inhibitor', ' gene expression', ' genetic mapping', ' genetic markers', ' genetic screening', ' genetic transcription', ' information display', ' information theory', ' mathematical model', ' messenger RNA', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' phenotype', ' prostate neoplasms', ' statistics /biometry', ' structural biology', ' technology /technique development', ' transcription factor']",NCI,CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF AMERICA,R21,2000,147648,0.010750946003408871

"Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics specifically and potently block the expression of disease-related genes. siRNA clinical utility is currently limited to disease targets in the liver, but the Khvorova lab has developed a novel, fully chemically modified siRNA platform that enables delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) and results in potent modulation of gene expression in mouse and monkey brain for 6 months. This technology provides an opportunity to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders, including Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Extensive chemical modification protects siRNAs from degradation and is essential for in vivo delivery, but lowers the gene silencing efficacy of many siRNA sequences. Bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to predict the activity of non-modified siRNAs, but these algorithms cannot predict whether a chemically modified siRNA will be functional. Identifying a hyperfunctional siRNA chemical modification pattern and developing a predictive algorithm for modified siRNA sequences will be critical for the widespread application of this platform in vivo to treat AD and other genetically-linked neurological disorders. The goal of this proposal is to identify parameters that impact the silencing efficacy of chemically modified siRNAs. Aim 1 will identify the step(s) that limit the activity of chemically modified siRNAs. Using a validated AGO2- immunoprecipitation technique and a small RNA high-throughput sequencing protocol, loading of 32 chemically modified siRNA sequences, each with 3 different chemical modification patterns, into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) will be quantified, and these results will be compared to their in vitro silencing activity. These efforts will provide a data set to determine the impacts of chemistry and sequence on the different steps of RISC function. Aim 2 will design and screen 192 siRNAs in 6 different chemical modification patterns (i.e., for a total of 1152 siRNAs) to systematically assess if and how changes to siRNA sequence and chemical modification patterns impact siRNA efficacy. These 1152 siRNAs will target 4 different mRNAs identified as therapeutic targets for AD. Completing this aim will identify siRNAs that effectively reduce the expression of AD targets. Using multiple bioinformatics analysis methods, including multi-parameter linear regression, support vector machine, and random forest, Aim 3 will model algorithms that specifically predict functional, chemically modified siRNAs. The best performing algorithm will be determined by independent and cross-validations. Completion of this project will decrease the extent of in vitro screening needed to identify functional chemically modified siRNAs capable of targeting disease genes in the CNS and streamline the design of siRNA therapies to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics are a promising class of drugs for the treatment of genetic disorders. Chemical modification of siRNA is necessary for delivery to the central nervous system, but may hinder the efficacy of some siRNAs. This project will define the relationships between siRNA sequence, chemical modification patterns, and efficacy to streamline the development of clinically-relevant siRNAs capable of treating genetically-defined neurological disorders.",Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders,9992249,F31LM013111,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hela Cells', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Huntington Disease', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA Degradation', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Interference Therapy', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA-Induced Silencing Complex', 'Seeds', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'random forest', 'screening', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic RNA', 'therapeutic target']",NLM,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,F31,2020,30514,-0.039451719261346545
"Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models Modern computational techniques based on machine-learning (ML) and, more recently, deep-learning (DL) are playing a critical role in realizing the precision medicine initiative. However, there is a critical need to systematically combine these powerful data-driven techniques with prior molecular network knowledge to make more accurate predictive models while also satisfactorily explaining their predictions in terms of mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. I propose to use domain specific knowledge from biology and computing to tackle three outstanding problems: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? ​Network-constrained Deep Learning for Metadata Imputation: ​​Most multifactorial phenotypes are tissue dependent and manifest differently depending on age, sex, and ethnicity. However, a majority of publicly-available genomic data lack these labels. I will develop a network-guided approach to predict missing metadata of samples based on their expression profiles by designing novel data-driven models where the model architecture and/or structure of the input data are constrained by an underlying gene network. ​Network-guided Functional Analysis of Genomic Data: ​​High-throughput experiments often generate lists of genes of interest that are hard to interpret. Functional enrichment analysis (FEA) is a powerful tool that attaches functional meaning to an experimental set of genes by summarizing them into sets of pathways/processes. However, standard FEA analysis is limited by incomplete knowledge of gene function, lack of context of the underlying gene network, and noise in expression data. I will address these limitations by developing a network-guided approach that jointly captures genes, their interactions, and their known biological pathways/processes into a common, low-dimensional space that facilitates deriving biological meaning by comparing the distance between the experimental gene set and the pathway/process of interest. ​Joint Multi-Species Genomic Data Analysis and Knowledge Transfer: ​​In particular, finding the optimal model system to use in a follow-up study based on genetic signatures derived from human experiments is challenging because genetic networks can be quite different from species to species. I propose to use data-driven models to embed heterogeneous networks comprised of human genes and model species genes into a common, low-dimensional space to better compare genetic signatures between two (or even multiple) species. I will apply these methods to three specific tasks, but I emphasize that the results of this study will be transferable to any other biological problem where complex gene/protein interactions are a major component. I have surrounded myself with a great support team and developed a strong professional development plan. The freedom and support provided by the F32 fellowship will be instrumental in achieving my goal of becoming a professor with an independent research group. This proposal aims to develop novel computational approaches that systematically combine prior molecular network knowledge, powerful data-driven computational techniques, and large transcriptome data collections to answer three critical questions in biomedicine: 1) how to predict missing labels associated with millions of publicly available samples? 2) what molecular/cellular function can be attached to these samples and 3) how can we translate the findings from human data to a model species and back? The core goal of my fellowship is to achieve this by infusing prior-knowledge into state-of-the-art data-driven statistical/machine learning methods so that we can overcome two major hurdles in studying complex, multifactorial traits and diseases: a) complex genetic interactions underlie multi-factorial traits and diseases, and b) these traits and diseases often differ in how they manifest from patient to patient.",Incorporating molecular network knowledge into predictive data-driven models,10022122,F32GM134595,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development Plans', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fellowship', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Freedom', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'base', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'driving force', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic association', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'human data', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical sciences', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'sex', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,67446,0.03045138465595152
"Systems Biology of Shape and Size Regulation Abstract The molecular regulation of body shape and size during development and regeneration involves numerous pathways precisely integrated together with the biophysical properties of cellular and tissue dynamics, a complex process poorly understood at the level of whole animals. The overall goal of this project is to gain a mechanistic understanding of the genetic regulation and coordination of large-scale tissue growth by developing and applying a novel integrated systems biology approach. Combining in vivo experiments and their morphological formalization with machine learning of mathematical biophysical models, we will discern the molecular mechanisms that control growth, shape, and size regulation. We will leverage the robustness of the planarian worm to address the molecular and physical mechanisms regulating their extraordinary homeostatic and regenerative capacity to grow, degrow, and regenerate their whole-body shapes and organs from almost any amputation and across one order of magnitude in sizes. This work will develop novel computational systems biology methods and integrate them with whole-body gene expression imaging and surgical and genetic manipulations assays to elucidate the molecular regulators of body shape and size. Morphological, genetic, and surgical data will be formalized with novel mathematical ontologies, which will serve as input to new machine learning methods able to infer mechanistic gene regulatory networks. The regulatory networks will be quantitatively modeled with a novel mathematical continuous approach for whole-body biophysical simulation, including tissue growth, adhesion molecules, and gene regulation. This computational framework combining machine learning with biophysical modeling will be able to discover the mechanisms of growth and shape regulation from large formalized experimental datasets. Novel genetic interactions will be discovered by the machine learning methodology, which predictions in terms of morphological and gene expression outcomes resulting from genetic and surgical manipulations will be validated at the bench via RNAi and in situ hybridization assays. Integrating machine learning, biophysical mathematical modeling, ontological formalizations, and in vivo surgical and molecular assays represents a comprehensive systems biology approach for elucidating the regulation of shape and size. This work will provide a mechanistic understanding of the diverse genetic pathways that regulate tissue growth dynamics and how they interact precisely between them and with tissue biophysics to create and maintain whole-body scale targeted shapes and sizes. This work will pave the way for new applications and novel therapies in human developmental, regenerative, and cancer medicine. Project Narrative The genetic regulation of the shape and size of internal organs and whole body is crucial during development, regeneration, and homeostasis.

"A next-generation morbid map of the human genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The impact of next-generation sequencing (NGS) on gene discovery and molecular diagnostics for Mendelian conditions (MCs) is hard to overstate. However, to provide affected individuals with precise natural history, recurrence risk, and prognosis in clinical settings, identification of pathogenic variant(s)/genotypes alone is often insufficient. This is a challenge most notably for genes that cause more than one MC or ~25% of all genes that underlie MCs. In such an instance, even with a known genotype a patient's phenotype has to be compared to that of all MCs caused by variants in a gene to determine which MC, if any, is the likely diagnosis or whether patient instead has a novel condition. This comparison is increasingly difficult because delineation of the ~5,100 MCs currently known has typically been based on subjective grouping of affected individuals by phenotypic similarity. We propose to develop a quantitative framework for assessing overlap among the distributions of phenotypes due to pathogenic genotypes the same gene and apply this framework genome-wide. NGS has enabled identification of causal genotypes in hundreds of thousands of individuals with MCs, providing a sufficiently large dataset that it is now feasible to use machine learning to quantitatively and systematically identify “clusters” of co-occurring genotypes and phenotypic features for each known gene. We will refine and validate our approach by comparing differences between conventionally-delineated and quantitatively-delineated MCs and by assessing the similarity of individuals with well-studied atypical phenotypes/genotypes to quantitatively-delineated MCs. We will then apply the optimal strategy across the genome to generate a “next- generation morbid map” based on quantitatively-delineated MCs. We will also apply machine learning approaches to identify genomic properties associated with the propensity for each gene to underlie multiple MCs (i.e., the numeric contribution of each gene to the morbid map or phenotropy). This will enable a more precise and complete understanding of the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of each MC, enable more objective diagnosis of individuals with atypical phenotypes, and more robustly identify the existence of multiple MCs among individuals with non-specific “class” phenotypes (e.g., developmental delay, autism, hearing impairment). We will make all newly developed methods publicly available via interactive and programmatic web-based tools to facilitate extension of this work to other human and model organism datasets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The major goals of this project are to develop a quantitative framework that enables objective delineation of Mendelian conditions, apply the framework to systematically delineate conditions across all genes known to underlie a Mendelian condition, and predict the number of conditions due to each gene. This framework will provide a fuller, unbiased characterization of the genotypic/phenotypic spectrum for all Mendelian conditions, enable more precise diagnoses and counseling of individuals with difficult to diagnose phenotypes, and accelerate the detection of new Mendelian conditions.",A next-generation morbid map of the human genome,10047366,R35HG011297,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Natural History', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'gene discovery', 'genome-wide', 'hearing impairment', 'large datasets', 'molecular diagnostics', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'web-based tool']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2020,466172,0.01225650156533058
"Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity Project Summary Our overarching goal is to understand how information characterizing genes and their function can be organized, integrated, and then generalized to new contexts. This is a central question of the post-genomic era, and one that becomes ever more pressing as novel assays expand the scope, breadth, and detail of information describing gene properties. While the Gene Ontology is the most prominent and universal system for organizing gene function, hundreds of others exist, often serving specialized research interests. Most laboratories depend on the validity of some subset of this data to design new experiments or interpret their results, but their quality is hard to directly ascertain, particularly in novel or complex integrative methodologies. Based on substantial preliminary data, we hypothesize that determining robustness and specificity will provide a highly general assessment of the utility of databases. We propose to use these properties to assess the entire corpus of resources organizing gene information, as well as the methods which exploit this information, and the results that they report. Critically, determining robustness and specificity does not require validation with respect to ‘gold standard’ information. By evaluating these resources with respect to their joint specificity and robustness we determine means of integrating and organizing their data for use in novel applications. Finally, we propose to apply our improvements in quality control to better target rare but robust results where this is an experimental goal, notably rare diseases and single cell expression. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Determine the uniqueness and robustness of data characterizing gene function. We develop a formal approach for characterizing robustness and uniqueness/specificity by exploiting prior probability in the form of gene multifunctionality. We will evaluate robustness and specificity across essentially all complex and structured databases characterizing genes. These measures can be compared between databases or over time and provide a global landscape of data structure. 2. Test methods designed to exploit information describing gene function. Statistical and machine learning methods exploiting structured data will be assessed for robust and specific output. Data features driving performance in diverse applications will be identified and complementary sources of data as well as community clusters will be defined. 3. Evaluate results that depended on the use of databases describing gene function. Using a combination of text-mining and figure-mining, we will assess the ongoing literature for novel, robust, and specific gene-function associations. We will characterize and evaluate the “dark matter” of gene-function association from both the point of unannotated genes as well as incomplete functions. Project Narrative Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene function in many different contexts and this data is captured in numerous resources which catalogue the varied properties of genes. The primary goal of this project is to explore and characterize the specificity and robustness of information about gene function within these databases. Because most biomedical experiments build on pre-existing knowledge, establishing guidelines for interpreting that data also has a large impact on our ability to understand novel results, particularly where they are unusual, as in many rare diseases.",Heuristics to evaluate biomedical and genomic knowledge bases for validity,9995573,R01LM012736,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Information Resources', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor', 'Modification', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'comparative', 'dark matter', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'database structure', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'statistical and machine learning', 'structured data', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2020,480000,0.04617169323927969
"Functional annotation of new genes aided by deep learning New genes (NGs) are generated by multiple mechanisms and their end-piece sequences are identified as the chimeric transcript sequence from multiple human sources including healthy and disease tissues. Therefore, NGs have been recognized as important biomarkers and therapeutic targets for precision medicine. Many efforts have been made to study individual NG function and to identify relevant drug targets. However, the current in-depth research and achievements are mainly concentrated on several driver NGs, and classical cancer drugs have been directly used to target the NG domains, such as the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 fusion protein in leukemia. Some of the fusion proteins with retaining DNA-binding domains such as transcription factors can directly bind their target genes, such as the EWSR1-FLI fusion actively recruiting BAF complex. Recently, the downstream effectors of driver FGs have emerged as therapeutic targets. For example, targeting the downstream CCND2 inhibited RUNX1/ETO-driven leukemic expansion in vitro and in vivo and inhibition of STAT5, the downstream factor of NUP214-ABL1 led to the induction of leukemia cell death. However, the functions of most identified FGs have not been systematically investigated. This is mainly due to the limitations of traditional tools and the high cost of experimental procedures. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new tools for analyzing NG breakpoint-specific features systemically in the human genome and predict their originating and regulatory mechanisms, such as upstream and downstream effectors. In-depth annotation based on NG structure is important for understanding the cellular mechanisms of NGs. Effective use of systematic bioinformatics tools for functional annotation can provide a deeper insight into the role of NGs in the development and progression of diseases such as cancers to find direct and indirect therapeutic targets. In this study, we will develop five bioinformatics tools for the functional annotation and feature analysis of NGs, a predictive pipeline for automatic analysis of downstream effects of NGs, and a predictive method for tracing the origin of NGs. This project will be a substantial contribution to public health by systematicallydeep annotating thefunction of new genes (NGs) in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. These systematic annotation results will be performed through ChimerAnno (a tool for functional annotation of human chimeric genes), FGviewer (a tool for visualizing multi-tiered functional features of fusion genes), NGeffector with DeepChIP (a tool for predicting NG downstream effectors with enhanced transcription factor binding site prediction with deep learning), DeepCLIP (a tool for providing evidence of origin of NGs for trans-splicing mechanism) and hBPAI (a tool for feature extraction of human new genes' breakpoint (BP)). The application of these approaches on all kinds of human BPs of new genes will be integrated into NewGeneDB, New Gene annotation Database. This study will advance our knowledge in NG regulatory mechanisms in diseases and open up the possibility of novel treatments of cancer tools and platforms for analyzing NGs. and other diseases in the future by providing powerful",Functional annotation of new genes aided by deep learning,10029297,R35GM138184,"['ABL1 gene', 'Achievement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Markers', 'CCND2 gene', 'Cell Death', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Complex', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'EWSR1 gene', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'NUP214 gene', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'RUNX1 gene', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Role', 'Source', 'Stat5 protein', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Splicing', 'Transcript', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer therapy', 'chimeric gene', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'feature extraction', 'fusion gene', 'gene function', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive tools', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R35,2020,334778,-0.015019165071024713
"Knowledge Management Center for Illuminating the Druggable Genome SUMMARY The understudied protein targets that are the focus of the implementation phase of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project need to be placed in the contexts of gene-sets/pathways, drugs/small-molecules, diseases/phenotypes, and cells/tissues. By extending our previous methods, we will impute knowledge about the understudied potential target protein kinases, GPCRs, and ion channels listed in the RFA using machine learning strategies. To establish this classification system, we will organize data from many omics- and literature- based resources into attribute tables where genes are the rows and their attributes are the columns. Examples of such attribute tables include gene or protein expression in cancer cell lines (CCLE) or human tissues (GTEx), changes in expression in response to drug perturbations or single-gene knockdowns (LINCS), regulation by transcription factors based on ChIP-seq data (ENCODE), and phenotypes in mice observed when single genes are knocked out (KOMP). In total, we will process and abstract data from over 100 resources. We will then predict target functions, target association with pathways, small-molecules/drugs that modulate the activity and expression of the target, and target relevance to human disease. To further validate such predictions, we will employ text mining to identify knowledge that corroborates with the data mining predictions, perform molecular docking of predicted small molecules using homology modeling, and seek associations between variants and human diseases by mining electronic medical records (EMR) together with genomic profiling of thousands of patients. In addition, we will develop innovative data visualization tools to allow users to interact with all the collected data, and develop social networking software to build communities centered around proteins/genes/targets as well as biological topics including pathways, cell types, drugs/small-molecules, and diseases. Overall, we will develop an invaluable resource that will accelerate target and drug discovery. NARRATIVE The Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project will facilitate translational research by integrating and mining data about understudied druggable targets from numerous repositories and other resources.

"Leveraging biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations to understand the genetic architecture of diseases and complex traits Project Summary  Over the past decade, data generated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to analyze heritability of human diseases and complex traits to improve understanding of genetic architecture, including identifying the genetic variants associated with diseases and their effect sizes. These heritability enrichment analyses have revealed underlying biological mechanisms such as regulatory elements involved in disease pathways. This research proposes statistical methods and analysis to formally assess the contribution of biological pathways, gene networks, and re-prioritized functional annotations to the genetic architecture of 94 human diseases and complex traits. Better understanding of disease architecture will improve genome-wide associations and fine mapping and provides robust inference of disease etiology and mechanisms.  The first aim is to determine the contribution of disease-associated gene pathways to disease heritability. It is well known that an abnormality in individual genes rarely causes a human disease. Large-scale pathway analysis will elucidate disease pathways by constructing functional annotations and applying an existing polygenic method to partition heritability. Furthermore, pathway analyses on candidate genes identified via whole-exome sequencing (WES) data will inform new biological inference. The resulting set of enriched pathway-trait pairs will further help with independent validation of previously reported associations and for novel associations enriched for trait heritability.  The second aim is to determine the contribution of gene network to disease heritability across 94 diseases, focusing on hub genes defined by a broad set of network connectivity metrics. The contribution of gene network to disease heritability has been only partially answered, limited to few network connectivity metrics across 42 diseases. Comprehensive analysis of gene sets informed by published gene networks will inform a new direction of integrating gene networks to infer biological mechanisms of human diseases. In addition, visualization method for large-scale gene networks will greatly enhance research translation, serving as a useful resource for studying gene-gene interactions for potential drugs and therapeutic targets.  The third aim is to de-noise and re-prioritize Mendelian annotations to infer candidate genes. Despite considerable process on prioritizing rare variants impacting Mendelian diseases, little is known about the utility of these Mendelian pathogenicity scores for common disease. I will conduct heritability enrichment analyses to answer informativeness of Mendelian disease pathogenicity scores for common disease. To further improve their informativeness, I propose a machine learning variant reprioritization framework. Ultimately, this project will produce (1) a detailed understanding of disease-associated biological pathways to disease heritability, (2) a set of functional annotations informed by gene networks significantly enriched for disease heritability, and (3) a new method to prioritize variants and identifying candidate genes based on diverse genomic features. Project Narrative Understanding human genetic variations, from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to mutations, offers a great potential in uncovering underlying disease mechanisms by identifying new disease-associated genes and in discovering potential drug targets and therapeutics. This proposed studies aim to understand the role of these genetic variations in trait heritability, leveraging disease-associated biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations. The developed method to prioritize variants and genes will answer the contribution of gene pathways, gene sets informed by gene networks, and Mendelian pathogenicity scores to disease heritability.","Leveraging biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations to understand the genetic architecture of diseases and complex traits",9990520,F31HG010818,"['Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Targeting', 'Etiology', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'base', 'denoising', 'disorder risk', 'exome sequencing', 'fitness', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'open source', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2020,45520,0.005763599655260646
"Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo. ABSTRACT: “Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo”  microRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small regulatory RNAs involved in repression of gene expression. They recognize their target mRNAs though base pairing and upon binding, trigger translational repression, deadenylation and decay of the target mRNAs. Given that each miRNA has the potential to regulate hundreds of genes, and several dozens of miRNAs are expressed in each cell type, miRNAs are one of the master regulators of gene expression at post-transcriptional level in animals, plants and virus. Thus, the elucidation of the miRNA complement is essential to understand gene regulation and mRNA turnover. The goal of this project is to develop a high-throughput method for miRNA discovery and experimental validation in vivo.  Current miRNA discovery methods heavily rely on providing sequencing evidence of a small RNA that fits into a hairpin-like structure predicted bioinformatically. The problem is that sample availability or the abundance of a specific cell type in a tissue may be limited and hamper the number of miRNAs that can be backed-up with sequencing support. In these situations, the current solution is to sequence deeper, increasing overall costs. On the other hand, the presence of a small RNA of ~22-nt does not guarantee the belonging to the miRNA family, as random degradation of cellular RNAs also will produce small RNAs of this size and only tedious experimental validation of their processing into intermediate species and mature miRNA can confirm their identity.  A recent curation work found that of the over ~7,000 metazoan miRNAs in miRBase, the reference miRNA database, only 1,175 fulfilled the features necessary to pass as miRNAs, directly rejected 3,470 as false positives and lacked enough sequencing evidence to call another 2,105 miRNAs. Therefore, there is an unmet technological need to develop a miRNA validation method that boosts the access to the miRNA candidates even from limited samples and that allows rigorous multiplexed experimental validation of their processing.  With the synergy of an interdisciplinary team that combines expertise in microRNAs and zebrafish manipulation (Dr. Cifuentes, PI) and bioinformatics (Dr. Moxon, co-I), we will develop miRAGe (miRNA Analysis Genome wide), a high-throughput method to integrate miRNA prediction and their experimental validation in vivo. The fundamental concept behind miRAGe is the use of living cells as “organic computers” to analyze miRNA processing. We will use massively parallel oligo pool synthesis to prepare the miRNA candidate precursors and test their processing in injected zebrafish embryos. Small RNA sequencing will determine which candidates are true microRNA by detecting their ~22-nucleotide mature product and their stereotypic intermediates.  Overall, the results from this project will transform the access of the scientific community to high quality, experimentally validated miRNA data from any organism with genomic data available, thus enhancing future transversal studies on post-transcriptional regulation. NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a high-throughput method to integrate microRNA prediction and their experimental validation in vivo. We will take advantage of oligo pool synthesis to prepare the microRNA candidate precursors and test their processing after injection in zebrafish embryos.

"Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity Cortical GABAergic interneurons are critical components of neural circuitry, and their dysfunction has been linked to neurodevelopmental diseases. Although the diversity of interneurons is not disputed, both the extent of their heterogeneity and the gene regulatory mechanisms that drive it remain unclear. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing technology have shed new light on this issue, enabling the prediction of novel interneuron subtypes based on gene expression. Cross-species meta-analysis would provide key insight into conserved mechanisms of interneuron diversity. However, cross-study integration remains a major challenge. I hypothesize that interneuron identity is defined by unifying molecular processes across species. This project is designed to reveal these processes by using an integrative, cross-species approach to explore the transcriptional, epigenetic, and developmental mechanisms that govern interneuron diversity. First, I have shown that mouse interneuron subtypes replicably express genes associated with cell-cell communication, enabling cross-dataset meta-analysis. The goal of Aim 1 is to use improved computational and phylogenetic methods to define homologous interneuron subtypes across species and identify robust gene targets. Second, preliminary investigation of single cell methylome-sequencing data indicates that it can be readily aligned with expression data. In Aim 2 I will use machine learning methods to generate networks from epigenomic and expression data and identify subtype-specific regulatory features. Third, I have shown that transcriptional profiles from developing neurons can be quantitatively assessed with respect to adult expression data. Aim 3 will use meta-analytic aggregation of temporal inference methods to enable cross-dataset comparisons and define conserved developmental gene programs. These studies will reveal a multidimensional portrait of interneuron molecular identity and enable genetic access to these cell types, a key aim of the BRAIN Initiative. I also propose an extensive training plan that will support my transition to independence. CSHL provides an outstanding research environment, with unequaled opportunities for scientific discussion, advanced skills training and career development. I have assembled an exceptional team of collaborators and mentors who will help me to achieve my goals. Dr. Jesse Gillis, expert in transcriptome meta-analysis, and Dr. Josh Huang, expert in GABAergic interneuron identity, will be my mentors. Dr. Bing Ren, Dr. Adam Siepel, Dr. Guoping Feng, Dr. Jessica Tollkuhn and Dr. Michael Greenberg will be collaborators and members of my advisory committee, ensuring that my research will be of the highest caliber. My training will also involve coursework in multiomics data integration and comparative genomics, and I will continue my professional development by presenting at international conferences, mentoring students and attending workshops at CSHL. Together, the proposed studies and professional training will ensure my successful transition to an independent position at a major university where I will lead a lab that will advance the goals of the BRAIN Initiative. Interneurons are key components of neural circuitry, acting as the cellular `brakes' that dampen neuronal activity. Although it has long been known that interneurons come in many different shapes and sizes, both the extent of this diversity and its consequences for brain function remain unclear. In this project, we propose that by combining information about the gene activity and epigenetic landscapes of interneurons across multiple species we will generate an integrated, multi-layered portrait of interneuron diversity which we can use to understand brain",Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity,9898481,K99MH120050,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Bar Codes', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Maintenance', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Lateral Geniculate Body', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Portraits', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'career development', 'cell type', 'comparative genomics', 'data integration', 'design', 'developmental neurobiology', 'differential expression', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'methylome', 'mouse genetics', 'neural circuit', 'neuroinformatics', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills training', 'student mentoring', 'symposium', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,K99,2020,118421,-0.0017113701841560065
"Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development Project Summary  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a life-threatening birth defect that accounts for 8% of all major congenital anomalies. In cases where CDH co-occurs with cardiovascular malformations (CVMs), mortality rates increase from 30 to 60%, and long-term morbidity is common. Our goal is to identify genes that cause CDH and CDH/CVM, and to discover the mechanism by which they control diaphragm and heart development.  Correctly identifying genes that contribute to specific phenotypes from the large list of candidate genes data generated in research and clinical studies is a major obstacle to progress in this and other research fields. In Specific Aim #1, we will address this challenge by generating ranked CDH and CDH/CVM pathogenicity scores for all RefSeq genes using a machine-learning algorithm that integrates data from large-scale genomic knowledge sources. We will use these scores to identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes from cytogenetically defined critical regions and form large next-generation sequencing databases as part of our multifaceted approach to novel gene discovery. We will also accelerate the pace at which human disease genes are discovered by making these scores and our machine-learning algorithm freely available.  8p23.1 microdeletions that encompass GATA4 and SOX7 are among the most frequently identified causes of CDH/CVM. In RNA-seq studies, we identified several CDH-associated genes that are dysregulated in the E15.5 diaphragms of Gata4flox/flox;Prx1-Cre embryos. These embryos are an ideal model of the sac hernias that comprise 20% of human CDH cases. In Specific Aim #2, we will combine data from RNA-seq and BioChIP-seq analyses with the priority scores generated in Aim #1 to identify primary GATA4 target genes whose dysregulation contribute to the development of sac CDH. We will then determine if alterations in the expression of these target genes can cause CDH, or can modify the CDH phenotypes of GATA4-deficient mice.  We have shown that SOX7 deficiency causes septal defects by decreasing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the developing heart. In RNA-seq and in situ hybridization studies we have shown that the expression of Wnt4—a key regulator of EMT in the endocardium—is severely decreased in E9.5 Sox7-/- hearts. In Specific Aim #3 we will determine if Wnt4 is a primary target of SOX7, and whether modulation of WNT4 or its downstream effectors can rescue SOX7-related cardiac phenotypes.  Several lines of evidence suggset that WNT4 is a novel CDH/CVM gene in humans. To confirm this association, and learn more about the role of WNT4 in diaphragm and heart development, we will determine if WNT4 deficiency causes CDH/CVM in mice, if Sox7 and Wnt4 interact genetically in the development of CDH/CVM and if SOX7 regulates Wnt4 transcripition in the developing diaphragm.  Through these studies we will identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes and pathways. The bioinformatic tools we develop in this grant will enhance gene discovery efforts across multiple research fields. Project Narrative Diaphragmatic hernias and cardiovascular malformations are serious birth defects.

"Addressing Open Challenges of Computational Genome Annotation We propose to capitalize on success of ongoing collaboration between the bioinformatics teams at the University of Greifswald (Germany) and at the Georgia Institute of Technology (USA) and address open challenges in computational genome annotation. In the course of this development, we plan to implement new algorithmic ideas and satisfy the needs of unbiased integration of different types of OMICS data.  We plan to address one of the long-standing problems at interface of bioinformatics and machine learning – automatic generative and discriminative parameterization of gene finding algorithms. Current methods of combining OMICS evidence frequently result in under predicting or over predicting tools. Having good understanding of the difficulties and the properties of different types of OMICS evidence we propose an optimized approach to the full unsupervised, generative and discriminative training.  We will introduce novel means to optimize integration of multiple OMICS evidence into gene prediction. These ideas will develop further the protein family-based gene finding implemented in AUGUSTUS-PPX. We propose to create representations of protein families for gene finding that for the first time include cross-species gene structure information.  We will develop a new approach that will unify two advanced research areas - transcript reconstruction from RNA-Seq and statistical gene finding that integrates RNA-Seq and homology information. We will describe a new, comprehensive model and EM-like algorithmic technique (the “wholistic” approach) to identify the sets of transcripts and their expression levels that best fit the available OMICS evidence.  We will also develop an automatic gene-finding algorithm for a full content of metagenomes including eukaryotic and viral metagenomic sequences. This task is conventionally considered too challenging. We propose a solution exploiting and advancing algorithmic ideas and approaches that we mastered in the course of creating gene finders for prokaryotic metagenomes as well as eukaryotic genomes.  All new tools will be available to the community under open source licenses. The goal of this project is to advance the science of genome interpretation by developing much needed computational methods and tools for high precision annotation of eukaryotic genomes and metagenomes. This advance will make an impact in research on model and non-model organisms including important human pathogens, parasites and viruses. New high throughput technologies generate volumes of sequence data on complex genomes as well as metagenomes. Still these big data volumes have to be transformed into scientific knowledge. Our new bioinformatics tools, matching the latest sequencing technology in speed and performance, will make a significant impact in genomic research aiming at ultimate understanding of human health and disease.",Addressing Open Challenges of Computational Genome Annotation,9975182,R01GM128145,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area', 'Bacteriophages', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Germany', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Insecta', 'Institutes', 'Introns', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nested Genes', 'Noise', 'Overlapping Genes', 'Parasites', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Running', 'Speed', 'Spliced Genes', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'course development', 'design', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'gene complementation', 'genome annotation', 'genome sciences', 'high throughput technology', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'instrument', 'member', 'metagenome', 'multiple omics', 'nanopore', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'predictive tools', 'protein profiling', 'reconstruction', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,342390,0.009693857491897748
"Repurpose open data to discover therapeutics for understudied diseases Project Summary/Abstract Many diseases are understudied because they are rare or of little public interest. The effect of each understudied disease may be limited, but the cumulative effects of all these diseases could be profound. One common research challenge for these diseases is that the resources allocated to each is often limited. For instance, large- scale screening of drugs is often challenging, if not possible, in small labs. The decreasing costs of next generation sequencing make possible the generation of gene expression profiles of understudied disease samples. Integrating these expression profiles with other open data provides tremendous opportunities to gain insights into disease mechanisms and identify new therapeutics for understudied diseases. We have utilized a systems-based approach that employs gene expression profiles of disease samples and drug-induced gene expression profiles from cancer cell lines to predict new therapeutic candidates for hepatocellular carcinoma, Ewing sarcoma and basal cell carcinoma. All these candidates were successfully validated in preclinical models. The success of this approach relies on multiscale procedures, such as quality control of disease samples, selection of appropriate reference tissues, evaluation of disease signatures, and weighting cell lines. There is a plethora of relevant datasets and analysis modules that are publicly available, yet are isolated in distinct silos, making it tedious to implement this approach in translational research. A centralized informatics system that allows prediction of therapeutics for further experimental validation is thus of great interest to researchers working on understudied diseases. Accordingly, we propose four specific aims: 1) developing novel deep learning methods to select precise reference normal tissues for disease signature creation, 2) developing computational methods to reuse drug profiles from other disease models for drug prediction, 3) integrating open efficacy data to identify new targets from the systems-based approach, and 4) developing a centralized platform and promoting the platform in the scientific community. This proposal will reuse several big open databases (e.g., TCGA, TARGET, GTEx, GEO, LINCS, CTRP, GDSC) and employ cutting-edge informatics methods (e.g., deep learning). To demonstrate the scalability of the system, we will investigate three representative understudied diseases: multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (Aim 1), diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (Aim 2) and hepatocellular carcinoma (Aim 3). Successful implementation of the systems-based approach can be used as a model for using other large open omics (proteins, metabolites) to discover therapeutics for diseases with unmet needs. This proposal will bring together experts in informatics, statistics, computer science, and physicians from Michigan State University, Stanford University, UC Berkeley and Spectrum Health. All data and code will be released to the public for continuing development. The system will be deployed to our OCTAD portal (http://octad.org), an open workplace for therapeutic discovery. Project Narrative About 25 million people are living with understudied diseases in the U.S. Although there are voluminous high dimensional molecular datasets that could be leveraged for research, individual labs have limited computational capacity to translate these molecular features into therapeutic hits. We propose to build a centralized information system that allows individual labs to easily harness open gene expression datasets and generate new therapeutic targets or drug candidates for further experimental validation.",Repurpose open data to discover therapeutics for understudied diseases,9998976,R01GM134307,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Asia', 'Basal Cell', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Cancer cell line', 'Case Study', 'Cell Line', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Modelings', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Evaluation', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Quality Control', 'Ramp', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'System', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Workplace', 'base', 'cancer gene expression', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'disorder control', 'drug candidate', 'drug mechanism', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open data', 'overexpression', 'pill', 'protein metabolite', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,413916,0.031307866087414
"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9928344,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Pan Genus', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'dark matter', 'drug development', 'fly', 'genetic association', 'genome annotation', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mitochondrial genome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peptide hormone', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'screening', 'terabyte']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2020,1186500,0.001926249469641249
"Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation PROJECT SUMMARY  Studies are proposed to dissect one of the fundamental, binary development decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. The nematode C. elegans determines sex with remarkable precision by tallying X- chromosome number relative to the sets of autosomes (X:A signal): ratios of 1X:2A (0.5) and 2X:3A (0.67) signal male fate, while ratios of 3X:4A (0.75) and 2X:2A (1.0) signal hermaphrodite fate. We have discovered much about the nature and action of the X:A signal and its direct target, a master sex-determination-switch gene that also controls X-chromosome dosage compensation. However, a fundamental question remains: how is the signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? We pioneer new methods using machine learning neural networks to address this question with single-molecule and single-cell resolution. We also propose to dissect the functional interplay between chromatin modification and chromosome structure in regulating gene expression over vast chromosomal territories. X-chromosome dosage compensation in C. elegans is exemplary for this analysis: we found recently that dosage-compensated X chromosomes have (i) elevated levels of modified histone H4K20me1 compared to autosomes and (ii) a unique three-dimensional architecture. Both are imposed by the dosage compensation complex (DCC). Loss of H4K20me1 disrupts 3D architecture and elevates X gene expression. In the nematode DCC, one subunit is an H4K20me2 demethylase and five subunits are homologs of condensin subunits, which compact and resolve mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. All DCC subunits are recruited specifically to hermaphrodite X chromosomes by an XX-specific subunit that triggers binding to cis- acting regulatory elements on X (rex) to reduce gene expression by half. The DCC remodels the structure of X into topologically associating domains (TADs) using its highest affinity rex sites to establish domain boundaries. Despite this knowledge, important questions underlying the mechanisms of dosage compensation remain. What DCC subunits recognize the X-enriched motifs in rex sites to bind X directly? How does the DCC regulate RNA polymerase II to repress gene expression? What mechanisms underlie H4K20me1's control of chromosome structure, and how does DCC-mediated higher-order structure affect gene expression? Our findings should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state. Lastly, we will exploit our unexpected finding that rex sites have diverged across Caenorhabditis species separated by 30 MYR, retaining no functional overlap despite strong conservation of the core DCC machinery. This divergence provides an unusual opportunity to study the path for a concerted co- evolutionary change in hundreds of target sites across X chromosomes and the protein complexes that bind them. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our work dissects one of the fundamental, binary developmental decisions that most metazoans make: their sex. While we have discovered detailed molecular mechanisms about the nature and action of the signal that determines sex in the nematode C. elegans and its direct target, a critical question remains that we address: how is the sex signal interpreted reproducibly in an ""all or none"" manner to elicit fertile male or hermaphrodite development, never intersexual development? Our work also explores the functional interplay between chromosome structure, chromatin modification, and long-distance regulation of gene expression by studying X- chromosome dosage compensation. The nematode dosage compensation complex, a condensin complex, equalizes X-chromosome gene expression between the sexes by imposing a unique three-dimensional architecture onto hermaphrodite X chromosomes and by catalyzing enrichment of the modified histone H4K20me1 through a subunit that is a H4K20me2 histone demethylase. Results from exploring the connection between higher-order chromosome structure and chromatin modification should have broad implications, because (i) condensin complexes control chromosome structure from bacteria to man, (ii) H4K20me1 is enriched on the inactive X of female mammals, (iii) demethylases are linked to tumor progression, and (iv) the H4K20me2 demethylase modulates nematode growth, metabolism, and entry into the quiescent dauer state.",Analysis of Nematode Sex Determination and Dosage Compensation,9898392,R35GM131845,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Caenorhabditis', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosome Territory', 'Chromosomes', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Dosage Compensation (Genetics)', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth', 'Hermaphroditism', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Histones', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Meiosis', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mitotic', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Nematoda', 'RNA Polymerase II', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Switch Genes', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'X Inactivation', 'autosome', 'chromatin modification', 'condensin', 'dosage', 'histone demethylase', 'male', 'man', 'neural network', 'protein complex', 'recruit', 'sex', 'sex determination', 'single molecule', 'tumor progression']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R35,2020,466290,0.020294956401429816
"Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome Project Summary/Abstract Kinases are among the most important drug targets and clinically significant kinase inhibitors have been developed for multiple diseases. A subset of kinases, the understudied dark kinases (DKs), have received little or no attention because foundational data on their biochemical and biological functions is not available. This proposal will collect such data by perturbing DKs genetically and with small molecules and then measuring the cellular consequences using multiplex proteomic, gene expression, metabolomic and imaging assays. A subset of DKs with potential links to human disease will be intensively studied as a means to qualify new therapeutic drug targets. Data collected in this project will be aggregated with existing information from previous NIH-funded large-scale structural and genomic projects to create a Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK) that provides gene-by-gene and network-level information on the dark kinome and its interaction with other signal transduction and regulatory networks. Close coordination with the NIH LINCS project will ensure data interoperability and make efficient use of informatics tools. The DKK will be developed in collaboration with the IDG Knowledge Management Center (KMC), adhere to standards for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data, and be accessible to human users and machines (via an API). Commercially available DK reagents be validated and extended with new genetic and chemical tools provided to the Resource Dissemination Center (RDOC). The overall approach will be iterative, with simpler methods applied first (e.g. simple gene knockout) and more sophisticated methods subsequently (e.g. stable CRIPSRa/i) pursued by an interdisciplinary team of chemists, computational biologists, mass spectroscopists and pharmacologists working on five linked aims. Aim 1 will develop a computational algorithm for prioritizing DKs, develop and maintain the DKK, and perform network-level analysis on the kinome using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Aim 2 will measure kinase abundance in normal and perturbed cells using parallel reaction monitoring with stable isotope dilution (PRM-SID) and RNASeq and data analyzed using network inference tools to provide insight into dark and light kinome in diverse cell types. Aim 3 will perturb DKs with genetic tools such as CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, CRIPSRa/i to induce more subtle-up and down regulation and inducible gene inaction. The impact on cell fate, morphology and signal transduction will then be determined using PRM-SID, phosphoproteomics, RNASeq, gene reporter assays, metabolomics profiling and highly multiplex single-cell imaging. Aim 4 will extend DK analysis to small molecule inhibitors by carefully profiling existing drugs against DKs and by designing and synthesizing new chemical ligands. Aim 5 will involve collaboration with other investigators to assay the expression and function of DKs in primary human cells and tissues relevant to the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. All aims will be pursued in parallel for a progressively expanding resource of data and tools for continued study of DKs. Project Narrative/Health Relevance Advancing understanding of understudied kinases, a highly druggable class of proteins, will increase knowledge about signal transduction and control over cellular physiology and is likely to reveal a subset of proteins that should be advanced as targets for new therapeutic drugs.",Illuminating Function of the Understudied Druggable Kinome,10015261,U24DK116204,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Arthritis', 'Attention', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Information Resources Management', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'data interoperability', 'data resource', 'data reuse', 'data tools', 'design', 'human disease', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knockout gene', 'knowledge base', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phosphoproteomics', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stable isotope', 'structural genomics', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'unsupervised learning']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2020,2259159,0.020283881631169128
"Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models Many chronic diseases are complex and very heterogeneous. They can be affected by multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors, and patients of one disease can be divided into subgroups, e.g., cancer subtypes or stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). One can use the genome-wide gene expression data to investigate these disease's molecular signatures, which may help understand disease etiology and guide precise treatments. Graphical models are powerful tools to estimate complex network interactions among a large number of genes. To develop biostatistical and machine learning methods to estimate such directed graphical models using gene expression data is the primary goal of this project. To this end, this project contains the following research activities: (1) Given known disease subtypes, Aim 1 develops novel techniques to jointly estimate multiple undirected/directed graphical models with one model per subtype. (2) In Aim 2, we consider the situation where disease subtypes are not defined a prior. We propose to identify disease subtypes by gene expression clustering, and the uncertainty of clustering is incorporated into the estimation of multiple directed graphical models in Aim 1. (3) Recent single cell RNAsequencing technology enables researchers to profile multiple cells from the same patient. Aim 3 focuses on estimating multiple directed graphical models (e.g., for multiple subclones of tumor cells, or multiple types of brain cells) using single cell RNA-seq data of one patient. The effectiveness of the proposed graphical model estimation methods will be demonstrated using cancer and AD data analysis. The research results have great potential to offer new insights on the understanding and precise treatments of these diseases. Furthermore, these methods are general enough to be applied to analyze omic data of other diseases as well. The research team will disseminate computational efficient and user-friendly software packages, research publications, academic presentations and collaborations with experts in cancer research and neurological diseases. The research to be carried out in this project will provide biomedical researchers with new tools to build graphical models that can be used to analyze big and complex omic data. These tools can be used to prioritize drug targets or to assess the consequence of drug with particular molecular targets, and thus are of great value for the research and practice of precision medicine.",Unlocking complex co-expression network using graphical models,9979887,R01GM126550,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Skeleton', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell type', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'interest', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'research and development', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'statistics', 'technique development', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,400001,0.02814329912831939
"Predicting gene regulation across populations to understand mechanisms underlying complex traits Project Summary Deeper understanding of the degree of transferability of genetic association results and implicated biological mechanisms across populations is essential for equitable precision medicine implementation and can only be accomplished by studying the genetic architecture of complex traits in diverse populations. In our initial project period, we have shown that genetic correlation of gene expression depends on shared ancestry proportions in African American, Hispanic, and European populations. We identified a subset of genes that are well-predicted in one population, but poorly predicted in another and showed these differences are due to allele frequency differences between populations. Our results demonstrate that when comparing predicted expression levels to the observed, a balance of the training population with ancestry similar to the test population and total sample size leads to optimal predicted gene expression. Our studies of lipid traits in Yoruba, Filipino and Hispanic populations uncovered key genes likely regulated by variants that are monomorphic or rare in European populations, demonstrating why studies in diverse populations are crucial. We have optimized genetic prediction models of gene expression levels in diverse populations and thus have broadened the scope of PrediXcan. In this proposal, we seek to (1) optimize global and local ancestry-aware omics trait prediction models within and across diverse populations and (2) predict the intermediate omics traits and perform poly- omic PrediXcan analyses of complex traits in GWAS cohorts from diverse populations. We have gathered data of multiple omics traits from diverse populations for this project (genome-wide genotype, RNA-Seq, methylomics, metabolomics, and microbiome). We will use machine learning to optimize genotypic prediction models of gene expression levels, splicing ratios, methylation, metabolite levels, and microbial diversity. We expect a range of predictive power will be observed across omics traits dependent on the heritability of each trait and differences in allele frequencies and effect sizes among populations. We will integrate regulatory data and previous results from larger European populations when appropriate to prioritize functional variants in our prediction models. For each omics trait, we will survey its genetic architecture to inform the best prediction models. Our models will account for global and local ancestry and we will quantify the ancestry specific components of each omics trait. We will test the predicted omics traits for association with phenotypes of interest using either raw genotypes or summary statistics. We will use colocalization methods to determine if the SNPs driving each omics trait prediction model are also those most associated with the phenotype and thus most likely to be causal. We will combine predicted omics traits in poly-omic models to determine which genes and biological pathways are implicated for a particular phenotype. Our team is well positioned to perform novel PrediXcan-based analyses of omics traits in diverse populations and promises to maximize impact by making our scripts, models, and results publicly available. Project Narrative Differences in DNA sequence among individuals can lead to differences in omics traits like gene expression, splicing, methylation, metabolite levels, and microbial diversity, which in turn can lead to trait differences. We have developed a method that harnesses DNA differences to predict omics traits, which are then tested for association with a disease or other trait of interest. Our project will lead to a better understanding of the degree of transferability of genetic association results across populations, which has the potential to improve the implementation of precision medicine among diverse populations and reduce health disparities.",Predicting gene regulation across populations to understand mechanisms underlying complex traits,9880471,R15HG009569,"['Adopted', 'African American', 'Authorship', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Balance training', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Catalogs', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Disease', 'European', 'Filipino', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Publishing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Variant', 'base', 'cohort', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'epidemiological model', 'epigenomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'interest', 'metabolomics', 'methylomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'statistics', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'undergraduate student']",NHGRI,LOYOLA UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R15,2020,436000,0.00882420647349472
"Genetic Predisposition To Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms/Dissections Thoracic aortic aneurysms leading to acute aortic dissections (TAAD) are a cause of premature deaths, responsible for up to 8% of sudden deaths in industrialized countries. Identifying individuals at risk for TAAD allows for medical management that prevents deaths due to dissections. We determined that up to 20% of TAAD patients without a known genetic syndrome have a family history of TAAD, which is inherited primarily in an autosomal dominant manner (termed heritable thoracic aortic disease, HTAD). We established a cohort of HTAD families (842 families with two or more members with TAAD) and used this cohort to identify novel HTAD genes. Positional cloning and candidate gene approaches by our lab and others have successfully identified 18 genes for HTAD. We hypothesize that there are multiple altered genes yet to be identified, disrupting known and novel molecular pathways responsible for thoracic aortic disease, and responsible for disease in the unsolved HTAD families. The overarching goal of the project is to identify the remaining genes for HTAD, characterize the phenotype associated with these novel genes, perform initial molecular studies linking the mutant gene to aortic disease, and rapidly translate these findings into improved clinical care and prevention of premature deaths due to aortic dissection in HTAD families. The proposed aims are: (1) Recruit and characterize additional HTAD families to be used to identify novel genes, and delineate the clinical features and mutation spectrum associated with new genes; (2) Pursue exome/genome sequencing on HTAD cases and use the genetic strategies to identify novel genes, including segregation of rare variants in affected relatives and trios (affected proband and unaffected parents) and burden analyses; (3) Pursue a machine-learning approach using exome data from HTAD families and controls to identify novel disease genes; (4) Perform initial molecular and cellular biology studies of novel HTAD genes to confirm a link between the mutant gene and thoracic aortic disease. In summary, we are uniquely poised to identify novel HTAD genes using our assembled cohort and are proposing both proven and novel strategies to identify additional HTAD genes. Uncovering HTAD genes is crucial for identifying individuals at risk for aortic dissections and initiating gene-specific clinical management to prevent premature death due to dissections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute aortic dissections are a common cause of premature death in the United States. The goal of the proposed research is to prevent premature deaths due to dissections by identifying individuals who are predisposed by uncovering all the genetic variants in the human genome that trigger dissection.",Genetic Predisposition To Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms/Dissections,10053081,R01HL109942,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Aorta', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Survival', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dissection', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'FBN1', 'FOXE3 gene', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'LOX gene', 'LTBP2 gene', 'Link', 'MADH4 gene', 'MYH11 gene', 'MYLK gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Marfan Syndrome', 'Medical', 'Molecular', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Sudden Death', 'Surgical Management', 'Syndrome', 'TGFB2 gene', 'TGFBR1 gene', 'TGFBR2 gene', 'Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'family management', 'gene discovery', 'genetic approach', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'positional cloning', 'premature', 'prevent', 'proband', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'segregation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2020,653552,-0.0025028206231625925
"Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development Rotator cuff tears affect over 15% of Americans and impair shoulder joint biomechanics and function. Following repair of symptomatic tears, functional deficits frequently persist and re-tears are common, due to the complex anatomy and high functional demands on the rotator cuff tendons. Rotator cuff tendon tissue engineering research is focused on devices to improve immediate mechanical support to the repair and to stimulate early and rapid tendon regeneration rather than scarring and fibrosis, particularly for the supraspinatus tendon (SST), the most commonly torn tendon in the rotator cuff. Aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic both the highly aligned medial region of the SST, and bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the multi-axially aligned isotropic anterior region of the SST have been evaluated with promising results when seeded with adipose- derived stem cells (ASCs). However, progress in this area of rotator cuff tendon engineering and in other areas of tendon research is hindered by the lack of definitive markers for SST or for its regional heterogeneity, the lack of understanding to what extent ASCs are tenogenic and can assume the identity of tendon fibroblasts, the lack of specific markers for tendon fibroblast identity and tenogenic differentiation, and by a lack of markers for tendon maturation and response to mechanical loading in engineered tendon. Therefore, is it difficult to assess how successful current tendon tissue engineering approaches really are, or to predict how well tendon tissue engineered approaches will function in translation when autologous or allogeneic ASCs from diverse human populations are used to enhance rotator cuff repair via augmentation or interposition with engineered tendon devices. These studies will evaluate the epigenome (methylome), transcriptome, proteome, lipidome, metabolome and phenome (phenotype) of native human SST and donor-matched tissue engineered tendon produced from SST fibroblasts and ASCs. Bioinformatics approaches will be used to integrate the data to an integrated multiome, which will then be used with machine learning approaches to extract key causal ‘driver’ genes, or tendon specific genes or molecules responsible for: 1) SST heterogeneity between medial and anterior regions. 2) Tendon cell identity and the extent of tenogenesis by ASCs on electrospun scaffolds. 3) The heterogenetic response by ASCs on uni- vs. bi-axially aligned electrospun scaffolds that mimic the native heterogeneity of the SST. 4) The response of engineered tendon to dynamic loading. Identified driver genes or molecules will be validated though over-expression or silencing approaches, thus providing therapeutic targets for manipulation to enhance tenogenesis, and engineered tendon development and maturation. Together these innovative studies will provide a template for improved external validity of benchtop tendon tissue engineering and pre-clinical studies towards successful translation in diverse patient populations. In addition, the bioinformatics and multiomics toolboxes and assays that result from this work will be invaluable to not only the tendon research community, but also to the wider musculoskeletal and regenerative medicine fields. A small number of driver genes in other medical fields are responsible for changes in expression and protein levels in hundreds of other genes, and subsequent tissue metabolism. The process of tissue engineered rotator cuff tendon development and formation as it relates to adult tendon after surgical repair is not well understood, despite rotator cuff tears being an important clinical problem and representing almost one third of orthopedic injuries. Evaluating changes in the ability of genes to be translated to proteins at the DNA, RNA, small metabolite, and protein level of tissue engineered tendon formation under different loading conditions compared to normal adult tendon will identify driver genes and potential new ways to improve currently available options for rotator cuff repair.",Driver Genes for Engineered Rotator Cuff Development,9894766,R01AR073882,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Allogenic', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biochemical', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Cadaver', 'Cells', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Engineered Gene', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Harvest', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Joint structure of shoulder region', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stimulation', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Natural regeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rotator Cuff', 'Seeds', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'design', 'epigenome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mechanical load', 'mechanical properties', 'metabolome', 'methylome', 'multiple omics', 'overexpression', 'patient population', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preclinical study', 'progenitor', 'regenerative', 'repaired', 'response', 'rotator cuff tear', 'scaffold', 'spatial relationship', 'stem cells', 'supraspinatus muscle', 'tendon development', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'translation to humans']",NIAMS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,491199,0.019683307629748664
"The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes PROJECT SUMMARY - HGNC The core objective of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) is to enable effective communication and data exchange between everyone with an interest in human genes, by providing a unique, concise and standardized gene symbol and name for every human gene. As usage of genomic data increases in healthcare the need for a consistent language for genes becomes ever more vital. Aim 1 of this proposal will ensure the continuity of standardized naming of novel human protein-coding genes, long and small non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and pseudogenes. In particular all putative novel protein coding loci will require careful consideration; as active members of the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) consortium, HGNC can ensure that named loci accurately reflect the current expert manual annotations provided by consortium members. Aim 2 concentrates on renaming newly characterized human genes that are currently assigned a placeholder symbol; some genes with a phenotype-based nomenclature will also be considered for reassignment. These updates will reflect functional information, aid name transferal to orthologous genes, and avoid confusion. This round of revision will be a precursor to a nomenclature freeze for the majority of protein coding genes. Aim 3 focusses on coordinating gene naming across vertebrates, collaborating with the six existing vertebrate gene nomenclature committees (mouse, rat, chicken, Anolis, Xenopus, zebrafish) which base their naming on human gene nomenclature. As the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) this effort will be extended to naming genes in vertebrates lacking a nomenclature authority, such as cow, dog and horse. Recent gene naming in chimpanzee enabled creation of the necessary tools, pipelines and databases required for naming in other species. Assignments will reflect homologous relationships to human genes. Aim 4 will investigate the utility of machine learning in automated assignment of systematic nomenclature to long ncRNA genes and vertebrate orthologs, and potentially to pseudogenes. Models will be trained on manually curated datasets to learn both explicit and implicit practices, and then applied at scale. Aim 5 will ensure consistent naming across vertebrates in complex and divergent gene families, which can reveal some of the most interesting evolutionary biology and account for key diversity between species, but require careful manual curation. HGNC will collaborate with experts to expand the successful gene naming in the pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 (CYP) family to further species, also working across species on two other complex key families involved in detoxification, the glutathione S-transferases (GST) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). HGNC will also work with experts to expand gene naming of olfactory receptors, the largest vertebrate gene family, from mammals to other well- studied model organisms such as zebrafish, Xenopus and chicken. HGNC is the only group worldwide providing systematic and user-friendly names for genes that are used throughout biomedical science and clinical practice; this is a crucial facility, with increasing importance and direct benefits for public health. To ensure effective communication between basic and clinical researchers, practicing clinicians and patients, there has to be a consistent well managed set of names for all human genes, which HGNC has provided since 1979. Having these names enables new discoveries, avoids confusion and prevents patient harm, by helping to ensure that everyone refers to a given gene using the same name.",The Nomenclature of Human and Vertebrate Genes,9937764,U24HG003345,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cattle', 'Chickens', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ensure', 'Equus caballus', 'Family', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Glucuronosyltransferase', 'Glutathione S-Transferase', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Nomenclature', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pan Genus', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudogenes', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Study models', 'Syntenic Conservation', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'Zebrafish', 'authority', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'gene product', 'genomic data', 'human genomics', 'interest', 'member', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'olfactory receptor', 'parallelization', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'vertebrate genome', 'web site']",NHGRI,EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LABORATORY,U24,2020,550000,0.042761935373168955
"Role of Smooth Muscle Calponin in Vascular Pathobiology There is now incontrovertible evidence from sophisticated lineage tracing studies that vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) de-differentiation contributes substantively to a number of vascular diseases. A major manifesta- tion of such phenotypic change is attenuated expression of a battery of VSMC-restricted genes, including the enigmatic smooth muscle calponin (Cnn1) gene. The function of Cnn1 has been studied primarily in vitro or in a single knockout mouse wherein several exons and introns were replaced with a neo cassette which, as detailed below, obfuscates accurate interpretation of phenotypes. We have championed the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system in mice to engineer subtle substitutions within regulatory elements of many genes, leaving intact all coding sequences. We report here a remarkable phenotype wherein a single base change of a single CArG box in the Cnn1 locus abolishes expression of CNN1 in vascular (but not visceral) SMC. Full expression of CNN1 is restored with a BAC carrying human CNN1 or CRISPR-mediated activation of the en- dogenous Cnn1 promoter. Cnn1 CArG mutant mice, representing the first animal models of regulatory element edits, also show elevation in VSMC DNA synthesis and defective contractile competence. Conversely, over- expression of BAC-CNN1 suppresses VSMC growth, antagonizes neointimal formation, reduces VSMC lipid uptake, and enhances contractile gene expression. Interestingly, CNN1-Ser175 appears to be a critical residue for some of these effects making it an attractive amino acid for CRISPR-mediated editing in mice. Additional data support CNN1 as a scaffold for ERK signaling and effector of the immotile state of differentiated VSMC. Importantly, a complete understanding of CNN1 function is complicated by robust expression of two related genes (Cnn2 and Cnn3) in VSMC. We hypothesize that CNN1 functions in concert with other CNN isoforms to maintain a mature VSMC differentiated state. This hypothesis will be tested in three aims using state-of-the-art tools in genetics, animal models of disease, and molecular physiology assays of VSMC function. Aim 1 will exploit the single base edit in Cnn1 as a novel loss-of-function mouse in context of acute and chronic vascular disease models; complementation studies will be carried out in vitro and in vivo to rigorously ascribe pheno- typic changes to the specific loss of CNN1. Aim 2 will exploit a well-characterized BAC mouse to elucidate functions associated with Cnn1 gain-of-function in models of vascular disease used in Aim 1. Complementary CRISPR editing of the BAC mouse, in background of Cnn1 KO, will afford exquisite insight into functional residues that mediate CNN1 function. Aim 3 will exploit new floxed Cnn2 and Cnn3 mice with an exciting VSMC-specific Cre driver we have developed to address, for the first time, triple Cnn KO mouse models at baseline and in acute or chronic vascular disease models. These studies, based on paradigm-shifting approaches to gene KOs, serve as a template for the study of other gene families linked to VSMC differen- tiation and will inform future studies targeting CNN1 in diseases where VSMC differentiation is compromised. Diseases of blood vessels involve radical changes in the normal program of gene expression and function, the underlying nature of which is poorly understood. We have used the revolutionary CRISPR system of genome editing to study a gene called CNN1, which is specific for smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. We will study this gene, along with related genes, in both cells and blood vessels to gain new insights into vascular diseases.",Role of Smooth Muscle Calponin in Vascular Pathobiology,10053587,R01HL136224,"['Actins', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Aneurysm', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Injury', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Cre driver', 'Cytoskeleton', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Growth', 'Hematological Disease', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Injury', 'Introns', 'Ion Channel', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'LoxP-flanked allele', 'MAPK3 gene', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Serum Response Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'base', 'calponin', 'cell growth', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gain of function', 'gene function', 'genome editing', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'insight', 'knockout gene', 'loss of function', 'migration', 'mouse genetics', 'mouse model', 'myocardin', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'response', 'scaffold', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'uptake', 'vascular injury', 'vascular smooth muscle cell migration']",NHLBI,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,571166,0.02299925101297439
"Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline Project Summary Despite extraordinary advances in genome engineering, tools for precise and efficient gene correction and delivery across all cell types remain lacking. Current programmable DNA cleavage tools, such as meganucleases, Zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR- Cas9, rely on recruiting the DNA repair machinery, either using error-prone, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair for gene knockout, or homology directed repair (HDR) for precise correction. However, HDR is inactive in post-mitotic cells, such as neurons, and is often inefficient, achieving 50% correction at most. Genome editing still lacks efficient, robust tools that can insert, delete, and recombine large stretches of DNA sequence. Moreover, delivery tools are a significant barrier to deploying tissue-specific genomic engineering technologies as current vehicles, including widely-used viral vectors and liposomal approaches, have limited capacity, offer variable efficiency, and lack precise tissue tropism. The proposed work involves computationally mining bacteria for new classes of gene editing enzymes and delivery vectors. We know that natural recombinases and transposases can mediate programmed DNA rearrangement and insertion, and these classes of enzymes are present in phage defense and mobile islands in bacteria, which largely remain uncharacterized. Additionally, recent work has demonstrated that retroviral/retrotransposon gag-like proteins can self-assemble and encapsulate nucleic acid in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and viral-like particles (VLPs) for cell-to-cell communication. As with defense islands, these proteins can also be systematically catalogued via a bioinformatic pipeline and experimentally characterized. The proposed work will focus on three main goals: 1) signatures for phage defense, mobile genetic activity, or VLP-forming activity will be mined to build a machine learning pipeline for comprehensively discovering novel gene clusters from novel metagenomic sequences with a focus for proteins that can manipulate nucleic acid or self-assemble, 2) candidate gene clusters will be cloned from metagenomic samples and undergo high-throughput screening using biochemical and bacterial assays for gene editing and capsid formation, as well as engineering to hone activity, and 3) the most promising candidates will be evaluated for activity in mammalian systems with assays for highly efficient gene insertion and VLP formation. The work will elucidate novel bacterial phage defense and VLP biology, and result in the development of new technologies for more efficient genetic manipulation and gene delivery. Moreover, this gene exploration and engineering framework will serve as a model for discovering diverse bacterial gene clusters and defense systems, evaluating biochemical activity across a range of assays, and converting these findings into high impact biotechnologies. The developed technologies will accelerate the pace of biomedical research and enable greater exploration of basic biological processes and disease mechanisms. Project Narrative There are more than 5,000 human diseases caused by known genetic variation, including mutations, insertions, and deletions, but programmable tools and delivery vectors to reliably study and model these diseases are lacking. We propose a two-pronged approach to discovering novel gene editing and delivery strategies by (1) mining bacterial and archaeal systems to identify novel defense systems and enzymes that have activities useful for genome editing and (2) identifying gene clusters linked to extracellular vesicle or viral-like particle formation that will allow development of better gene delivery systems. The technologies developed from this work will accelerate the study and modeling of disease biology and provide a framework for general prokaryotic gene discovery across many biotechnological areas.","Systematic discovery, characterization, and design of novel genome editing and delivery tools using a high-throughput metagenomic screening pipeline",9873379,R21AI149694,"['Animal Model', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacterial Model', 'Bacteriophages', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Capsid', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Elements', 'Encapsulated', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Delivery', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Transfer', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Horizontal Gene Transfer', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Island', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Liposomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mediating', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Mining', 'Mitotic', 'Mobile Genetic Elements', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Nonhomologous DNA End Joining', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phylogeny', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Stretching', 'Study models', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Transposase', 'Viral', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'cell regeneration', 'cell type', 'design', 'environmental adaptation', 'enzyme activity', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fitness', 'gene correction', 'gene delivery system', 'gene discovery', 'gene repair', 'genetic manipulation', 'genetic variant', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'knockout gene', 'new technology', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'particle', 'programs', 'protein profiling', 'recombinase', 'recruit', 'repaired', 'restraint', 'screening', 'technology development', 'tissue tropism', 'tool', 'transcription activator-like effector nucleases', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'vector genome', 'zinc finger nuclease']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2020,188250,0.002188381832024863
"Macrophage Polarization in Response to Infections and Inflammation Abstract Macrophages in Greek means “big eaters"" are powerful cellular components of innate immunity. They play a pivotal role in immune defense by ‘eating’ pathogens, dead or cancerous cells. They also contribute to tissue homeostasis, development and repair. When doing their job, macrophages react to their surroundings and trigger acute inflammation to resolve the problems. They do so by assuming one of the two states that have been widely recognized, i.e., immunoreactive (proinflammatory) and immunotolerant (a.k.a, M1 and M2, respectively). While finite degrees of reactivity and tolerance are desirable in physiology, excess of either state is undesirable and invariably associated with disease pathogenesis (i.e., the Goldilocks conundrum). For example, hyperreactivity is recognized as the root cause of tissue injury in a wide array of diseases (colitis, sepsis, NASH) and hypertolerance is a common determinant that drives most, if not all chronic diseases that are incurable, e.g., cancers. Consensus on the definition of these physiologic and pathologic macrophage states has not been reached, perhaps because of 4 major challenges: heterogeneity, biological robustness, the temporal evolution of the network, and artifacts (tremendous plasticity of macrophages as they drift rapidly when isolated from tissues). We have used a novel computational methodology, Boolean Implication Network [Sahoo 2008], to analyze pooled human macrophage gene expression datasets. This method, which identifies asymmetric gene expression patterns, blurs noise (heterogeneity/artifacts) but reveals a temporal model of events that is invariably seen across all datasets. The analysis revealed hitherto unknown continuum transition states between reactive to tolerant states along five paths; machine-learning identified one of them as the major path which subsequently stood the rigorous test/validation on multiple publicly available transcriptomic datasets, across species (mouse and human), macrophage subtypes and disease states. Most importantly, unlike other commonly used gene cluster signatures, the Boolean path can prognosticate outcomes across diverse diseases. Preliminary validation studies on a genetic model confirm that the path could be exploited for modulating macrophage polarization by altering LPS/TLR4 responses. We will now interrogate the impact of these discoveries using an iterative approach, i.e., model-driven experimentation and experiment-driven model refinement, through three aims: Unravel the importance of novel molecular drivers in the newly identified gene signatures of macrophage polarization using semi-HTP chemical/genetic screens on murine and human monocyte-derived macrophages (Aim 1), in murine disease models of hyperreactivity and hypertolerance (Aim 2) and in “Humanoids”, i.e., human organoid-based microbe/immune cells co-culture models (“gut-in-a-dish”; Aim 3). Although our focus is gastrointestinal infection and inflammation, the findings will define macrophage transition states in multiple organs/disease contexts and therefore, impact many fields. We expect to identify high-value therapeutic targets that can restrict and/or reset macrophage responses to infections and inflammation within the “Goldilocks zone.” Narrative Macrophages are powerful cellular components of innate immunity; on the one hand they play a pivotal role in defending against pathogens, cancerous cells and other harmful stimuli by being immunoreactive, and on the other hand, they contribute to tissue homeostasis by being immunotolerant to harmless antigens and beneficial microbes. Too much or too little of either of these two states (immunoreactive vs. tolerant) can serve as triggers and perpetuate diverse human diseases. Using novel computational approaches, we have charted a formal model for macrophage response to infections, and revealed hitherto unknown important genes that regulate the process of macrophage polarization; we plan to identify potential therapeutic targets that can reprogram macrophage response in disease states.",Macrophage Polarization in Response to Infections and Inflammation,10100201,R01AI155696,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Antigens', 'Arthritis', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cancerous', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colitis', 'Collection', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Adenoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Eating', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Greek', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Immunity', 'Noise', 'Nomenclature', 'Occupations', 'Organ', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'TLR4 gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'adaptive immune response', 'base', 'beneficial microorganism', 'body system', 'bone', 'cell type', 'chemical genetics', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'gastrointestinal infection', 'genetic signature', 'human disease', 'human model', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mouse model', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tissue injury', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'validation studies']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,1000214,0.02125428451764506
"Dynamic regulatory network models of human response to influenza virus PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to build mathematical models of human innate immune responses to the global pathogen influenza virus A (IAV). To ensure successful replication, viral pathogens must simultaneously hijack several components of the host cell machinery while either evading or disabling innate cellular defenses. The host genetic background and subsequent viral and host signaling interactions dictate disease severity ranging from asymptomatic to mortality. Recent studies of IAV in genetically diverse murine models confirm the critical role of genotype in host response and outcome. Both molecular targets as well as key proteins involved in IAV pathogenesis could be therapeutically exploited to attenuate or prevent disease. Thus, we construct models of the molecular networks driving early innate IAV response that can be used to model genetic effects. Our experimental system is human lung epithelium, the first-line of defense against and target of IAV.  Aim 1. Genetic predictions from the gene regulatory network (GRN) governing human epithelial IAV response. GRNs describe the control of gene expression by transcription factors (TFs). We showed that integrating ATAC-seq with RNA-seq improves GRN accuracy. To construct a dynamic GRN in our heterogeneous lung tissue model, we propose scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq measurements of IAV infection and IFNβ stimulation time courses. Our group recently discovered new mechanisms by which the IAV protein Ns1 drives promoter-independent transcriptional “read-through” and alters 3D-chromatin architecture. Thus, for modeling, we also measure genomic transcription initiation and promoter-capture Hi-C. Following experimental testing and GRN refinement, we will use a deep-learning model trained on DNA sequence and epigenetic data to provide inputs that enable dynamic GRN simulations for thousands of human genotypes. We will identify genetic risk loci and molecular mechanisms driving difference in gene expression responses across individuals.  Aim 2. Model the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and cellular signaling networks driving the innate immune response to IAV. We developed mutant influenza viruses, each encoding a FLAG-tagged viral protein, while maintaining virulence in vivo. We will use the mutant IAV to map host-virus PPIs in human lung epithelial cells and mouse lung in vivo. Integrating with diverse ‘omics datasets, we will construct a molecular network model connecting virus-host PPIs through cellular signaling pathways to IAV-dependent TFs. We will test pathway reconstruction with epistasis mapping.  Completion of both aims will lead to a GRN spanning virus-host PPIs and cellular signaling to TF control of gene expression in an innate-immune cell type. Our experimental-computational design is widely applicable. This model, and its future adaptation to other cells, will help identify the genetic and molecular mechanisms driving diverse human IAV responses and the network vulnerabilities to be exploited for IAV therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Human response to Influenza virus infection varies dramatically between individuals, from mildly symptomatic to death. We will systematically measure and model the innate immune response to IAV at the molecular network level: from host-virus protein-protein interactions through cellular signal transduction to changes in gene expression in human cells. The resulting mathematical model will help identify network vulnerabilities to be exploited for IAV therapy and help predict differences in IAV response in the human population.",Dynamic regulatory network models of human response to influenza virus,9950738,U01AI150748,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Affinity Chromatography', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromatin', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza A virus', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferon-beta', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Population', 'Prize', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Role', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tracheal Epithelium', 'Training', 'Transcription Elongation', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'adaptive immune response', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'cytokine', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu', 'forest', 'global health', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human model', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'influenzavirus', 'mathematical model', 'molecular modeling', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'risk variant', 'simulation', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF', 'transcription termination', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2020,1202266,-0.003327736673167918
"Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understand how the relationships between genes contribute to functional properties in neurons and how those functions combine to define types of neurons. This is a central question of basic neuroscience, and one which is newly assessable using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data provide high-throughput snapshots of gene activities across thousands of cells and thus shed new light on the relationships between genes within and across cells. We propose to exploit this data in conjunction with previously known details about gene function and neuronal identity to learn new features of both. Our research approach is meta-analytic, using data from many different laboratories to obtain a more robust aggregate signal. In addition to developing meta-analytic methods to pursue our direct research interests, the methods are of broad practical relevance to neuroscience laboratories studying many different questions, including diseases of the nervous system. Disseminating our software deliverables in a convenient-to-use form is a central component of each of our research objectives. The three complementary objectives in this project are to: 1. Learn patterns of gene expression which characterize known cell identity. Building on our previous research showing conserved expression patterns across cell-types, we will define shared gene expression patterns, called co-expression, specific to neuronal sub-populations. These shared expression patterns will be used as an assay into cellular identity. 2.Identify novel cell subtypes through changes in the expression relationships between genes. Variation in co-expression is a form of transcriptional rewiring which often indicates a change in function. To find novel neuronal sub-types we will assess the data for changes in co-expression reflecting a change in functions linked to neuronal identity. We will identify novel transcriptional signatures which replicate across laboratories. 3. Determine consensus methods for customized cell-type learning. Defining wholly unknown expression profiles is likely to benefit from a variety of approaches. In order to find agreement between those approaches, we will develop an algorithm to efficiently search through gene sets likely to find those with complementary value. These gene sets will then be assessed across many pre-existing methods, with customized combinations and aggregate output reported and made available through a public web-server. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in genetics have it made possible to assess gene activity at a cellular level. The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate methods and data resources which combine data from many laboratories to identify how genes interact to produce different functional effects in different types of neurons. Because most gene functions are accomplished in concert with other genes, knowing how genes change their interactions provides key information into how their function might be disrupted in disease.",Revealing the transcriptomic basis of neuronal identity through functional meta-analysis,9938688,R01MH113005,"['Ablation', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Disease', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'data resource', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web server']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2020,480000,0.04863158789155728
"Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection. Brains transform sensory information into decisions and decisions into behaviors, which ultimately determine fitness. Behavior can be broken down into a set of discrete chunks of movement, called actions. The basal ganglia (BG) and in particular the input nucleus of the BG, the striatum, is critical for the proper sequencing and selection of actions. At a cellular level, the striatum is comprised of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that constitute the direct pathway (dSPNs) and indirect pathway (iSPNs). Under the center-surround model of action selection, dSPNs are thought to facilitate the expression of an action while iSPNs are thought to inhibit the expression of other actions. However, it is not clear how each pathway contributes to action selection due to methodological constraints in acquiring an objectively quantitative description of behavior. Our lab has recently developed a pipeline, known as MoSeq, that acquires high-resolution behavioral data and uses an unsupervised algorithm to model stereotyped pose dynamics (actions or “syllables”). Here I propose to combine this state-of- the-art behavioral acquisition and detection technology with both cellular-resolution imaging and optogenetic perturbation to study the population dynamics underlying action selection in the striatum. I hypothesize that SPNs exhibit syllable-specific tuning, where dSPNs are tightly tuned to facilitate the expression of related syllables, while iSPNs are more broadly tuned to suppress the simultaneous expression of other syllables. I will dissect these two processes by recording and manipulating each SPN class during specific syllable expression. In aim 1, I will perform cellular-resolution recordings of the direct or indirect pathway using genetically encoded calcium indicators and miniaturized microendoscopy in the striatum. I will examine the differential roles of the direct and indirect pathways in the context of behavioral tuning. My preliminary data suggest that dSPNs are more sparsely tuned than iSPNs. In aim 2, I will functionally test the center-surround model via direct and indirect pathway inhibition. I will use the inhibitory anion-conducting rhodopsin, ACR2. Using a system capable of detecting syllable expression in real-time, I will perturb each pathway triggered upon the expression of specific syllables to compare the same selection context across many trials. In summary, the experiments proposed here will contribute to a mechanistic understanding of how the BG performs action selection on a moment-to-moment timescale. This proposal is the first to test the predictions made by the center- surround model and will advance our understanding of how the BG encodes actions. Behavior is constructed from actions that are placed into sequences that enable animals to achieve ethologically relevant goals. The striatum, the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, is critical for the proper selection and expression of actions. My work aims to understand how striatal circuits perform action selection on a moment- to-moment timescale.",Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection.,10026026,F31NS113385,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anions', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Endoscopes', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Postural adjustments', 'Process', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Rhodopsin', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Stereotyping', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'calcium indicator', 'complement pathway', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'indexing', 'microendoscopy', 'miniaturize', 'optogenetics', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2020,33352,0.0034226308483493407
"Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis Abstract Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a significant human pathogen and is the leading cause of sporadic encephalitis in the USA. Strains of virus display virulence phenotypes ranging from avirulent to highly pathogenic. There are indications that the virulence of a given strain of virus is actually determined by the “constellation” of genes carried by the virus and how they interact with each other; a phenomenon termed epistasis. Traditional methods for analyzing the function of viral genes are difficult to apply to studying epistatic interactions in virulence. Recently we described a novel approach, vQTLmap, that has allowed us to identify contributions of multiple genes to peripheral disease phenotypes. To date we have analyzed four quantitative phenotypes, blepharitis, stromal keratitis, corneal neovascularization, and weight loss. Surprisingly, there are distinct differences in the viral genes that appear to be driving each of these phenotypes. In order to carry out vQTLmap using quantitative measures of neurovirulence, we need to isolate additional neurovirulent recombinants between the OD4 and CJ994 parental viruses. The goals of this proposal are to generate the reagents (e.g., neurovirulent recombinants) needed to analyze neurovirulence genes driving HSV-1 encephalitis and identify epistatic interactions and carry out vQTLmap analysis of percent mortality, percent ataxia, percent head tilt, and percent limb paralysis. At the completion of this project, we will be able to submit an R01 application to carry out vQTLmap on features such as percent mortality, brain titers of virus, localization of the infection in the brain, and neuroinvasiveness. A better understanding of how viral genes work together to promote disease has the potential to identify novel targets that could assist antiviral drug or vaccine development efforts. Narrative The role played by viral genes in determining the outcome of infection is poorly understood, particularly for Herpes simplex virus, which is an important pathogen. We have validated a novel approach involving generating recombinant viruses, determining the sequence of their genomes, and using novel statistical methods to map viral genes that affect the severity of the infection. In order to extend the analysis to neurovirulence (encephalitis), we need to isolate more neurovirulent recombinants. The goal of this application is to isolate additional HSV-1 recombinants so we can identify genetic drivers of encephalitis in the HSV-1 genome. The project ultimately has the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets for drug or vaccine development.",Neurovirulent HSV-1 Recombinants for vQTL Analysis,9817679,R21AI137280,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Ataxia', 'Automobile Driving', 'Blepharitis', 'Blindness', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Brain', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Corneal Neovascularization', 'Corneal Ulcer', 'Data', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Eye Infections', 'Female', 'Focal Infection', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Infection', 'Keratitis', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Reagent', 'Recombinants', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Simplexvirus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Physiology', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Work', 'disease phenotype', 'drug development', 'human pathogen', 'innovation', 'male', 'mortality', 'neurovirulence', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'recombinant virus', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2020,229500,0.011636219496005976
"Hematopoietic Stem Cell And Cord Blood Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hematopoietic cell transplantation from unrelated donors, haploidentical related donors and cord blood units can cure life-threatening blood disorders; however, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse and survivorship disparities across different ancestries remain the major obstacles. When matched donors are not available, the properties of HLA mismatches that govern (non)-permissivity are not well-defined. Furthermore, the role of KIR/HLA interactions in modulating relapse remain to be clarified. These deficiencies have important implications for a large fraction of patients who lack HLA-matched donors, and for all patients at risk for disease relapse. We have demonstrated that HLA class I leader peptides, HLA-DP expression, and HLA/KIR interactions each contribute to GVHD, relapse and mortality. The unmet needs are to understand the mechanisms through which HLA and KIR genes modulate transplant risks, and a means to apply the research findings to clinical care. We propose to define the underlying mechanisms through which HLA and KIR genes and proteins function in transplantation, and develop tools for using HLA and KIR in the selection of the optimal transplant donor and cord blood unit. The specific aims are to: define the role of HLA-DP expression and peptide-binding groove pocket in GVHD; define NKG2/HLA-E interactions and HLA-G in GVHD and relapse; define the role for KIR and HLA interaction in relapse after HCT for acute leukemia, and design tools to evaluate gene features in clinical practice. The goals will be achieved through systemic analysis of individual gene variation, haplotypes of genes, and receptor/ligand recognition in large ethnically diverse transplant populations with complete clinical data. This proposal will fill the knowledge gap in the immunobiological basis of GVHD, relapse and survivorship disparities in transplantation. The information will increase the safety, efficacy and availability of transplantation for all patients in need of this life-saving therapy.

"Development of methods for transcript quantification and differential expression analysis using long-read sequencing technologies. The rapid development of Third Generation, Long Read Sequencing (LRS) platforms such as Pacbio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) have enabled increasing precision and higher-throughput sequencing of transcripts. Long reads can produce full-length transcript sequences, overcoming much of the uncertainty of short-read methods to accurately define transcripts, particularity for those genes with alternative splicing (more than 90% of human genes), for which short read sequencing has thus far proved difficult. LRS is therefore the natural choice for the study of the expression of transcript variants and of the role of alternative isoforms in disease and development. While the first iterations of the long-read technologies did not produce enough reads to quantify more than the highest expressed transcripts, the current sequencing depth of up to 8 million reads per SMRT cells on the Sequel 2 platforms promises reliable quantifiability for more modestly expressed genes. Also significant yield increases have been reported for Nanopore. This suggests that LRS may have reached sufficient throughput to enable accurate quantification of gene expression and differential expression analyses. LRS transcriptomics data have, however, specific properties that are absent in other transcriptomics technologies, such are partial matches of reference transcript models. Therefore specific methods for quantification and statistical analysis need to be developed. In this Project, we aim to characterize in detail the data distribution in long reads data, propose strategies to deal with their particular read uncertainty issues and develop new strategies for differential expression analysis. The overarching goal is to create the analytical framework to fully leverage LRS technologies for the study of isoform dynamics in relation of biomedical relevant questions. The goal of this project is to develop the SQANTI-QDE software, the first integral framework for the management of long read sequencing Iso-seq experiments. SQANTI-QDE will provide, in one tool, functionalities for the annotation and processing of multiple samples, improved definition of bona-fide transcripts, quantification of transcript expression, flexible creation of count matrices, data normalization, and differential expression and isoform usage analysis.

"REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  PROJECT SUMMARY  DNA motifs bind transcription factors (TFs) that control gene expression in normal and diseased skin. AR45192 recently mapped the enhancers and promoters that are sequentially activated during epidermal differentiation, and found them enriched for 15 conserved DNA motif combinations, or DNA motif “grammars”. This suggested that these grammars, acting through recruitment of motif-binding TFs, may encode the DNA sequence logic that coordinates the temporal and spatial induction of early and late epidermal differentiation genes. AR45192 also found that these grammars were recurrently altered by single nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs, for “expression SNPs”) linked by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to skin diseases characterized by disrupted epidermal differentiation, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This suggests that newly identified DNA motif grammars may control differentiation and that their disruption may contribute to disease pathogenesis.  Aim I will test the hypothesis that specific DNA motif grammars control the physiologic activation of differentiation genes necessary for normal epidermal function. First, it will define the temporal activity of hundreds of examples of each grammar in early and late differentiation within intact epidermis. Second, it will quantitate epidermal differentiation gene expression and barrier function in isogenic epidermal tissues in which a subset of grammars have been altered by gene-editing. Aim I is designed to characterize the actions of newly identified DNA motif grammars in epidermal differentiation.  Aim II will test the hypothesis that SCC risk eSNPs residing within epidermal differentiation motif grammars alter gene expression in a way that enhances cancer progression. First, it will define SCC eSNP impacts on gene expression in normal epidermis with a goal to understanding the altered target genes, and their biologic functions, that predispose to SCC risk. Second, it will quantitatively assess the impact of these SCC risk eSNPs, singly and in combination, on neoplastic progression of epidermal neoplasia in vivo. Aim II is designed to define the impact of regulatory DNA variants on epidermal gene expression and disease progression.  This AR45192 competing renewal will characterize the role of newly identified regulatory DNA grammars in epidermal homeostasis and neoplastic progression. RELEVANCE  Abnormal differentiation is a hallmark of common skin diseases, such as epidermal cancers, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and certain ichthyoses. Transcription factors (TFs) bind DNA motifs in enhancers to control differentiation gene expression in skin and other tissues. Characterizing the patterns of normal and disease-linked DNA sequence motifs that control epidermal differentiation may be of broad utility in the future treatment and prevention of skin disorders. REGULATORS OF EPIDERAL GENE EXPRESSION  Project Narrative The control of gene expression determines the health or disease of human tissues, including skin. Systematic definition of the regulatory DNA motif combinations in homeostasis and early cancer progression is designed to provide information to advance human health for skin and other tissues. 1",REGULATORS OF EPIDERMAL GENE EXPRESSION,9873543,R01AR045192,"['ATAC-seq', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dependovirus', 'Differentiated Gene', 'Diploidy', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enhancers', 'Epidermis', 'Future', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Ichthyoses', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-in', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Psoriasis', 'Recurrence', 'Reporter', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'design', 'gene induction', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'keratinocyte', 'keratinocyte differentiation', 'neural network algorithm', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'skin barrier', 'skin disorder', 'skin squamous cell carcinoma', 'transcription factor', 'tumor progression']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,504604,-0.0025443045573494845

"Aortic Valve Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches Aortic valve stenosis is the major cause of valve disease in the Western world, and the third leading cause of adult heart disease. It is a progressive disorder that worsens with age. Thickening of the aortic valve is followed by calcification that results in further stenosis that ultimately necessitates surgical replacement. A major risk factor for calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), which is present in 1–2% of the population, and involves formation of a two- rather than three-valve leaflet. ~35% of individuals with BAV will develop CAVD with age, but some with BAV have thickening even in childhood, requiring intervention. There are no medical treatments available for CAVD patients, and the only clinical option is surgical valve replacement. We reported that heterozygous nonsense mutations in the NOTCH1 (N1) transcription factor cause congenital biscuspid aortic valve (BAV) and severe CAVD and evidence suggests N1 is haploinsufficient in valve endothelial cells (ECs). Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived ECs from several patients with CAVD and N1 haploinsufficiency showed increased expression of pro-osteogenic and inflammatory signaling. Network analysis revealed key nodes that were responsible for much of the gene dysregulation. A chemical screen for the ability to restore expression of 120 dysregulated genes by targeted RNA-sequencing revealed several drugs that restored the network close to the N1+/+ state in human iPSC-ECs, with one, XCT790, showing efficacy in vivo for aortic valve thickening, calcification and stenosis in a mouse model. XCT790 is annotated to function as an inhibitor of estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα). We now propose to test the hypotheses that XCT790 prevents aortic valve disease by inhibiting ERRα activity, can treat established disease, and can function in a subset of CAVD patient cells without N1 mutations. The aims are 1) to determine the mechanism of action by which XCT790 corrects disease-associated gene expression and prevents aortic valve disease; 2) to determine if XCT790 can treat established CAVD or prevent neonatal valve stenosis; and 3) to determine if gene dysregulation in primary aortic valve endothelial cells from sporadic CAVD patients with or without genetic variants in NOTCH1 pathway genes is responsive to XCT790. These studies will advance a potential therapeutic to treat a disease that represents an enormous unmet medical need, is characterized by high mortality and morbidity, and for which the only current remedy is a highly invasive surgery. Aortic valve disease is the third most common form of heart disease and one of the most difficult to treat pediatric diseases. In adults, calcification and thickening lead to need for surgical replacement, with no medical therapy available. In this proposal we test the mechanism by which a novel small molecule therapeutic prevents aortic valve calcification in mice, test the clinical scenarios in which it may be efficacious and determine the range of patients who may benefit from this therapy by examining the response of cells derived from individuals with valve disease.",Aortic Valve Disease: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches,9867301,R01HL150100,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'ERR1 protein', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Estrogen Antagonists', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NOTCH1 gene', 'Neonatal', 'Nonsense Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Pulmonary Valve Stenosis', 'Reporting', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stenosis', 'Surgical Valves', 'Telomerase RNA Component', 'Telomere Shortening', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Western World', 'aging population', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve disorder', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'calcification', 'cell type', 'drug testing', 'endothelial stem cell ', 'exome sequencing', 'gene correction', 'genetic variant', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'malformation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'osteogenic', 'prevent', 'response', 'shear stress', 'small molecule libraries', 'small molecule therapeutics', 'telomere', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic target', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'valve replacement']",NHLBI,J.

"Redefining mesenchymal stem cells: using their cellular and molecular phenotypes to determine their regenerative and therapeutic properties ABSTRACT Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have broad-based potential in regenerative medicine cell therapies and can be isolated from a variety of different tissues. Though MSCs from different tissues are phenotypically similar, a barrier to their clinical use is the high variability of their trophic and regenerative properties. This variability suggests that inherent differences exist in the molecular machinery guiding MSC properties between different MSC populations, yet, to date, these differences are ill-defined. To this end, we have preliminary evidence that MSC phenotypes correlate to their regenerative outcomes. In this study, we aim to elucidate how the molecular and cellular properties of distinct MSC populations determine their regenerative properties. Our hypothesis is that MSCs from different tissues have different regenerative properties which correlate to specific molecular profiles defined by gene expression and transcriptional activity. To test this hypothesis, the project proposed has three Specific Aims (SAs). In SA1, we will determine how tissue-specificity dictates gene expression and dynamic transcription factor activity of distinct MSCs. SA2 will determine how differences in the cellular and molecular properties of MSCs correlate to MSC phenotype. Finally, in SA3, we will determine how the molecular profiles and cellular activities of MSCs dictate their regenerative properties. Findings of the proposed study will provide novel insights about how the distinct molecular profiles of MSCs dictate their biological and physiological properties. In a therapeutic context, this would enable the development of innovative screening technologies for MSC therapies to identify and enrich for the most appropriate MSC for the specific therapeutic application. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Stem cell therapies are emerging as a new treatment approach to regenerate lost tissues, treat ischemic disorders, and treat chronic inflammatory conditions. Many of these approaches use stem cells from adults which are present in various regions throughout the body. Our research team is working to better understand how and why these adult stem cells behave the way they do so that we can better determine how to use them in different therapies to treat debilitating health conditions.",Redefining mesenchymal stem cells: using their cellular and molecular phenotypes to determine their regenerative and therapeutic properties,9954044,R01DE028657,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Angiogenic Factor', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Regeneration', 'Bone Tissue', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Pulp', 'Development', 'Disease', 'ENG gene', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gingiva', 'Health', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Muscle', 'Natural regeneration', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Osteogenesis', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Production', 'Property', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tooth structure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adult stem cell', 'alveolar bone', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical translation', 'healthy volunteer', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular phenotype', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'oral tissue', 'osteogenic', 'population based', 'regenerative', 'regenerative therapy', 'screening', 'self-renewal', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell population', 'stem cell therapy', 'stem cells', 'stemness', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,405389,-0.008303085141984329
"Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen The impact of fungal pathogens on human health is devastating. They infect billions of people worldwide, and kill more than 1.5 million each year. The most vulnerable are people with reduced immune function, such as those with HIV or those undergoing immune suppressing treatments for cancer or organ transplants. One of the most pervasive fungal pathogens is Candida albicans, which kills almost 40% of people suffering from bloodstream infections. Treating these infections is extremely difficult, as fungi are closely related to humans and there are very few drugs that kill the fungus without host toxicity. With the emergence of drug resistance, the development of new therapeutic strategies is now crucial. To address this important clinical need and identify new antifungal drug targets, it is critical to uncover mechanisms that enable C. albicans to cause life-threatening human disease.  We are one of the first academic labs to obtain a powerful resource that will allow us to test the function of almost every gene in the C. albicans genome. This resource includes a collection of double barcoded heterozygous mutants covering ~90% of the genome, and a collection of strains covering ~40% of the genome where the expression of the remaining wild-type allele of a gene is governed by the tetracycline-repressible promoter. This resource provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify genes that control key virulence traits such as morphogenesis. It also enables the identification of determinants of commensalism and virulence, and to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. We have optimized a functional genomics platform for massively parallel analysis of fungal virulence traits using next generation sequencing to quantify the relative proportion of each barcoded strain in pooled assays. We have also optimized high- resolution image analysis of cellular morphology and structures, and assays for identifying genes important for commensalism, virulence, and interaction with host immune cells. Our studies will provide the first global analysis of C. albicans morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence.  Our studies will: 1) develop a computational platform to predict C. albicans essential genes, and expand the collection of tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains to cover most non-essential genes, since genes required for pathogen viability in vitro provide little insight into mechanisms of host adaptation or virulence; 2) identify novel regulators of key virulence traits such as morphogenesis; and 3) identify determinants of C. albicans host adaptation and virulence on a genome scale. This work will provide an expanded functional genomics resource to advance the field, and will leverage this resource to elucidate the genes and genetic networks governing morphogenesis and virulence. This will reveal new strategies to cripple fungal pathogens, and drug targets to improve clinical outcome. The focus of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This eukaryotic pathogen has a profound impact on human health, with a global incidence of Candida bloodstream infections of ~400,000 cases, associated with crude mortality rates of 42% and attributable mortality rates of 27%; C. albicans is the most prevalent Candida species in almost all patient populations. The central hypotheses that govern this proposal are that functional genomic analysis of C. albicans using genome-scale libraries of double barcoded heterozygous gene deletion mutants and tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains will reveal novel circuitry governing morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence, and that targeting this circuitry has therapeutic potential for combating life-threatening fungal infections.","Systematic Analysis of Morphogenesis, Commensalism, and Virulence in a Leading Human Fungal Pathogen",9985737,R01AI127375,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Aneuploidy', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Ascomycota', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Candida', 'Candida albicans', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Structures', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Cytolysis', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Essential Genes', 'Filament', 'Foundations', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Library', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Mycoses', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sepsis', 'Solid', 'Symbiosis', 'Systemic infection', 'Testing', 'Tetracyclines', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'attributable mortality', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer transplantation', 'combat', 'computational platform', 'fitness', 'functional genomics', 'fungus', 'gene replacement', 'genome-wide', 'genomic platform', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'immune function', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'mucosal microbiota', 'mutant', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'patient population', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'trait', 'unpublished works']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2020,545004,0.023432077400649582
"Intestinal Homeostasis Induced by Commensals ABSTRACT While multidrug-resistance transporters including P-gp and MRP2 are generally studied for their role in exporting drugs and foreign compounds from the cell, our studies indicate that these efflux pumps expressed at the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells provide a critical link in communication between sentinel functions of mucosal barriers and the immune system. Understanding how this P-gp/eCB anti-inflammatory arm is regulated will provide crucial insight into how dysfunction may promote intestinal inflammation and help identify potential new therapeutic targets. Because the resident microbiota is known to contribute to tolerance and homeostasis in the healthy intestine, the central hypothesis we aim to test is whether the normal microbiota actively drives the P-gp/eCB axis to prevent unnecessary inflammation. Our pilot studies indicate that the microbiota does influence P-gp expression and function, providing a unique foundation for further cause-effect studies. No data have previously demonstrated a link between the microbiota and eCBs or any other epithelial lipid signals, and may well provide great insight into a novel system. Bridging this gap could help explain how commensal bacteria can stabilize a state of tolerance and how genetic modification of specific pathway elements might predispose individuals to conditions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To begin addressing these questions, in Aim 1 of this application will combine in vitro (including human colonoids) and in vivo murine model systems, as well as use healthy and UC patient stool, to more deeply understand the microbial consortia that collectively maximize P-gp expression and function. Aim 2 is designed to identify the microbial metabolites that drive activation of P-gp expression and eCB secretion to maintain an anti-inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium. Thus, transcriptomics and metabolite analyses will be performed to provide new information regarding microbial genes, gene clusters, and their metabolic products implicated in maintaining an anti- inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium through regulation of the P-gp/eCB axis. In Aim 3 we will employ novel computational methods will to uncover the inter-microbial network responses and the ecological structure of a stable community that is able to induce P-gp expression. Collectively, knowledge of the pathways that coordinate the maintenance of the P-gp/eCB axis will require a comprehensive understanding of distinct signals regulating intestinal homeostasis, how multiple signals are integrated in the complex intestinal environment, and pathways that modulate host-microbe interactions. Consequently, this proposal will directly advance novel biological principles with guidance of new therapeutic intervention strategies. Public Health Narrative Regulated recruitment and migration of acute inflammatory cells termed neutrophils (PMN) into the intestine and across the specialized epithelium that lines it is critical for host defense, yet dysregulation of this process is associated with disease. Because the resident microbiota is known to contribute to tolerance and homeostasis in the healthy intestine, the goal of this proposal will examine whether the normal microbiota actively drives the P-gp/eCB axis to maintain a homeostatic anti-inflammatory tone in the intestinal epithelium. Understanding this process could help explain how commensal bacteria can stabilize a state of tolerance and how genetic modification of specific pathway elements might predispose individuals to conditions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).",Intestinal Homeostasis Induced by Commensals,10029718,R01DK125407,"['ABCB1 gene', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Apical', 'Bile Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Cells', 'Colitis', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Environment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethanolamines', 'Eubacterium', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Intestines', 'Invaded', 'Knowledge', 'Lactobacillus', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'P-Glycoprotein', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Pump', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Submucosa', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Work', 'Xenobiotic Metabolism', 'arm', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'commensal bacteria', 'design', 'efflux pump', 'first responder', 'healing', 'host colonization', 'host-microbe interactions', 'in vivo', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'innate immune mechanisms', 'insight', 'intestinal epithelium', 'intestinal homeostasis', 'mathematical model', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'normal microbiota', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'nuclear factor 1', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'theories', 'transcriptomics']",NIDDK,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,560048,0.011916121506035179
"Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis Despite major advances in prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), it remains a major cause of deaths worldwide. As ASCVD is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and impact on this unmet residual risk. One such human polymorphism in the ID3 gene (rs11574) was associated with ASCVD in 3 distinct human cohorts. Notably, this SNP significantly attenuates ID3 function and studies in pre-clinical models confirm a critical role for ID3 in atheroprotection. We have previously shown that loss of ID3 inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and promotes VSMC expression of inflammatory factors, processes linked to increase atherosclerosis. In collaboration with Dr. Gary Owens, we have generated a mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and VSMC-specific deletion of ID3 to study ID3-dependent VSMC specific changes during the course of lesion development in the context of the whole animal. We have developed a comprehensive CyTOF panel to identify and quantitate key cellular and intracellular changes in VSMC and other lesional cells in the aorta during the course of atherosclerosis development in these mice. To translate murine findings to humans, we have utilized CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering to knock out ID3 and produce the full allelic series of rs11574 in human cells and validated a reproducible system for differentiation of human inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to VSMC. We will quantify the changes in VSMC phenotype in iPSC-derived VSMC with the full allelic series of rs11574. To further translate murine findings to humans, intravascular ultrasound virtual histology (IVUS-VH) will be measured in human coronary arteries and analyzed with cutting edge image analysis techniques in collaboration with Dr. Milan Sonka at the University of Iowa. As such, our group is uniquely poised to dissect the role of this ASCVD-associated SNP and translate findings to humans. We hypothesize: that loss of ID3 in VSMCs will inhibit VSMC growth and promote a phenotype that exacerbates vessel wall inflammation and atherosclerosis lesion development; that human ID3 encoded by the risk allele aggravates these atherogenic VSMC functions; and that human subjects with the risk allele have larger coronary plaques with increased fatty deposits, necrotic cores and calcification compared to subjects homozygous for the common allele. As atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and further impact on ASCVD morbidity and mortality. Human ID3 gene polymorphism at rs11574 is associated with ASCVD in three unique human cohorts. Preliminary data supports a key role for ID3 in vascular smooth muscle cell biology linked to ASCVD. In the current proposal, we will utilize a novel mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and specific deletion of ID3 to elucidate the role of ID3 in promoting atherogenic VSMCs. We will then utilize CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in human inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived VSMCs to identify the VSMC processes altered by the ID3 gene mutation linked to CVD. Lastly, we will determine if this ID3 gene mutation, alone or in combination with other gene mutations are associated with the amount and type of atherosclerotic plaque in human coronary arteries as measured by intravascular ultrasound virtual histology. Results have the potential to lead to novel targeted therapy for atherosclerosis.",Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis,10004164,R01HL148109,"['Alanine', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Aorta', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Heritability', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Iowa', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Necrosis', 'Null Lymphocytes', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Residual state', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Threonine', 'Translating', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'calcification', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcium', 'coronary plaque', 'dimer', 'genome editing', 'human subject', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'oxidized low density lipoprotein', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2020,671017,0.007282907932536309
"Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency Project Abstract Haploinsufficiency plays a crucial role in Neurofibromatosis (NF1), an autosomal dominant genetic disorder impacting over 120,000 individuals in the United States. Current therapeutic approaches focus on specific components of NF1 signaling, for example inhibiting MEK signaling pathways in tumors, thus failing to address the broad range of signaling and symptoms associated with NF1. Given that NF1 is characterized by both autosomal dominance and haploinsufficiency (lack of normal protein), upregulating protein expression of the remaining wild-type NF1 allele has the ability to compensate for loss of function from the mutant allele, thus alleviating a broad range of NF1 symptoms and overall disease progression. Infixion proposes to build a luciferase reporting assay to evaluate NF1 expression against known drugs, including 50+ compounds, across six drug classes, already identified by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression. By confirming that these candidate drugs activate NF1 transcription, increase NF1 protein expression, and normalize Ras pathway signaling in NF1 +/- Schwann cells, and by further screening libraries of known drugs for increased NF1 expression, we propose a novel path of NF1 drug discovery that will impact a broad range of NF1 patients and symptoms, in a preventative manner, and without regard to the wide spectrum of NF1 genetic mutations. Research Background. Increasing NF1 expression via transfection reverses abnormal Ras activation resulting from NF1 loss (Wallis, et al. 2018). Transcriptional activation in other genetic conditions such as Willams-Beuren Syndrome, and Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis compensates for haploinsufficiency (Giordano, et al. 2012). Lastly, overcoming haploinsufficiency in another autosomal dominant condition (Sim1 induced obesity; mouse model) was recently shown using a Crispr/dCas9 transcriptional activator (Ahituv, et al. 2019). Specific Aims. 1) Construct a luciferase reporter assay engineered into the endogenous NF1 gene of a well characterized, publically available, immortalized NF1 +/- Schwann cell line (Wallace et al. 2016; data published at Synapse.org). Validate assay using a viral transcription factor developed by Infixion using Crispr/dCas9 to upregulate NF1. 2) Deploy this NF1 luciferase reporter assay to screen 50+ known drugs shown by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression across various cell/tissue types. Next, use this validated luciferase reporter to screen a 13,000+ compound repurposing library of known drugs available from Scripps Research Institute (known as ReFrame). 3) The top hits from Aim 2 screens will be evaluated, utilizing both immortalized and iPSC derived NF1+/- Schwann cells, for the following: a) ability to induce NF1 mRNA and protein expression, using qPCR and Westerns, b) the impact on Ras signaling (pERK, ELK-1, AKT, etc.) utilizing a targeted quantitative mass spec proteomics assay, c) their broader impact on gene expression in Schwann cells utilizing RNAseq, d) impact on cell proliferation, and e) their safety profile based on published data from previous trials. The goal is to prioritize not more than 3-5 candidates to take forward into a Phase 2 evaluation. Project Narrative Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that impacts an estimated 1 in 3000 people worldwide, and one that is characterized by a complex set of symptoms shown to be dependent on haploinsufficiency (i.e., the lack of normal protein). By upregulating NF1 protein expression from the normal allele by two-fold, and thus restoring normal levels of functional NF1 protein in tissues important in NF1, we target a range of NF1 symptoms by eliminating the haploinsufficient environment. We propose to develop and utilize NF1-specific luciferase reporter and proteomic assays, along with standard small molecule evaluation tools, to characterize a small molecule library of repurposed drugs for their ability to upregulate NF1 transcription, and to further evaluate the resulting impact of “hits” on NF1 protein expression, cell proliferation, gene expression specificity, as well as downstream pathways (such as Ras, MEK, mTOR) known to be dysregulated by mutations in the NF1 gene.",Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency,10010298,R43NS117234,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cutaneous', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Dominant Genetic Conditions', 'Drug Screening', 'ELK1 gene', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterozygote', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Luciferases', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modification', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Obese Mice', 'Orphan Drugs', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reagent', 'Regimen', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Schwann Cells', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure of thyroid parafollicular cell', 'Supravalvular aortic stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcend', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Williams Syndrome', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'combat', 'commercialization', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'gene expression database', 'gene therapy', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput screening', 'in vivo Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Expression', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'phase 2 testing', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NINDS,"INFIXION BIOSCIENCE, INC.",R43,2020,299503,0.00768509741190268
