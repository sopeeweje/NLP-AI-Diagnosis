"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9600692,R01DC013996,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American Sign Language', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow up assessment', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'language comprehension', 'language disorder diagnosis', 'phonology', 'psychiatric symptom', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'school district', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'social communication', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,568221,0.1341935197792712
"An Individualized Vocabulary Intervention for Dual Language Learners Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this proposed project is to examine the feasibility of an individualized vocabulary intervention program for preschool dual language learners (DLL) from low socioeconomic (SES) backgrounds. Children who grow up in low SES and language minority homes (L1) and learn English (L2) as a second language in school settings are likely to be at risk for reading difficulties and poor academic performance (e.g., August et al., 2006). In order to serve the particular needs of DLLs from diverse backgrounds, scientific evidence is critically needed about the intervention strategies for these preschoolers. In this proposed study, we examine the feasibility of using machine learning methods to generate individually tailored interventions for low SES dual language learners who learn two typologically different languages, Cantonese (L1) and English (L2). Two important strategies will be used in this study. First, a computation model will be built to predict and select appropriate bilingual target words for individual DLLs. Second, this intervention will be integrated into the extant preschool curriculum, thus resulting in a potentially sustainable, scalable approach to decreasing language proficiency gaps. There are two specific aims in this proposed study: 1. Model normative lexical development in Cantonese-English DLLs. We will leverage  data previously collected by Dr. Kan on Cantonese-English vocabulary development at  Head Start Centers, and computational models of typical lexical development in monolingual  English speakers, to build a computational model of typical bilingual lexical development in  Cantonese-English dual language learners. 2. Evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a model-based individualized vocabulary  intervention program. We will use the computational model to make individual level target  word recommendations for 200 Cantonese-English DLLs, and work with teachers at 8 Head  Start centers to integrate the recommendations into their existing curriculum. The goal of this project is to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of using machine learning methods to develop an individualized, personalized vocabulary intervention programs for preschool dual language learners from low socioeconomic backgrounds. The individualized intervention program for each child will be integrated into the extant preschool curriculum, thus resulting in a potentially sustainable, scalable approach to decreasing language proficiency gaps.",An Individualized Vocabulary Intervention for Dual Language Learners,9771334,R21HD092837,"['Address', 'Child', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Head Start Program', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Justice', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Nursery Schools', 'Performance', 'Preventive', 'Recommendation', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Testing', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'design', 'follow-up', 'intervention program', 'kindergarten', 'learning strategy', 'lexical', 'low socioeconomic status', 'peer', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'reading difficulties', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'teacher']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R21,2019,186473,0.07919143482446003
"Structural and functional connectivity markers of developmental speech and language disorders ABSTRACT Developmental speech and language disorders affect an estimated 15% of children and have lifelong impacts on social and emotional development and employment. Two common neurodevelopmental disorders are developmental language disorder (DLD; also called specific language impairment) and developmental stuttering, affecting 7% and 5% of children respectively. Despite their prevalence and immense impact, little is known of the neural causes, correlates, and consequences of these common neurodevelopmental disorders; thus, effective treatment remains elusive. In the proposed project, we will study the neural underpinnings of these disorders using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study structural and functional neural connectivity. Previous studies of connectivity in these populations are limited and show little consensus, likely due in part to small sample sizes. Theoretical accounts of both disorders implicate dysfunctional neural circuits through the basal ganglia. In the current proposal, we will test and compare the structural and functional integrity of neural pathways in large cohorts of people with DLD (N=80) and people who stutter (PWS; N=80) and compare them with similar data obtained in age- and sex-matched control groups of people with typical development (N=160). First, we will assess connectivity in speech/language-specific networks, using diffusion data to assess structural connectivity and resting-state data to assess functional connectivity. Results will indicate abnormalities in connectivity in large cohorts of PWS and people with DLD. In each disorder, we will also determine connectivity contributions to individual differences in behavior. This will reveal how different connectivity patterns are correlated to differences in severity along relevant dimensions (e.g., fluency, language measures), ideally resulting in neural correlates of the disorders. Finally, we will evaluate whole-brain functional connectivity differences between each disorder group and its matched control group using data-driven machine learning approaches. Results will indicate patterns of neural activity that differentiate these disorders from controls. The outcome of this proposal will be the characterization of underlying network differences in these populations, which will ideally lead to the development of targeted behavioral and neuro-modulatory treatments of these multifaceted and pervasive disorders. Research and training will take place at the University of Oxford, an ideal environment in which to pursue this line of research. The applicant will be mentored by world-leading researchers with the knowledge needed to guide him in this work, including expertise in the neural bases of developmental speech and language disorders, cutting-edge methodology in neuroimaging, and machine learning. Achieving these aims will illuminate the neural correlates of these speech and language disorders as well as prepare the applicant for an independent research career in this area. PROJECT NARRATIVE For a surprisingly large number of children, as many as 15%, speech and language development does not go smoothly and results in disorders such as stuttering or language delay. We wish to understand more about the causes of these common disorders and will assess whether the brain networks involved in speech and language development are impaired in people with developmental language disorder and stuttering. Using large existing neuroimaging datasets obtained in these disorders will allow us to address important questions about the causes and consequences of these developmental disorders.",Structural and functional connectivity markers of developmental speech and language disorders,9757857,F32DC017637,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Stuttering', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Motor', 'Network-based', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Speech Development', 'Speech Disorders', 'Structure', 'Stuttering', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'caudate nucleus', 'cohort', 'developmental disease', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'interest', 'language impairment', 'motor control', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroregulation', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'specific language impairment', 'standardize measure']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,F32,2019,65354,-0.00030313814051674824
"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment (PLI) emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, identification in toddlers is not currently possible because of the high rate of false positives reflecting transient language delays. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, neurodevelopmental approach to generate earlier, more accurate identification of toddler risk for persistent PLI via: (a) multi-faceted, longitudinal assessment of toddler emergent language patterns; (b) detailed consideration of the transactional language environment; and (c) accounting for emergent health risk in predictive models. Earlier, reliable identification of toddlers at highest risk for PLI will optimize early intervention to prevent developmentally- cascading effects.",The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment,9829606,R01DC016273,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'model building', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'standard measure', 'translational approach']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,34593,0.13198555827704725

"Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence ABSTRACT  Approximately 15% of toddlers 18-36 months of age experience late language emergence (LLE; Paul, 1992; Singleton, 2018). These late talkers (LTs) have a reduced expressive vocabulary, but average non-linguistic abilities, in the absence of overt sensory or other developmental delays (Collisson, 2016; Paul & Jennings, 1992). Upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for language disorder (Rescorla, 2009), while others retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). LTs are at elevated risk for lifelong language and literacy impairments that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Singleton, 2018; Paul, 1993), and even subclinical outcomes have pervasive negative impacts (Rescorla, 2002). This project addresses questions crucial for the early diagnosis of LTs and prerequisite to the applicant’s long-term goal of establishing an independent research program on LLE, aimed ultimately at identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes to provide a foundation for more targeted interventions for LTs. This project complements prior work on LLE focused on language production by evaluating the time course of word learning and spoken word recognition in LTs and 2 control groups (age- and language-matched typically developing peers), all of whom will complete standardized assessments of cognitive -linguistic abilities. In Expt. 1, participants will train on a simple selection task using 4 novel and 4 familiar words that overlap phonologically (e.g., at onset, BUNNY-BUTTON, or offset, KITTEN-MITTEN). We will use eye tracking to estimate group and individual differences in lexical activation and competition over time. In Expt. 2, we will record EEG (electroencephalography) in a passive listening task. Participants will watch a silent video as newly-learned and familiar words from Expt. 1 are repeated. ERP (event-related potential) analyses will examine individual and group differences in responses to newly-learned vs. familiar words. We will also use machine-learning (support vector machines, SVMs) to decode EEG responses to specific words for each participant, on the logic that fidelity and coherence of responses will determine SVM classification success. Group and individual differences in eye tracking, ERP, and/or EEG-decoding measures will provide new insights into receptive abilities of LTs, and provide a basis for future work aimed at identifying LTs with greatest risk for clinical or subclinical language outcomes. The project will take place at the U. of Connecticut and Haskins Labs. The applicant and sponsors have developed a training plan for the applicant focused on further developing her (1) EEG and statistical skills, (2) knowledge base of the cognitive neuroscience of typical and atypical language development, (3) dissemination skills, and (4) understanding of principles for the responsible conduct of research, with the aim of supporting her goal to be an independent researcher in a Research-1 environment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Approximately 15% of toddlers meet criteria for being a late talker (LT) (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018;) and upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for spoken and/or written language disorder (Rescorla, 2009) while another subset will retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). Late language emergence (LLE) is associated with lifelong clinical and subclinical weaknesses in language and literacy that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018), and even subclinical outcomes have a negative impact on vocational and higher educational choices (Rescorla, 2002). The proposed research will address questions prerequisite to the applicant's long-term goal of establishing an independent research program aimed at (1) identifying early markers of chronic impact in order to optimally allocate scarce early intervention resources and (2) identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes which will provide the foundation for more focused and targeted forms of interventions for LTs with a range of clinical and subclinical language outcomes.",Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence,9836112,F31DC018220,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Control Groups', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Endowment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exclusion', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Morphology', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'language impairment', 'language outcome', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'literacy', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'peer', 'phonology', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'skills', 'social', 'sound', 'success', 'trait', 'word learning']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,F31,2019,40450,0.10828564410730682
"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia.

These abilities lie at the heart of language and speech processing, and their success or failure has profound impacts on quality of life across the lifespan. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that support these basic abilities holds promise for advancing assistive listening devices, and for improving diagnoses and treatments for learning disabilities and communication disorders, such as auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, and specific language impairment. Non-invasive neuroscience techniques in humans reveal the loci of language-related processing but do not answer how individual neurons and neural circuits implement language-relevant computations. Thus, circuit-level neuro-computational mechanisms that support acoustic communication signal processing remain poorly understood. Multiple lines of research suggest that songbirds can provide an excellent model for investigating shared auditory processing abilities relevant to language. This proposal investigates neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing abilities shared between songbirds and humans. In Aim 1, we test the cellular-level predictions of a powerful modelling framework, called predictive coding, proposed as a general computational mechanism to support the learned recognition of complex temporally patterned signals at multiple timescales. We combine state-of-the-art machine learning methods with multi-electrode electrophysiology, to test explicit models for natural stimulus representation, prediction, and error coding in single cortical neurons and neural populations. One aspect of auditory perception integral to speech is the discretization of the signal into learned categorically perceived sounds (phonemes). In Aim 2, we use the predictive coding framework to investigate the learned categorical perception of natural auditory categories in populations of cortical neurons. In humans, the transition statistics between adjacent phonemes can aid or alter phoneme categorization, providing cues for language learners and listeners to disambiguate perceptually similar sounds. Aim2 also examines how categorical neural representations are affected by temporal context. In addition to which phonemes occur in a sequence, speech processing also requires knowing where those elements occur. Sensitivities to the statistical regularities of speech sequences are established long before infants learn to speak, and continue to affect both recognition and comprehension throughout adulthood. Songbirds also attend to the statistical regularities in their vocal communication signals. In Aim 3, we focus on how sequence-specific information is encoded by single neurons and neural populations in auditory cortex. The proposed approach permits progress in the near term towards establishing the basic neurobiological substrates of foundational language-relevant abilities and a general framework within which more complex, uniquely human processes, can be proposed and eventually tested. Project Narrative: Normal speech comprehension and communication are rooted in basic auditory cognitive processes. Deficits in these processes accompany severe communication disorders (e.g. auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, specific language impairment, autism), and their abnormal function can compound the negative impacts of hearing impairments. The proposed project investigates the neuronal mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing using natural communication signals, with the ultimate goal of understanding the neurobiological basis of language-relevant abilities and improving treatment of communication processing disorders.",Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication,9803507,R01DC018055,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Sturnus vulgaris', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'bird song', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'pattern perception', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'specific language impairment', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'success']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,334599,0.010301328433105954
"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term aim of the proposed research is to provide an account of how children learn the grammatical structure of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input, and also how these learning mechanisms may differ from those of adult learners. Distributional information is the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences. We hypothesize that learners acquire aspects of language structure from the statistics arising from this distributional information, such as which elements co-occur, what positions they regularly occupy in a word or sentence, and with what neighboring elements they frequently occur. Our program of research to date has focused on word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) and on word categories (how learners determine which words form grammatical categories such as noun and verb). This work has documented the power and robustness of infants’, children’s, and adults’ ability to use complex distributional information to discover these aspects of language. We now propose to extend our research in new directions, to examine two crucial aspects of learning higher- level linguistic structure. In Part 1 we study the factors that lead learners to generalize a novel inflectional morpheme (like –s for noun plurals) to novel words. In Part 2 we examine how learners acquire phrases and simple hierarchical structure in sentences, and we ask what leads learners to prefer the types of phrase and hierarchical structures that are most common in natural languages.  In our proposed studies we test our hypotheses using miniature artificial language paradigms that afford control over the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using only data from natural language learning. In each experiment, participants listen to utterances in a miniature language and then produce their own utterances or make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during the learning phase they hear only a sample of the possible utterances that are legal in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test, to determine whether learners generalize what they have observed to novel instances (and if so, to which types of novel instances). We have developed highly successful paradigms for engaging young children in miniature language studies, and we have demonstrated important differences between child and adult language learners in these studies. We will also present children and adults with comparable learning paradigms in the visual-motor domain, to assess the time-course of the learning process and the specificity or generality of the results using auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies will document the key variables that enable a distributional learning mechanism to acquire the structure of words (inflectional morphology) and sentences (phrase and hierarchical structure) and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and stimulus domain. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The study of age effects in language acquisition can help to determine the timing of optimal language input for bilingual children, deaf children, and children with communicative disabilities. Our findings on statistical learning of words, word categories, morphology, and sentence structure are also highly relevant to understanding language disorders, and our paradigms are widely used for identifying and treating children with difficulties, delays, and disorders of language acquisition. As research in language acquisition has moved from measuring stages of acquisition to understanding the processes by which languages are learned, our proposed studies will make important contributions to understanding where these processes break down and how principles of statistical learning can be used for treatment and rehabilitation.",Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning,9607105,R01HD037082,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Elements', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Infant', 'Information Distribution', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'deaf', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'novel', 'phrases', 'programs', 'sound', 'statistics', 'virtual', 'visual motor', 'word learning']",NICHD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,580188,0.14862166781458205
"Identifying the neural structures and dynamics that regulate phonological structure The systematic patterning of language is a fundamental property of cognition. One aspect of this patterning, constraints on the combination of speech sounds to form words (phonotactic structure), has been implicated in constraining diverse processes related to language acquisition, perception, and production, bilingual language use, memory and even influences non-linguistic processes including the memorability of novel words and consumer reaction to novel brand names. This patterning changes in a variety of common acquired and developmental communication disorders. We will explore two explanations for these effects. One, developed in linguistic theory, argues that language users discover a set of abstract, language-specific rules or constraints that shape language use. The other view, developed in connectionist and dynamic systems theory, argues that phonotactic constraints emerge from top-down lexical influences on speech perception. Discriminating between these approaches is difficult because both explain behavioral data well. It is essential to discriminate between these accounts for two reasons. This question offers an excellent opportunity to resolve the debate over whether abstract linguistic rules/constraints create or simply describe the patterning of language. The resolution of this question has fundamental implications for the way linguistic formalism and connectionist simulations relate to human processing. At a more immediate level, this research offers the opportunity to identify a common core mechanism (either the leveraged use of abstract linguistic rules or top-down lexical influences) that explains and unites diverse linguistic and cognitive phenomena. Past efforts to resolve these issues have failed because of fundamental inferential limitations of behavioral and BOLD imaging paradigms. Accordingly, we have developed new tools and research strategies that allow us to identify patterns of directed interaction between brain regions (effective connectivity), and use these analyses to draw much stronger inferences about the dynamic processes that shape cognition. Observers in the field have argued that our methods have already provided “definitive” evidence to resolve the decades old debate over the role of top- down processes in speech processing. This proposal would extend those methods, and introduce innovative neural decoding analyses that we will use to characterize the categories (e.g. rules, words, abstract phonological representations needed to support rule application) that are encoded in localized brain activity. Using these methods, we will determine whether top-down lexical processes that we have shown produce phonotactic phenomena related to the processing of patterns that occur in speaker's language generalize to unfamiliar patterns. We will also use them to identify the substrates of rule- versus word-mediated processing, to provide a baseline for interpreted the representations and dynamic processes that support phonotactic effects in natural language processing. The human ability to learn and use language is the result of a complex set of dynamic brain processes that can break down as the result of disease, injury or developmental disorders. This work uses new non-invasive techniques to observe and understand some of the most fundamental brain processes that shape language learning and use so that we may better understand how they break down. This understanding should one day guide the development of better ways to treat diverse language disorders.",Identifying the neural structures and dynamics that regulate phonological structure,9674437,R01DC015455,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algebra', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Common Core', 'Communication impairment', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Structure', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'bilingualism', 'developmental disease', 'dynamic system', 'experience', 'innovation', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'phonology', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'speech processing', 'theories', 'tool', 'word learning']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,557010,0.09863726767297115
"Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders Improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, progress in testing these treatments is limited by the lack of informative outcome measures to indicate whether or not an intervention or treatment is having the desired effect on a child's conversational use of language (i.e., discourse skills). The long-term goal of the proposed renewal project is to harness the benefits of NLP to impact functional spoken language outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal of the parent R01 (R01DC012033) is to develop and validate new Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods that automatically measure discourse-related skills, including language productivity (talkativeness), grammar and vocabulary, and discourse, based on raw (i.e., not coded or annotated) transcripts of natural language samples. Our objective in this proposal is to take the next step to evaluate the suitability of these NLP-based measures as outcomes for children with a range of intellectual abilities, language levels, and diagnoses. NLP algorithms require choices of pivotal parameter settings, such as word frequency dependent weights. While our previous results, involving between-group contrasts, were insensitive to these settings, our proposed project, involving psychometric quantities such as validity, may be sensitive to them. Building on our progress from the parent R01, we propose to pursue three specific aims: (1) Identify pivotal parameter settings that optimize stability of NLP discourse measures, and examine responsiveness to real change; (2) Evaluate consistency of NLP discourse measures, and identify key measurement factors that impact consistency; and (3) Evaluate validity of NLP discourse measures, and differences in validity as a function of diagnostic group, age, IQ, and language ability. Our approach will focus on optimizing stability of such measures, and assessing responsiveness to change over time, consistency across sampling contexts and different sample lengths, and validity of each measure. The contribution of the proposed project will be to systematically assess the psychometric properties of NLP discourse measures. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by taking the crucial next step: the development of scalable, psychometrically sound measures of discourse skills that can be used to assess between-group differences as well as within-individual change over time. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to result in viable spoken language outcome measures for children with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, making it possible to target and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions. Ultimately, the successful completion of this study will provide the immediate ability to scale up treatment evaluations involving measurement of spoken language use, allowing flexible data collection across sites and studies, and in the future provide new targets for to-be-developed behavioral and pharmacological interventions. The proposed research is relevant to public health because improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and outcome measures that are automated, quantitative, scalable, and objective are needed to evaluate these treatments. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of NIH because it contributes to the development of fundamental knowledge about the spoken language use among children with a range of neurodevelopment disorders and conversational language difficulties, and will make it possible to target spoken language and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions.",Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders,9684602,R01DC012033,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stereotyping', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'common treatment', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'indexing', 'informant', 'innovation', 'language outcome', 'natural language', 'neurodevelopment', 'parent project', 'scale up', 'skills', 'sound', 'symptomatic improvement', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,608110,0.09361323263878728
"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",9753018,R01HD083312,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Chiroptera', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Felis catus', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'critical developmental period', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'indexing', 'language outcome', 'lexical', 'long term memory', 'natural language', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'sound', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2019,268205,0.17341881478910326
"Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder Project Summary/Abstract Currently, we lack an understanding of why grammatical deficits, particularly, are the primary deficit in developmental language disorder in children, and we also lack effective clinical treatment for these deficits. Recent studies have suggested that grammar may be impaired because of its statistical properties, which may be difficult for children with this disorder to learn or attend to. However, we do not yet understand what exactly about statistical input is difficult, and therefore face a gap in determining theoretical mechanisms that can explain the profile of developmental language disorder. In the proposed research, we explore the hypothesis that manipulations in the statistical properties of linguistic input may facilitate grammar learning in children with developmental language disorder. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims: We will compare learning for deterministic versus probabilistic statistical information to determine which type is more easily learned by children with developmental language disorder. We will compare learning for dependencies at different distributions to determine if children with developmental language disorder benefit from certain statistical structures. We will address these aims through two studies: an artificial grammar learning task and a sentence processing task with eye-tracking. These studies are innovative because they use tasks from basic research on language acquisition and processing to isolate aspects of linguistic input that could improve learning in developmental language disorder. Identifying the characteristics of linguistic information that are particularly problematic or relatively helpful for children with developmental language disorder as they learn grammar can help us understand where and how grammatical deficits in this population arise. Findings will be impactful because they may lead to more effective treatment through control of variables that can be simply managed in clinical settings, e.g. how often a word appears in one grammatical structure compared with another. The training provided in this proposal will provide theoretical and technical training in intervention research, working with individuals with developmental language disorder, and using real-time technologies to study language. Project Narrative Language development plays a critical role in a child’s ultimate academic and social success. A lack of effective treatment for the most prominent deficits in children with developmental language disorder represents a critical barrier to these children reaching their full potential as adults. By identifying and distinguishing the properties of language that are particularly effortful as well as those that are relatively easy for these children to learn, we can develop our understanding of learning in this disorder, and potentially make language treatment more effective.",Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder,9788034,F32DC017373,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Basic Science', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communication', 'Cues', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'clinically significant', 'design', 'educational atmosphere', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'farmer', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'peer', 'preservation', 'social', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,F32,2019,22217,0.10466260099294812
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs. Jan Edwards and Julie Washington, UW-Madison), toddlers with Williams Syndrome (with Drs. Carolyn Mervis and Cara Cashon, U. of Lousiville), and children with Cerebral Palsy (with Dr. Katie Hustad, UW-Madison).",Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition,9603758,R37HD037466,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Human Development', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Speech', 'Statistical Study', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Williams Syndrome', 'Work', 'base', 'deaf', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'knowledge of results', 'language processing', 'learning ability', 'named group', 'natural language', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R37,2019,340010,0.19580387163476706
"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. “Late Talkers” are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills.   Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse. The proposed studies evaluate treatment methods for vocabulary and morphosyntax deficits. The results should yield treatment procedures that can be imported into clinical practice.",Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children.,9729661,R01DC015642,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Back', 'Businesses', 'Child', 'Cleaved cell', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fathers', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Therapy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Nursery Schools', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Parents', 'Population', 'Preschool Child', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rice', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Special Education', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'density', 'design', 'dosage', 'economic outcome', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'learning outcome', 'literacy', 'peer', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'specific language impairment', 'success', 'synergism', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment optimization']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2019,606922,0.1131056769463663

Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders Abstract Language delay and impairments are common in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), as are sensory (including auditory) anomalies. Since acquisition of spoken language relies on the integrity of the auditory system, language delay and impairments may be related to sound processing abnormalities that are frequently observed in children with ASDs (despite normal peripheral hearing). However, it is not understood if and how early auditory brain anomalies may developmentally contribute to impaired language development.  This project will examine the maturation of auditory and language systems in the brain across early childhood, during the critical period for language acquisition. We will employ a longitudinal design and multimodal neuroimaging, including high-resolution anatomical, diffusion, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with added frequent and extensive behavioral and neuropsychological assessments. Our central hypothesis is that early disruptions to cortical sound processing precede and predict language impairments in ASDs and may thus be considered causal contributors – a hypothesis that has been frequently considered in the literature, but never tested at the neural level.  Our aims are to thoroughly characterize the structural integrity and functional differentiation of the cortical auditory and language systems (Aim 1) and their maturational trajectories (Aim 2) in toddlers with ASDs and age-matched typically developing peers. This will allow us to establish whether neural abnormalities in cortical processing of complex sounds in toddlers are predictive of language development and social behavior at the pre-school age (Aim 3). The rationale and translational significance of this project are that identification of alterations in brain development linked to language delay and impairment in the first years of life will allow for more targeted interventions in the auditory domain at a time when they are most effective. Project narrative The project aims to find causes of language impairment in children with autism spectrum disorders by studying the brain organization of the auditory system in toddlers at the very earliest age of provisional diagnosis. The overarching hypothesis is that atypical auditory processing contributes to language delay and impairment. Pinpointing auditory causes of language problems in children with ASDs may inform early interventions.",Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders,9716468,R01DC017736,"['Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Anisotropy', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early Intervention', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hearing', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Morphology', 'Neurites', 'Neuropsychology', 'Nursery Schools', 'Organizational Change', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Radial', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sensory', 'Sleep', 'Social Behavior', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TEP1 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'auditory processing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'critical period', 'density', 'early childhood', 'gray matter', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'molecular modeling', 'multimodality', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'peer', 'phonology', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sound', 'theories', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,619763,0.12099833340753743
"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9390046,R01DC013996,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American Sign Language', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow up assessment', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'language comprehension', 'language disorder diagnosis', 'phonology', 'psychiatric symptom', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'school district', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'social communication', 'specific language impairment', 'speech recognition', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,578454,0.1341935197792712
"An Individualized Vocabulary Intervention for Dual Language Learners Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this proposed project is to examine the feasibility of an individualized vocabulary intervention program for preschool dual language learners (DLL) from low socioeconomic (SES) backgrounds. Children who grow up in low SES and language minority homes (L1) and learn English (L2) as a second language in school settings are likely to be at risk for reading difficulties and poor academic performance (e.g., August et al., 2006). In order to serve the particular needs of DLLs from diverse backgrounds, scientific evidence is critically needed about the intervention strategies for these preschoolers. In this proposed study, we examine the feasibility of using machine learning methods to generate individually tailored interventions for low SES dual language learners who learn two typologically different languages, Cantonese (L1) and English (L2). Two important strategies will be used in this study. First, a computation model will be built to predict and select appropriate bilingual target words for individual DLLs. Second, this intervention will be integrated into the extant preschool curriculum, thus resulting in a potentially sustainable, scalable approach to decreasing language proficiency gaps. There are two specific aims in this proposed study: 1. Model normative lexical development in Cantonese-English DLLs. We will leverage  data previously collected by Dr. Kan on Cantonese-English vocabulary development at  Head Start Centers, and computational models of typical lexical development in monolingual  English speakers, to build a computational model of typical bilingual lexical development in  Cantonese-English dual language learners. 2. Evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a model-based individualized vocabulary  intervention program. We will use the computational model to make individual level target  word recommendations for 200 Cantonese-English DLLs, and work with teachers at 8 Head  Start centers to integrate the recommendations into their existing curriculum. The goal of this project is to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of using machine learning methods to develop an individualized, personalized vocabulary intervention programs for preschool dual language learners from low socioeconomic backgrounds.

"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment (PLI) emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, identification in toddlers is not currently possible because of the high rate of false positives reflecting transient language delays. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, neurodevelopmental approach to generate earlier, more accurate identification of toddler risk for persistent PLI via: (a) multi-faceted, longitudinal assessment of toddler emergent language patterns; (b) detailed consideration of the transactional language environment; and (c) accounting for emergent health risk in predictive models. Earlier, reliable identification of toddlers at highest risk for PLI will optimize early intervention to prevent developmentally- cascading effects.",The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment,9522332,R01DC016273,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'model building', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'standard measure', 'translational approach']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,666236,0.13198555827704725
"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,9612777,R13DC017375,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Aphasia', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Governing Board', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hour', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speech Perception', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Travel', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career networking', 'experience', 'frontier', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'semantic processing', 'success', 'symposium', 'syntax', 'tenure track', 'web site']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2018,39939,0.05918370163335296
"Identifying the neural structures and dynamics that regulate phonological structure The systematic patterning of language is a fundamental property of cognition. One aspect of this patterning, constraints on the combination of speech sounds to form words (phonotactic structure), has been implicated in constraining diverse processes related to language acquisition, perception, and production, bilingual language use, memory and even influences non-linguistic processes including the memorability of novel words and consumer reaction to novel brand names. This patterning changes in a variety of common acquired and developmental communication disorders. We will explore two explanations for these effects. One, developed in linguistic theory, argues that language users discover a set of abstract, language-specific rules or constraints that shape language use. The other view, developed in connectionist and dynamic systems theory, argues that phonotactic constraints emerge from top-down lexical influences on speech perception. Discriminating between these approaches is difficult because both explain behavioral data well. It is essential to discriminate between these accounts for two reasons. This question offers an excellent opportunity to resolve the debate over whether abstract linguistic rules/constraints create or simply describe the patterning of language. The resolution of this question has fundamental implications for the way linguistic formalism and connectionist simulations relate to human processing. At a more immediate level, this research offers the opportunity to identify a common core mechanism (either the leveraged use of abstract linguistic rules or top-down lexical influences) that explains and unites diverse linguistic and cognitive phenomena. Past efforts to resolve these issues have failed because of fundamental inferential limitations of behavioral and BOLD imaging paradigms. Accordingly, we have developed new tools and research strategies that allow us to identify patterns of directed interaction between brain regions (effective connectivity), and use these analyses to draw much stronger inferences about the dynamic processes that shape cognition. Observers in the field have argued that our methods have already provided “definitive” evidence to resolve the decades old debate over the role of top- down processes in speech processing. This proposal would extend those methods, and introduce innovative neural decoding analyses that we will use to characterize the categories (e.g. rules, words, abstract phonological representations needed to support rule application) that are encoded in localized brain activity. Using these methods, we will determine whether top-down lexical processes that we have shown produce phonotactic phenomena related to the processing of patterns that occur in speaker's language generalize to unfamiliar patterns. We will also use them to identify the substrates of rule- versus word-mediated processing, to provide a baseline for interpreted the representations and dynamic processes that support phonotactic effects in natural language processing. The human ability to learn and use language is the result of a complex set of dynamic brain processes that can break down as the result of disease, injury or developmental disorders. This work uses new non-invasive techniques to observe and understand some of the most fundamental brain processes that shape language learning and use so that we may better understand how they break down. This understanding should one day guide the development of better ways to treat diverse language disorders.",Identifying the neural structures and dynamics that regulate phonological structure,9461502,R01DC015455,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algebra', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Common Core', 'Communication impairment', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Structure', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'bilingualism', 'developmental disease', 'dynamic system', 'experience', 'innovation', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'phonology', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'speech processing', 'theories', 'tool', 'word learning']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,607626,0.09863726767297115
"Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders Improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, progress in testing these treatments is limited by the lack of informative outcome measures to indicate whether or not an intervention or treatment is having the desired effect on a child's conversational use of language (i.e., discourse skills). The long-term goal of the proposed renewal project is to harness the benefits of NLP to impact functional spoken language outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal of the parent R01 (R01DC012033) is to develop and validate new Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods that automatically measure discourse-related skills, including language productivity (talkativeness), grammar and vocabulary, and discourse, based on raw (i.e., not coded or annotated) transcripts of natural language samples. Our objective in this proposal is to take the next step to evaluate the suitability of these NLP-based measures as outcomes for children with a range of intellectual abilities, language levels, and diagnoses. NLP algorithms require choices of pivotal parameter settings, such as word frequency dependent weights. While our previous results, involving between-group contrasts, were insensitive to these settings, our proposed project, involving psychometric quantities such as validity, may be sensitive to them. Building on our progress from the parent R01, we propose to pursue three specific aims: (1) Identify pivotal parameter settings that optimize stability of NLP discourse measures, and examine responsiveness to real change; (2) Evaluate consistency of NLP discourse measures, and identify key measurement factors that impact consistency; and (3) Evaluate validity of NLP discourse measures, and differences in validity as a function of diagnostic group, age, IQ, and language ability. Our approach will focus on optimizing stability of such measures, and assessing responsiveness to change over time, consistency across sampling contexts and different sample lengths, and validity of each measure. The contribution of the proposed project will be to systematically assess the psychometric properties of NLP discourse measures. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by taking the crucial next step: the development of scalable, psychometrically sound measures of discourse skills that can be used to assess between-group differences as well as within-individual change over time. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to result in viable spoken language outcome measures for children with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, making it possible to target and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions. Ultimately, the successful completion of this study will provide the immediate ability to scale up treatment evaluations involving measurement of spoken language use, allowing flexible data collection across sites and studies, and in the future provide new targets for to-be-developed behavioral and pharmacological interventions. The proposed research is relevant to public health because improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and outcome measures that are automated, quantitative, scalable, and objective are needed to evaluate these treatments. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of NIH because it contributes to the development of fundamental knowledge about the spoken language use among children with a range of neurodevelopment disorders and conversational language difficulties, and will make it possible to target spoken language and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions.",Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders,9470863,R01DC012033,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stereotyping', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'common treatment', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'indexing', 'informant', 'innovation', 'natural language', 'neurodevelopment', 'parent project', 'scale up', 'skills', 'sound', 'symptomatic improvement', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,606853,0.09361323263878728
"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term aim of the proposed research is to provide an account of how children learn the grammatical structure of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input, and also how these learning mechanisms may differ from those of adult learners. Distributional information is the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences. We hypothesize that learners acquire aspects of language structure from the statistics arising from this distributional information, such as which elements co-occur, what positions they regularly occupy in a word or sentence, and with what neighboring elements they frequently occur. Our program of research to date has focused on word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) and on word categories (how learners determine which words form grammatical categories such as noun and verb). This work has documented the power and robustness of infants’, children’s, and adults’ ability to use complex distributional information to discover these aspects of language. We now propose to extend our research in new directions, to examine two crucial aspects of learning higher- level linguistic structure. In Part 1 we study the factors that lead learners to generalize a novel inflectional morpheme (like –s for noun plurals) to novel words. In Part 2 we examine how learners acquire phrases and simple hierarchical structure in sentences, and we ask what leads learners to prefer the types of phrase and hierarchical structures that are most common in natural languages.  In our proposed studies we test our hypotheses using miniature artificial language paradigms that afford control over the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using only data from natural language learning. In each experiment, participants listen to utterances in a miniature language and then produce their own utterances or make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during the learning phase they hear only a sample of the possible utterances that are legal in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test, to determine whether learners generalize what they have observed to novel instances (and if so, to which types of novel instances). We have developed highly successful paradigms for engaging young children in miniature language studies, and we have demonstrated important differences between child and adult language learners in these studies. We will also present children and adults with comparable learning paradigms in the visual-motor domain, to assess the time-course of the learning process and the specificity or generality of the results using auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies will document the key variables that enable a distributional learning mechanism to acquire the structure of words (inflectional morphology) and sentences (phrase and hierarchical structure) and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and stimulus domain. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The study of age effects in language acquisition can help to determine the timing of optimal language input for bilingual children, deaf children, and children with communicative disabilities. Our findings on statistical learning of words, word categories, morphology, and sentence structure are also highly relevant to understanding language disorders, and our paradigms are widely used for identifying and treating children with difficulties, delays, and disorders of language acquisition. As research in language acquisition has moved from measuring stages of acquisition to understanding the processes by which languages are learned, our proposed studies will make important contributions to understanding where these processes break down and how principles of statistical learning can be used for treatment and rehabilitation.",Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning,9471944,R01HD037082,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Elements', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Infant', 'Information Distribution', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'novel', 'phrases', 'programs', 'sound', 'statistics', 'virtual', 'visual motor', 'word learning']",NICHD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,594063,0.14862166781458205
"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",9533881,R01HD083312,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Chiroptera', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Felis catus', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'critical developmental period', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'indexing', 'lexical', 'long term memory', 'natural language', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'sound', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2018,266324,0.17341881478910326
"Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder Project Summary/Abstract Currently, we lack an understanding of why grammatical deficits, particularly, are the primary deficit in developmental language disorder in children, and we also lack effective clinical treatment for these deficits. Recent studies have suggested that grammar may be impaired because of its statistical properties, which may be difficult for children with this disorder to learn or attend to. However, we do not yet understand what exactly about statistical input is difficult, and therefore face a gap in determining theoretical mechanisms that can explain the profile of developmental language disorder. In the proposed research, we explore the hypothesis that manipulations in the statistical properties of linguistic input may facilitate grammar learning in children with developmental language disorder. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims: We will compare learning for deterministic versus probabilistic statistical information to determine which type is more easily learned by children with developmental language disorder. We will compare learning for dependencies at different distributions to determine if children with developmental language disorder benefit from certain statistical structures. We will address these aims through two studies: an artificial grammar learning task and a sentence processing task with eye-tracking. These studies are innovative because they use tasks from basic research on language acquisition and processing to isolate aspects of linguistic input that could improve learning in developmental language disorder. Identifying the characteristics of linguistic information that are particularly problematic or relatively helpful for children with developmental language disorder as they learn grammar can help us understand where and how grammatical deficits in this population arise. Findings will be impactful because they may lead to more effective treatment through control of variables that can be simply managed in clinical settings, e.g. how often a word appears in one grammatical structure compared with another. The training provided in this proposal will provide theoretical and technical training in intervention research, working with individuals with developmental language disorder, and using real-time technologies to study language. Project Narrative Language development plays a critical role in a child’s ultimate academic and social success. A lack of effective treatment for the most prominent deficits in children with developmental language disorder represents a critical barrier to these children reaching their full potential as adults. By identifying and distinguishing the properties of language that are particularly effortful as well as those that are relatively easy for these children to learn, we can develop our understanding of learning in this disorder, and potentially make language treatment more effective.",Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder,9609288,F32DC017373,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Basic Science', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communication', 'Cues', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'clinically significant', 'design', 'educational atmosphere', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'farmer', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'peer', 'social', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,F32,2018,58282,0.10466260099294812
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs. Jan Edwards and Julie Washington, UW-Madison), toddlers with Williams Syndrome (with Drs. Carolyn Mervis and Cara Cashon, U. of Lousiville), and children with Cerebral Palsy (with Dr. Katie Hustad, UW-Madison).",Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition,9379468,R37HD037466,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Human Development', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Speech', 'Statistical Study', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Williams Syndrome', 'Work', 'base', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'knowledge of results', 'language processing', 'named group', 'natural language', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R37,2018,340010,0.19580387163476706
"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. “Late Talkers” are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills.   Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse. The proposed studies evaluate treatment methods for vocabulary and morphosyntax deficits. The results should yield treatment procedures that can be imported into clinical practice.",Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children.,9506574,R01DC015642,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Back', 'Businesses', 'Child', 'Cleaved cell', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fathers', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Therapy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Nursery Schools', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Parents', 'Population', 'Preschool Child', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rice', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Special Education', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'density', 'design', 'dosage', 'economic outcome', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'learning outcome', 'literacy', 'peer', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'specific language impairment', 'success', 'synergism', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment optimization']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2018,606922,0.1131056769463663
"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9191358,R01DC013996,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American Sign Language', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow up assessment', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'language comprehension', 'language disorder diagnosis', 'phonology', 'psychiatric symptom', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'school district', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'social communication', 'specific language impairment', 'speech recognition', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,602469,0.1341935197792712
"Identifying the neural structures and dynamics that regulate phonological structure The systematic patterning of language is a fundamental property of cognition. One aspect of this patterning, constraints on the combination of speech sounds to form words (phonotactic structure), has been implicated in constraining diverse processes related to language acquisition, perception, and production, bilingual language use, memory and even influences non-linguistic processes including the memorability of novel words and consumer reaction to novel brand names. This patterning changes in a variety of common acquired and developmental communication disorders. We will explore two explanations for these effects. One, developed in linguistic theory, argues that language users discover a set of abstract, language-specific rules or constraints that shape language use. The other view, developed in connectionist and dynamic systems theory, argues that phonotactic constraints emerge from top-down lexical influences on speech perception. Discriminating between these approaches is difficult because both explain behavioral data well. It is essential to discriminate between these accounts for two reasons. This question offers an excellent opportunity to resolve the debate over whether abstract linguistic rules/constraints create or simply describe the patterning of language. The resolution of this question has fundamental implications for the way linguistic formalism and connectionist simulations relate to human processing. At a more immediate level, this research offers the opportunity to identify a common core mechanism (either the leveraged use of abstract linguistic rules or top-down lexical influences) that explains and unites diverse linguistic and cognitive phenomena. Past efforts to resolve these issues have failed because of fundamental inferential limitations of behavioral and BOLD imaging paradigms. Accordingly, we have developed new tools and research strategies that allow us to identify patterns of directed interaction between brain regions (effective connectivity), and use these analyses to draw much stronger inferences about the dynamic processes that shape cognition. Observers in the field have argued that our methods have already provided “definitive” evidence to resolve the decades old debate over the role of top- down processes in speech processing. This proposal would extend those methods, and introduce innovative neural decoding analyses that we will use to characterize the categories (e.g. rules, words, abstract phonological representations needed to support rule application) that are encoded in localized brain activity. Using these methods, we will determine whether top-down lexical processes that we have shown produce phonotactic phenomena related to the processing of patterns that occur in speaker's language generalize to unfamiliar patterns. We will also use them to identify the substrates of rule- versus word-mediated processing, to provide a baseline for interpreted the representations and dynamic processes that support phonotactic effects in natural language processing. The human ability to learn and use language is the result of a complex set of dynamic brain processes that can break down as the result of disease, injury or developmental disorders. This work uses new non-invasive techniques to observe and understand some of the most fundamental brain processes that shape language learning and use so that we may better understand how they break down.

"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",9313700,R01HD083312,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Chiroptera', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Felis catus', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'critical developmental period', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'indexing', 'lexical', 'long term memory', 'natural language', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'sound', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2017,267749,0.17341881478910326
"Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders Improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, progress in testing these treatments is limited by the lack of informative outcome measures to indicate whether or not an intervention or treatment is having the desired effect on a child's conversational use of language (i.e., discourse skills). The long-term goal of the proposed renewal project is to harness the benefits of NLP to impact functional spoken language outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal of the parent R01 (R01DC012033) is to develop and validate new Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods that automatically measure discourse-related skills, including language productivity (talkativeness), grammar and vocabulary, and discourse, based on raw (i.e., not coded or annotated) transcripts of natural language samples. Our objective in this proposal is to take the next step to evaluate the suitability of these NLP-based measures as outcomes for children with a range of intellectual abilities, language levels, and diagnoses. NLP algorithms require choices of pivotal parameter settings, such as word frequency dependent weights. While our previous results, involving between-group contrasts, were insensitive to these settings, our proposed project, involving psychometric quantities such as validity, may be sensitive to them. Building on our progress from the parent R01, we propose to pursue three specific aims: (1) Identify pivotal parameter settings that optimize stability of NLP discourse measures, and examine responsiveness to real change; (2) Evaluate consistency of NLP discourse measures, and identify key measurement factors that impact consistency; and (3) Evaluate validity of NLP discourse measures, and differences in validity as a function of diagnostic group, age, IQ, and language ability. Our approach will focus on optimizing stability of such measures, and assessing responsiveness to change over time, consistency across sampling contexts and different sample lengths, and validity of each measure. The contribution of the proposed project will be to systematically assess the psychometric properties of NLP discourse measures. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by taking the crucial next step: the development of scalable, psychometrically sound measures of discourse skills that can be used to assess between-group differences as well as within-individual change over time. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to result in viable spoken language outcome measures for children with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, making it possible to target and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions. Ultimately, the successful completion of this study will provide the immediate ability to scale up treatment evaluations involving measurement of spoken language use, allowing flexible data collection across sites and studies, and in the future provide new targets for to-be-developed behavioral and pharmacological interventions. The proposed research is relevant to public health because improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and outcome measures that are automated, quantitative, scalable, and objective are needed to evaluate these treatments. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of NIH because it contributes to the development of fundamental knowledge about the spoken language use among children with a range of neurodevelopment disorders and conversational language difficulties, and will make it possible to target spoken language and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions.",Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders,9307257,R01DC012033,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stereotyping', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'common treatment', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'indexing', 'informant', 'innovation', 'natural language', 'neurodevelopment', 'parent project', 'scale up', 'skills', 'sound', 'symptomatic improvement', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,636163,0.09361323263878728
"Distributional Learning in Children with Language Impairment Project Summary/Abstract Statistical learning experiments have demonstrated that children and infants are sensitive to the types of statistical regularities found in natural language. These experiments often rely on statistical information based on linear dependencies, e.g. that x predicts y either immediately or after some intervening items, whereas learning to creatively use language relies on the ability to form grammatical categories (e.g. verbs, nouns) that share distributions. Distributional learning has not been explored in children or individuals with language impairment. The proposed research can reveal new findings regarding language acquisition and use in these populations. Proposed statistical learning deficits in individuals with language impairment (LI) are thought to have downstream effects causing poorer comprehension, but this relationship has not been experimentally shown. In this project, children with and without LI and their typically developing (TD) peers will complete an online comprehension task that employs natural language and an artificial grammar learning task that employs a made-up language. In the online comprehension task, participants use a computer mouse to choose a preferred interpretation of a sentence that is ambiguous, but that most adults would interpret a certain way due to the distributional properties of the verb, an effect termed verb bias. It has not been shown whether individuals LI are sensitive to verb bias effects, but we predict children with LI will be less sensitive than peers on the basis of previous work showing deficits with verb use and overall poorer linguistic experience in this population. In the artificial grammar learning task, participants will be tested to determine if they have learned the statistical regularities of trained stimuli and formed categories based upon these regularities. We predict TD participants will form more robust categories. It has not been shown whether individuals with LI are worse at utilizing distributional information from novel input, but poor performance on other statistical learning tasks by this population suggests a deficit. We will use measurements from both tasks to verify a relationship between them, for the additional goal of showing that language comprehension and statistical learning are related. This study will provide information about differences between children with LI and their TD peers in the ability to use distributional information from both accumulated and novel input. To this end, we will discover the role of input and experience in using distributional information in linguistic environments. Project Narrative The proposed project will provide information about the extent to which children with and without language impairment utilize distributional information in the input, specifically as regards to language. Problems with language learning are correlated with long-term academic and social difficulties, and a better understanding of how statistical information like words’ distribution is processed and utilized by individuals with language impairment can shed insight into the role of the input in language learning and use. This information could lead to intervention techniques that manipulate distributional information in order to facilitate language development and improve comprehension in children with language impairment.",Distributional Learning in Children with Language Impairment,9352674,F31DC015370,"['Adult', 'Categories', 'Cereals', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Information Distribution', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nursery Schools', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'comprehension deficit', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'farmer', 'improved', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'language impairment', 'natural language', 'novel', 'peer', 'social', 'sound', 'syntax', 'teacher', 'therapy design']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,F31,2017,24909,0.1426389330516313
"""Mechanisms of Early Bilingual Language Acquisition"" ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A majority of children worldwide learn more than one language (Grosjean, 2010), yet theories of language acquisition treat monolingualism as the standard learning model. Bilingualism is highly common, but the mechanisms that drive bilingual learning are not yet well understood. In order to develop rich theories of language acquisition, it is necessary to include a full consideration of the demands of bilingual learning environments and how learners cope with these demands.  The proposed research project seeks to fill this theoretical gap by investigating bilingual statistical learning at the very early stages of languag acquisition. Statistical learning entails discovering structure by tracking patterns that are preset in the input. Statistical learning is a popular framework that has received a great deal of attention for its potential to explain how infants and children acquire many dimensions of linguistic structure. Infants are remarkably skilled at tracking regularities. However, the literatre has not yet addressed how bilingualism affects the ability to extract statistical regularities in linguistic input. The demands are substantially greater for bilinguals than for monolinguals. They must track two separate sets of regularities for every aspect of linguistic structure, from sounds to words to grammar. This research will examine two processes that are fundamental for early language acquisition, the ability to detect words in fluent speech and the ability to associate word forms with meanings. The experiments will address how dual language input affects infants' ability to perform these tasks. In addition, both monolingual and bilingual infants will participate, providing a window on how bilingual experience affects infants' tracking of regularities in dual languages. The project will also explore what cognitive processes support bilingual infants' ability to learn effectively in two immensely complex linguistic systems, focusig on how cognitive control and vocabulary composition relate to statistical learning skills in the laboratory.  In addressing a theoretical gap, the proposed research also has substantial significance for public health. This work will reveal mechanisms that infants use to learn and the conditions that support or hinder bilingual learning. These contributions have potential to affect the design and implementation of early bilingual education programs. In addition, this work will elucidate the mechanisms that typically developing infants use to acquire language, which has applied value for the study of language impairments. Understanding the underlying processes of typical development is crucial for understanding the development of populations who are not acquiring language on a typical course. It is important to know how learning typically proceeds in order to identify potential underlying deficits in learning impairments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A majority of children worldwide are bilingual, yet there is limited understanding of how bilinguals learn. This work addresses a crucial gap in accounts of language acquisition and will inform programs for bilingual education. In addition, the research will support the search for underlying deficits in children with language impairments by characterizing the mechanisms that drive typical development.","""Mechanisms of Early Bilingual Language Acquisition""",9242682,R03HD084941,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Attention', 'Child', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Information Distribution', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Shapes', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'design', 'developmental psychology', 'educational atmosphere', 'executive function', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'heuristics', 'infancy', 'language impairment', 'novel', 'phonology', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sound', 'syntax', 'theories', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2017,78500,0.16696907888194462
"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. “Late Talkers” are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills.   Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse. The proposed studies evaluate treatment methods for vocabulary and morphosyntax deficits. The results should yield treatment procedures that can be imported into clinical practice.",Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children.,9297279,R01DC015642,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Back', 'Businesses', 'Child', 'Cleaved cell', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fathers', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Therapy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Nursery Schools', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Parents', 'Population', 'Preschool Child', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rice', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Special Education', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'density', 'design', 'dosage', 'economic outcome', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'learning outcome', 'literacy', 'peer', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'specific language impairment', 'success', 'synergism', 'theories', 'treatment effect']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2017,606922,0.1131056769463663
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs. Jan Edwards and Julie Washington, UW-Madison), toddlers with Williams Syndrome (with Drs. Carolyn Mervis and Cara Cashon, U. of Lousiville), and children with Cerebral Palsy (with Dr. Katie Hustad, UW-Madison).",Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition,9178665,R37HD037466,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Human Development', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Speech', 'Statistical Study', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Williams Syndrome', 'Work', 'base', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'knowledge of results', 'language processing', 'named group', 'natural language', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R37,2017,340010,0.19580387163476706
"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"Neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern perception Project Summary/Abstract: Processing acoustic communication signals is among the most difficult, yet vital capabilities that the auditory system must achieve. These abilities lie at the heart of language and speech processing, and their success or failure can have profound impacts on quality of life across the lifespan. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that support these basic abilities holds promise for advancing assistive listening devices, as well as improving diagnoses and treatments for learning disabilities and communication disorders such as auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, and specific language impairment. While much has been learned about the loci of language-related processing using non-invasive neuroscience techniques in humans, these techniques cannot answer how individual neurons and neural circuits implement language-relevant computations. As a result, the explicit cellular circuit-level and neuro-computational mechanisms that support acoustic communication signal processing are poorly understood. Multiple lines of research suggest that songbirds can provide an excellent model for investigating shared auditory processing abilities relevant to language, in particular the processing of temporal patterns within communication signals. The experiments outlined in this proposal investigate the neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing. In humans, the transition statistics between adjacent speech sounds (phonemes) can aid or alter phoneme categorization, providing cues for language learners and listeners to disambiguate perceptually similar sounds. Sensitivity to transition statistics is not exclusive to speech signals however, but reflects general auditory processes shared by many animals. In Aim 1 we investigate the categorical perception of complex auditory objects in populations of cortical neurons in an animal model, and ask how these neural representations are effected by temporal context. In addition to which elements occur in a sequence, speech processing also requires knowing where those elements occur. Sensitivities to the statistical regularities of speech sequences are established long before infants learn to speak, and continue to affect both recognition and comprehension throughout adulthood. Studies in Aim 2 focus on how sequence-specific information is encoded by single neurons and neural populations in auditory cortex. In Aim 3, we propose a basic circuit in which population level representations of auditory objects could be differentially modulated by patterning rules, and test this proposed pattern processing circuit using direct, casual manipulations. The proposed approach permits progress in the near term towards establishing the basic neurobiological substrates of foundational language-relevant abilities and a general framework within which more complex, uniquely human processes, can be proposed and eventually tested. Project Narrative: Normal speech comprehension and communication are rooted in basic auditory cognitive processes. Deficits in these processes accompany severe communication disorders (e.g. auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, specific language impairment, autism), and their abnormal function can compound the negative impacts of hearing impairments. The proposed project investigates the neuronal mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing using natural communication signals, with the ultimate goal of understanding the neurobiological basis of language-relevant abilities and improving treatment of communication processing disorders.",Neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern perception,9527903,R56DC016408,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Birds', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Technique', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Role', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Sturnus vulgaris', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transition Elements', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'bird song', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'language processing', 'microstimulation', 'model development', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'pattern perception', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'specific language impairment', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'success']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R56,2017,363607,-0.011696573317801625
"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.                ",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9020029,R01DC013996,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Only Child', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Sign Language', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'Writing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'language comprehension', 'language disorder diagnosis', 'phonology', 'psychiatric symptom', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'school district', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'social communication', 'specific language impairment', 'speech recognition', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,638494,0.1341935197792712
"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",9116242,R01HD083312,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Chiroptera', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Felis catus', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phonetics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'coping', 'critical developmental period', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'lexical', 'long term memory', 'natural language', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'resilience', 'sound', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2016,263788,0.17341881478910326
"""Mechanisms of Early Bilingual Language Acquisition"" ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A majority of children worldwide learn more than one language (Grosjean, 2010), yet theories of language acquisition treat monolingualism as the standard learning model. Bilingualism is highly common, but the mechanisms that drive bilingual learning are not yet well understood. In order to develop rich theories of language acquisition, it is necessary to include a full consideration of the demands of bilingual learning environments and how learners cope with these demands.  The proposed research project seeks to fill this theoretical gap by investigating bilingual statistical learning at the very early stages of languag acquisition. Statistical learning entails discovering structure by tracking patterns that are preset in the input. Statistical learning is a popular framework that has received a great deal of attention for its potential to explain how infants and children acquire many dimensions of linguistic structure. Infants are remarkably skilled at tracking regularities. However, the literatre has not yet addressed how bilingualism affects the ability to extract statistical regularities in linguistic input. The demands are substantially greater for bilinguals than for monolinguals. They must track two separate sets of regularities for every aspect of linguistic structure, from sounds to words to grammar. This research will examine two processes that are fundamental for early language acquisition, the ability to detect words in fluent speech and the ability to associate word forms with meanings. The experiments will address how dual language input affects infants' ability to perform these tasks. In addition, both monolingual and bilingual infants will participate, providing a window on how bilingual experience affects infants' tracking of regularities in dual languages. The project will also explore what cognitive processes support bilingual infants' ability to learn effectively in two immensely complex linguistic systems, focusig on how cognitive control and vocabulary composition relate to statistical learning skills in the laboratory.  In addressing a theoretical gap, the proposed research also has substantial significance for public health. This work will reveal mechanisms that infants use to learn and the conditions that support or hinder bilingual learning. These contributions have potential to affect the design and implementation of early bilingual education programs. In addition, this work will elucidate the mechanisms that typically developing infants use to acquire language, which has applied value for the study of language impairments. Understanding the underlying processes of typical development is crucial for understanding the development of populations who are not acquiring language on a typical course. It is important to know how learning typically proceeds in order to identify potential underlying deficits in learning impairments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A majority of children worldwide are bilingual, yet there is limited understanding of how bilinguals learn. This work addresses a crucial gap in accounts of language acquisition and will inform programs for bilingual education. In addition, the research will support the search for underlying deficits in children with language impairments by characterizing the mechanisms that drive typical development.        ","""Mechanisms of Early Bilingual Language Acquisition""",9112198,R03HD084941,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Attention', 'Child', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Shapes', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'coping', 'design', 'developmental psychology', 'educational atmosphere', 'executive function', 'experience', 'heuristics', 'infancy', 'language impairment', 'novel', 'phonology', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'sound', 'syntax', 'theories', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2016,78438,0.16696907888194462
"Distributional Learning in Children with Language Impairment Project Summary/Abstract Statistical learning experiments have demonstrated that children and infants are sensitive to the types of statistical regularities found in natural language. These experiments often rely on statistical information based on linear dependencies, e.g. that x predicts y either immediately or after some intervening items, whereas learning to creatively use language relies on the ability to form grammatical categories (e.g. verbs, nouns) that share distributions. Distributional learning has not been explored in children or individuals with language impairment. The proposed research can reveal new findings regarding language acquisition and use in these populations. Proposed statistical learning deficits in individuals with language impairment (LI) are thought to have downstream effects causing poorer comprehension, but this relationship has not been experimentally shown. In this project, children with and without LI and their typically developing (TD) peers will complete an online comprehension task that employs natural language and an artificial grammar learning task that employs a made-up language. In the online comprehension task, participants use a computer mouse to choose a preferred interpretation of a sentence that is ambiguous, but that most adults would interpret a certain way due to the distributional properties of the verb, an effect termed verb bias. It has not been shown whether individuals LI are sensitive to verb bias effects, but we predict children with LI will be less sensitive than peers on the basis of previous work showing deficits with verb use and overall poorer linguistic experience in this population. In the artificial grammar learning task, participants will be tested to determine if they have learned the statistical regularities of trained stimuli and formed categories based upon these regularities. We predict TD participants will form more robust categories. It has not been shown whether individuals with LI are worse at utilizing distributional information from novel input, but poor performance on other statistical learning tasks by this population suggests a deficit. We will use measurements from both tasks to verify a relationship between them, for the additional goal of showing that language comprehension and statistical learning are related. This study will provide information about differences between children with LI and their TD peers in the ability to use distributional information from both accumulated and novel input. To this end, we will discover the role of input and experience in using distributional information in linguistic environments. Project Narrative The proposed project will provide information about the extent to which children with and without language impairment utilize distributional information in the input, specifically as regards to language. Problems with language learning are correlated with long-term academic and social difficulties, and a better understanding of how statistical information like words’ distribution is processed and utilized by individuals with language impairment can shed insight into the role of the input in language learning and use. This information could lead to intervention techniques that manipulate distributional information in order to facilitate language development and improve comprehension in children with language impairment.",Distributional Learning in Children with Language Impairment,9255906,F31DC015370,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Categories', 'Cereals', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nursery Schools', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'comprehension deficit', 'experience', 'farmer', 'improved', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'language impairment', 'natural language', 'novel', 'peer', 'research study', 'social', 'sound', 'syntax', 'teacher', 'therapy design']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,F31,2016,31612,0.1426389330516313
"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. “Late Talkers” are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills.   Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse. The proposed studies evaluate treatment methods for vocabulary and morphosyntax deficits. The results should yield treatment procedures that can be imported into clinical practice.",Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children.,9172394,R01DC015642,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Back', 'Businesses', 'Child', 'Cleaved cell', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fathers', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Therapy', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Nursery Schools', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Parents', 'Population', 'Preschool Child', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rice', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Special Education', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'density', 'design', 'dosage', 'economic outcome', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'learning outcome', 'literacy', 'peer', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'specific language impairment', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment effect']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2016,606922,0.1131056769463663
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs. Jan Edwards and Julie Washington, UW-Madison), toddlers with Williams Syndrome (with Drs. Carolyn Mervis and Cara Cashon, U. of Lousiville), and children with Cerebral Palsy (with Dr. Katie Hustad, UW-Madison).",Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition,8976620,R37HD037466,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Health', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Human Development', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Williams Syndrome', 'Work', 'base', 'expectation', 'experience', 'innovation', 'knowledge of results', 'language processing', 'named group', 'natural language', 'programs', 'research study', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R37,2016,336609,0.19580387163476706
"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment. The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. By exploring how differences in language characteristics, in conjunction with neurocognitive individual differences, shape the trajectory of acquiring literacy skills in a new language and how those skills, in turn, impact native language performance, this proposed research aims to provide new understanding of challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and language environment.",Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development,8852664,R01HD067364,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Assimilations', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'English Learner', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Writing', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'bilingualism', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning ability', 'literacy', 'longitudinal design', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'phonology', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories']",NICHD,"HASKINS LABORATORIES, INC.",R01,2015,576358,0.1551748502196521
"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.            ","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",8984582,R01HD083312,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Chiroptera', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Felis catus', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phonetics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'coping', 'critical developmental period', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'lexical', 'long term memory', 'natural language', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'resilience', 'sound', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2015,241243,0.17341881478910326
"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.","Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys",8851635,R01HD067250,"['Adult', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Benchmarking', 'British', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infant', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufactured football', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phonetics', 'Procedures', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Rivers', 'Role', 'Saguinus', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soccer', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Voice', 'Work', 'auditory stimulus', 'bilingualism', 'design', 'lexical', 'man', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'phonology', 'preference', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2015,208800,0.09216585215863742
"Statistical learning, memory systems, and sleep-based memory consolidation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The acquisition of language is essential for normal functioning, and problems with language acquisition can severely limit an individual's educational, career, and social opportunities. One mechanism thought to play a critical role in language acquisition is statistical learning, which refers to the process of extracting subtle patterns from environmental input. Although it is commonly assumed that statistical learning operates implicitly, without requiring conscious effort or awareness, this fundamental assumption has not been directly tested. It is possible that inducing statistical learning to occur explicitly rather than implicitly may engage additional explicit memory systems and may also facilitate sleep-dependent consolidation processes that are critical for long-term retention. The goal of the proposed research is to assess whether and how learning mode alters the memory systems and sleep-dependent consolidation processes that support statistical learning.  In the first proposed study, the effect of learning mode on the memory systems recruited for statistical learning will be evaluated, using a combination of behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses. In the second proposed study, the effect of learning mode on sleep-dependent consolidation of statistical representations will be assessed, using a combination of behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) analyses. Because patients often show dissociations of implicit and explicit memory, understanding how learning mode may modulate the memory systems and subsequent sleep-dependent consolidation processes that underlie statistical learning could have tremendous potential to inform treatments for language disorders. For example, by manipulating learning mode, therapies may be developed to selectively target one memory system in order to compensate for dysfunctions in the other, or to promote sleep-dependent consolidation.  The proposed fellowship training will provide instruction in two main methodological areas: (1) sleep neurobiology and (2) fMRI analyses. Training in these two different areas will be integrated by the common goal of understanding how learning mode alters the memory systems and consolidation processes that support statistical learning.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Difficulties with language acquisition are characteristic of a wide range of disorders, such as specific language impairment and autism, and present a major barrier to normal functioning. Statistical learning, the process of extracting complex patterns from the environment, is thought to play a critical role in language acquisition, with deficits in statistical learning potentially contributing to language-related disorders. The current proposal aims to understand how learning mode influences the memory and consolidation processes that underlie statistical learning and may ultimately inform treatments for those with language-related disorders.                ","Statistical learning, memory systems, and sleep-based memory consolidation",8979446,F32HD078223,"['Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Awareness', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavioral', 'Cerebellum', 'Characteristics', 'Cognitive', 'Conscious', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Crude Extracts', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Familiarity', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Napping', 'Neocortex', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reaction Time', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sleep', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'career', 'density', 'implicit memory', 'insight', 'memory consolidation', 'memory retrieval', 'operation', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'specific language impairment']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F32,2015,54194,-0.03148935333022322
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs.

"Clinic Interactions of a Brain-Computer Interface for Communication ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for communication is becoming a reality for individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) who cannot rely on speech or writing to express themselves. While the majority of research efforts are devoted to technology development to address problems of stability, reliability and/or classification, clinical and behavioral challenges are becoming more apparent as individuals with SSPI and their family/care teams assess the systems during novice or long-term trials. The objective of the RSVP Keyboard(tm) BCI translational research team is to address the clinical challenges raised during functional BCI use with innovative engineering design, thereby enhancing the potential of this novel assistive technology. Four specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop a BCI Communication Application Suite (BCI-CAS) that offers a set of language modules to people with SSPI that can meet their language/literacy skills; (2) to develop improved statistical signal models for personalized feature extraction, artifact/interference handling, and robust, accurate intent evidence extraction from physiologic signals; (3) to develop improved language models and stimulus sequence optimization methods; and (4) to evaluate cognitive variables that affect learning and performance of the BCI-CAS. Five language modules are proposed that rely on a multimodal evidence fusion framework for model-based context-aware optimal intent inference: RSVP Keyboard(tm) generative spelling; RSVP texting; RSVP in-context typing; RSVP in-context icon typing; and binary yes/no responses with SSVEPs. Usability data on the current RSVP Keyboard(tm) and SSVEP system drive all proposed aims. Users select a language module, and the BCI system optimizes performance for each individual based on user adaptation, intent inference, and personalized language modeling. A unique simulation function drives individualization of system parameters. The robustness of the BCI customization efforts are evaluated continually by adults with SSPI and neurotypical controls in an iterative fashion. The effect of three intervention programs that address the cognitive construct of attention (process-specific attention training, mindfulness meditation training and novel stimulus presentations) will be implemented through hypothesis-driven single subject designs. Thirty participants, ages 21 years and older with SSPI will be included in home-based interventions. By measuring information transfer rate (ITR), user satisfaction, and intrinsic user factors, we will identify learning strategies that influence BCI sill acquisition and performance for adults with neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental conditions. The translational teams include (1) signal processing (Erdogmus); (2) clinical neurophysiology (Oken); (3) natural language processing (Bedrick/Gorman); and (4) assistive technology (Fried-Oken). We continue to rely on a solid Bayesian foundation and theoretical frameworks: ICF disability classification (WHO, 2001), the AAC model of participation (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013) and the Matching Person to Technology Model (Scherer, 2002).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The populations of patients with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means to interface with communication systems. The BCI Communication Applications Suite is a hybrid brain-computer interface that is an innovative technological advance so that patients and their families can participate in daily activities and advocate for improvements in standard clinical care.

"Developing an Evidence-Based Treatment Continuum for Spoken and Written Language DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How can recovery from acquired language impairment be maximized? This question is central to the focus of every clinician and clinical researcher working with adults with aphasia, alexia, and agraphia. Nearly six decades of treatment research has yielded evidence supporting the efficacy of a wide range of language rehabilitation approaches. Unfortunately, the research efforts have been directed toward treatment approaches in isolation, and few, if any, researchers have considered the full scope and sequence of treatments necessary to maximize language recovery. In our current research, we tackled this issue with respect to the treatment of acquired agraphia, yielding evidence to support a treatment continuum for single-word writing. In the current proposal, we aim to build on the re-trained skills to maximize lexical retrieval in the spoken language modality, and to extend the treatment sequence to text-level reading and written composition. Our approach is novel in its focus on the interactive contribution of semantic, phonological, and orthographic processes. This perspective stems from evidence that literate adults have strongly established links among these three central language components, and the promotion of interactive processing of residual (and re-trained) skills in each domain can advance performance at multiple levels within the language system (sublexical, lexical, and sentence). We will examine a hierarchically structured treatment continuum where gaining mastery at a given level provides the scaffolding for advancing to the next level. A decision tree is proposed to guide the sequence for each individual in an algorithmic fashion. Using a case series approach, we propose to implement treatment with 50 individuals who reflect a diverse range of severity levels and behavioral and lesion profiles. Individual responses to treatment will be evaluated relative to performance on a comprehensive assessment of language before and after critical phases of treatment, allowing us to test the proposed algorithm. Language behavior and treatment outcomes will also be considered relative to the location and extent of brain damage affecting critical cortical networks. This work will advance the understanding of sequential treatment outcomes, and will serve to establish guidelines regarding treatment candidacy across the continuum. Ultimately, this study has the potential to change the way that clinicians plan treatment: shifting from the administration of isolated treatments to a planned sequence of interventions to maximize language recovery.

"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment.        The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. By exploring how differences in language characteristics, in conjunction with neurocognitive individual differences, shape the trajectory of acquiring literacy skills in a new language and how those skills, in turn, impact native language performance, this proposed research aims to provide new understanding of challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and language environment.

"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

"Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Implicit learning procedures have the potential to greatly enhance language training, and yet have received little attention in the aphasia rehabilitation literature. Preliminary evidence of implicit learning ability in individuals with aphasia suggests that this approach could lead to less effortful language rehabilitation strategies, which may be used in combination with established methods of explicit treatment of grammatical ability. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to further the understanding of learning processes in aphasia, and to use that knowledge to engage patients in language learning strategies that will be most beneficial for language recovery. The specific objective of the proposed project is to test an implicit approach to artificial grammar learning in healthy and agrammatic aphasic individuals using a statistical learning paradigm. The central hypothesis is that implicit learning mechanisms, which are effective in deriving grammatical structure from statistical relationships in language, remain intact in individuals with aphasia, and that grammar learning is enhanced when passive language exposure is combined with active practice. The proposed research will be the first to test learning and short-term retention of an artificial phrae structure grammar under implicit learning conditions in individuals with agrammatic aphasia and healthy age-matched adults. Participants in this study will receive repeated passive exposure to the grammar on two consecutive days, and their acquisition and 24-hour retention of the grammatical rules will be evaluated by grammaticality judgment tests. The proposed research will also use the artificial grammar learning task with healthy young adults to test the relative effects of passive exposure to the grammar compared to active practice with feedback and a combination of both approaches. These contributions are significant because they are the first steps toward evaluation of an approach that utilizes patients' retained learning abilities and hence can improve the quality of life of individuals with aphasia.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to further the understanding of language learning strategies that are effective and efficient for healthy adults and for individual with impaired language as a result of brain damage. The successful completion of this project will promote innovative treatments that advance the recovery of communication abilities and hence improve the quality of life of individuals with acquired language disorders.                ",Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach,8642022,F31DC013204,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agrammatism', 'Aphasia', 'Attention', 'Brain Injuries', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perceptual learning', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction Time', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'aphasia rehabilitation', 'aphasic', 'base', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language training', 'learning ability', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'sequence learning', 'young adult']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2014,35352,0.10770665280977389
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs. Jan Edwards and Julie Washington, UW-Madison), toddlers with Williams Syndrome (with Drs.

"Developing an Evidence-Based Treatment Continuum for Spoken and Written Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How can recovery from acquired language impairment be maximized? This question is central to the focus of every clinician and clinical researcher working with adults with aphasia, alexia, and agraphia. Nearly six decades of treatment research has yielded evidence supporting the efficacy of a wide range of language rehabilitation approaches. Unfortunately, the research efforts have been directed toward treatment approaches in isolation, and few, if any, researchers have considered the full scope and sequence of treatments necessary to maximize language recovery. In our current research, we tackled this issue with respect to the treatment of acquired agraphia, yielding evidence to support a treatment continuum for single-word writing. In the current proposal, we aim to build on the re-trained skills to maximize lexical retrieval in the spoken language modality, and to extend the treatment sequence to text-level reading and written composition. Our approach is novel in its focus on the interactive contribution of semantic, phonological, and orthographic processes. This perspective stems from evidence that literate adults have strongly established links among these three central language components, and the promotion of interactive processing of residual (and re-trained) skills in each domain can advance performance at multiple levels within the language system (sublexical, lexical, and sentence). We will examine a hierarchically structured treatment continuum where gaining mastery at a given level provides the scaffolding for advancing to the next level. A decision tree is proposed to guide the sequence for each individual in an algorithmic fashion. Using a case series approach, we propose to implement treatment with 50 individuals who reflect a diverse range of severity levels and behavioral and lesion profiles. Individual responses to treatment will be evaluated relative to performance on a comprehensive assessment of language before and after critical phases of treatment, allowing us to test the proposed algorithm. Language behavior and treatment outcomes will also be considered relative to the location and extent of brain damage affecting critical cortical networks. This work will advance the understanding of sequential treatment outcomes, and will serve to establish guidelines regarding treatment candidacy across the continuum. Ultimately, this study has the potential to change the way that clinicians plan treatment: shifting from the administration of isolated treatments to a planned sequence of interventions to maximize language recovery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 1 million Americans have persistent acquired language impairment due to brain damage. The rehabilitation of spoken and written language impairments is a high priority for affected individuals, and the quality and efficiency of treatment approaches are critical issues for patients, family members, speech-language pathologists, and third-party payers.

The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

"Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Implicit learning procedures have the potential to greatly enhance language training, and yet have received little attention in the aphasia rehabilitation literature. Preliminary evidence of implicit learning ability in individuals with aphasia suggests that this approach could lead to less effortful language rehabilitation strategies, which may be used in combination with established methods of explicit treatment of grammatical ability. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to further the understanding of learning processes in aphasia, and to use that knowledge to engage patients in language learning strategies that will be most beneficial for language recovery. The specific objective of the proposed project is to test an implicit approach to artificial grammar learning in healthy and agrammatic aphasic individuals using a statistical learning paradigm. The central hypothesis is that implicit learning mechanisms, which are effective in deriving grammatical structure from statistical relationships in language, remain intact in individuals with aphasia, and that grammar learning is enhanced when passive language exposure is combined with active practice. The proposed research will be the first to test learning and short-term retention of an artificial phrae structure grammar under implicit learning conditions in individuals with agrammatic aphasia and healthy age-matched adults. Participants in this study will receive repeated passive exposure to the grammar on two consecutive days, and their acquisition and 24-hour retention of the grammatical rules will be evaluated by grammaticality judgment tests. The proposed research will also use the artificial grammar learning task with healthy young adults to test the relative effects of passive exposure to the grammar compared to active practice with feedback and a combination of both approaches. These contributions are significant because they are the first steps toward evaluation of an approach that utilizes patients' retained learning abilities and hence can improve the quality of life of individuals with aphasia.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to further the understanding of language learning strategies that are effective and efficient for healthy adults and for individual with impaired language as a result of brain damage. The successful completion of this project will promote innovative treatments that advance the recovery of communication abilities and hence improve the quality of life of individuals with acquired language disorders.                ",Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach,8522948,F31DC013204,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agrammatism', 'Aphasia', 'Attention', 'Brain Injuries', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perceptual learning', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction Time', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'aphasia rehabilitation', 'aphasic', 'base', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language training', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'sequence learning', 'young adult']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2013,34908,0.10770665280977389
"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies of infants, children, and adults will document the key structural variables in language learning that enable a distributional mechanism of category formation to operate and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and domain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs.

"Developing an Evidence-Based Treatment Continuum for Spoken and Written Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How can recovery from acquired language impairment be maximized? This question is central to the focus of every clinician and clinical researcher working with adults with aphasia, alexia, and agraphia. Nearly six decades of treatment research has yielded evidence supporting the efficacy of a wide range of language rehabilitation approaches. Unfortunately, the research efforts have been directed toward treatment approaches in isolation, and few, if any, researchers have considered the full scope and sequence of treatments necessary to maximize language recovery. In our current research, we tackled this issue with respect to the treatment of acquired agraphia, yielding evidence to support a treatment continuum for single-word writing. In the current proposal, we aim to build on the re-trained skills to maximize lexical retrieval in the spoken language modality, and to extend the treatment sequence to text-level reading and written composition. Our approach is novel in its focus on the interactive contribution of semantic, phonological, and orthographic processes. This perspective stems from evidence that literate adults have strongly established links among these three central language components, and the promotion of interactive processing of residual (and re-trained) skills in each domain can advance performance at multiple levels within the language system (sublexical, lexical, and sentence). We will examine a hierarchically structured treatment continuum where gaining mastery at a given level provides the scaffolding for advancing to the next level. A decision tree is proposed to guide the sequence for each individual in an algorithmic fashion. Using a case series approach, we propose to implement treatment with 50 individuals who reflect a diverse range of severity levels and behavioral and lesion profiles. Individual responses to treatment will be evaluated relative to performance on a comprehensive assessment of language before and after critical phases of treatment, allowing us to test the proposed algorithm. Language behavior and treatment outcomes will also be considered relative to the location and extent of brain damage affecting critical cortical networks. This work will advance the understanding of sequential treatment outcomes, and will serve to establish guidelines regarding treatment candidacy across the continuum. Ultimately, this study has the potential to change the way that clinicians plan treatment: shifting from the administration of isolated treatments to a planned sequence of interventions to maximize language recovery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 1 million Americans have persistent acquired language impairment due to brain damage. The rehabilitation of spoken and written language impairments is a high priority for affected individuals, and the quality and efficiency of treatment approaches are critical issues for patients, family members, speech-language pathologists, and third-party payers. The research proposed here has the potential to significantly impact the planning and implementation of behavioral treatment in a manner that maximizes recovery of function.

"Computational characterization of language use in autism spectrum disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atypical or impaired language is one of the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet, what the precise characteristics of language are in ASD and how they differ from those in other disorders such as Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is still substantially unknown. An important obstacle for the study of language in any disorder is that conventional structured instruments (i.e., instruments consisting of a sequence of items, each eliciting a - typically brief - response, such as the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals [CELF]) may not provide adequate breadth of information: Analysis of natural language samples is required  The proposed research will build on recent progress in ""Natural Language Processing"" (NLP) technology, an area of Computer Science concerned with computational analysis of text. The goal of the proposed research is to develop and validate new NLP based methods that automatically measure language characteristics of ASD based on raw (i.e., not coded) transcripts of natural language samples. The objective is to improve the analysis of natural language samples by enhancing efficiency, reliability, and richness of information extracted.  Data on three groups of children ages four to eight will be analyzed, obtained from an earlier study: ASD, SLI, and typically developing children.  If successful, the new methods will have important impacts on research and clinical practice for ASD and for other disorders in which language is affected, by enabling analysis of more representative and ecologically valid natural language samples as well as by creating opportunities for discovery of currently unknown language characteristics of ASD by the effortless extraction of numerous language features.        Although atypical or impaired language is one of the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), what the precise characteristics of language are in ASD and how they differ from those in other disorders such as Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is still substantially unknown, in part due to the paucity of instruments for the analysis of natural language samples.

"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment.        The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. By exploring how differences in language characteristics, in conjunction with neurocognitive individual differences, shape the trajectory of acquiring literacy skills in a new language and how those skills, in turn, impact native language performance, this proposed research aims to provide new understanding of challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and language environment.

"Infant Statistical Learning in Natural Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infants are adept at tracking statistical regularities to segment words in continuous speech. Researchers have documented infants' learning abilities using highly simplified artificial languages as speech input. However, natural language is replete with variability. Infants listening to speech encounter different speakers, different word lengths, and numerous other dimensions of complexity. The proposed experiments will use speech that captures key aspects of the natural variation observed in infants' language environments to test whether infants use statistical learning mechanisms in identifying word boundaries. This research will provide a rigorous test of whether statistical learning is in fact linked to early language acquisition. Specific Aim 1 is to examine how infants segment words given variability in utterance types-specifically, the presence of both continuous speech and isolated words. A preliminary study showed that isolated words enhance infants' attention to statistical regularities in fluent, natural speech. Experiment 1 will test the hypothesis that hearing words in isolation helps infants discover other words in continuous speech. Experiment 2 will explore word segmentation given variation in voices, testing whether isolated words enhance statistical learning when speech comes from multiple talkers. Specific Aim 2 is to investigate how variability in language experience influences infants' subsequent detection of statistical regularities in fluent speech. In Experiment 3, infants will first receive brief laboratory exposure to novel isolated words. This pre-familiarization is expected to constrain infants' abilities to establish word boundaries in continuous speech. Experiment 4 will test whether cross-linguistic differences in the proportion of multisyllabic words in infant-directed speech shape infants' word segmentation abilities. Spanish-learning infants, who hear far more multisyllabic words than English-learning infants over the first year, are expected to show greater facility in segmenting trisyllabic words from continuous speech than English-learning infants. The results will assess the degree to which previous learning leads to expectations that facilitate processing future speech, or whether infants' computational abilities operate continuously at each moment in time. The outcomes of these studies will inform future research exploring statistical learning abilities in young children with emergent language impairments.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to understand how typically developing infants discover structure in the complex speech they hear from caregivers. Future studies will use these tasks to assess language learning in children exhibiting difficulties with language (e.g., children at risk for specific language impairment, children with emergent autism spectrum disorder, or deaf children with cochlear implants). The eventual goals are to investigate whether the mechanisms responsible for learning are compromised in these clinical populations, and to develop more appropriate tools for early diagnosis and intervention.

"Measurement of the time course of statistical learning in word segmentation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Statistical learning refers to a wide variety of phenomena, many of which have been argued to be related to language acquisition. However, there is little agreement on the process that underlies statistical learning. Several different accounts have been proposed, but it has been difficult to differentiate between these accounts as many converge on the same end result of learning. To identify the process responsible for statistical learning, it is necessary to more closely examine behavioral data that can characterize the dynamic characteristics of learning over the course of exposure. The objective of the current project is to develop and apply a novel method for examining statistical learning of linguistic materials. This method will provide more comprehensive and sensitive results than prior methods, which will enable these experiments to distinguish between theories of statistical learning in a way that has not been previously possible. In these experiments, participants will be exposed to a stream of syllables made up for nonsense words. Within this stream, words consistently co-occur, while syllable conjunctions formed across word boundaries are less predictable. Participants will be asked to listen for a particular syllable within the speech stream, and respond with a button press when they hear it. For some of these participants, the syllable will occur in an unpredictable location (for example, go in golabu is relatively unpredictable, because it can occur after the end of any word in the speech stream). For other participants, the syllable will occur in a predictable location (for example, bu in golabu is consistently signaled by the presence of both go and la). The experiments outlined in this proposal are a first step towards a process-based, mechanistic account of statistical learning. The first experiment demonstrates that this novel methodology is feasible, and will assess the extent to which the serial reaction time measure correlates with more standard post-test measures. The second and third experiments seek to test process-level predictions of a theory of statistical learning. Experiment 2 assesses the extent to which working memory is related to performance in the task, especially on different word lengths. Experiment 3 assesses a proposal about how chunking might be supplemented by processes of comparison to make learning of non-adjacent regularities possible. Finally, Experiment 4 asks how multiple cues to segmentation are integrated while learning is occurring in real time. By identifying the dynamic characteristics of learning over the course of exposure to the input, this research will test and refine theories of statistical learning in ways that have not previously been possible.       This research proposal will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying language learning. Understanding these mechanisms is critically important for designing interventions that improve language acquisition in both atypically developing children, and adults struggling to acquire a second language.

"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies of infants, children, and adults will document the key structural variables in language learning that enable a distributional mechanism of category formation to operate and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and domain.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs.

"Developing an Evidence-Based Treatment Continuum for Spoken and Written Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How can recovery from acquired language impairment be maximized? This question is central to the focus of every clinician and clinical researcher working with adults with aphasia, alexia, and agraphia. Nearly six decades of treatment research has yielded evidence supporting the efficacy of a wide range of language rehabilitation approaches. Unfortunately, the research efforts have been directed toward treatment approaches in isolation, and few, if any, researchers have considered the full scope and sequence of treatments necessary to maximize language recovery. In our current research, we tackled this issue with respect to the treatment of acquired agraphia, yielding evidence to support a treatment continuum for single-word writing. In the current proposal, we aim to build on the re-trained skills to maximize lexical retrieval in the spoken language modality, and to extend the treatment sequence to text-level reading and written composition. Our approach is novel in its focus on the interactive contribution of semantic, phonological, and orthographic processes. This perspective stems from evidence that literate adults have strongly established links among these three central language components, and the promotion of interactive processing of residual (and re-trained) skills in each domain can advance performance at multiple levels within the language system (sublexical, lexical, and sentence). We will examine a hierarchically structured treatment continuum where gaining mastery at a given level provides the scaffolding for advancing to the next level. A decision tree is proposed to guide the sequence for each individual in an algorithmic fashion. Using a case series approach, we propose to implement treatment with 50 individuals who reflect a diverse range of severity levels and behavioral and lesion profiles. Individual responses to treatment will be evaluated relative to performance on a comprehensive assessment of language before and after critical phases of treatment, allowing us to test the proposed algorithm. Language behavior and treatment outcomes will also be considered relative to the location and extent of brain damage affecting critical cortical networks. This work will advance the understanding of sequential treatment outcomes, and will serve to establish guidelines regarding treatment candidacy across the continuum. Ultimately, this study has the potential to change the way that clinicians plan treatment: shifting from the administration of isolated treatments to a planned sequence of interventions to maximize language recovery.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 1 million Americans have persistent acquired language impairment due to brain damage. The rehabilitation of spoken and written language impairments is a high priority for affected individuals, and the quality and efficiency of treatment approaches are critical issues for patients, family members, speech-language pathologists, and third-party payers. The research proposed here has the potential to significantly impact the planning and implementation of behavioral treatment in a manner that maximizes recovery of function.

"Computational characterization of language use in autism spectrum disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atypical or impaired language is one of the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet, what the precise characteristics of language are in ASD and how they differ from those in other disorders such as Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is still substantially unknown. An important obstacle for the study of language in any disorder is that conventional structured instruments (i.e., instruments consisting of a sequence of items, each eliciting a - typically brief - response, such as the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals [CELF]) may not provide adequate breadth of information: Analysis of natural language samples is required  The proposed research will build on recent progress in ""Natural Language Processing"" (NLP) technology, an area of Computer Science concerned with computational analysis of text. The goal of the proposed research is to develop and validate new NLP based methods that automatically measure language characteristics of ASD based on raw (i.e., not coded) transcripts of natural language samples. The objective is to improve the analysis of natural language samples by enhancing efficiency, reliability, and richness of information extracted.  Data on three groups of children ages four to eight will be analyzed, obtained from an earlier study: ASD, SLI, and typically developing children.  If successful, the new methods will have important impacts on research and clinical practice for ASD and for other disorders in which language is affected, by enabling analysis of more representative and ecologically valid natural language samples as well as by creating opportunities for discovery of currently unknown language characteristics of ASD by the effortless extraction of numerous language features.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although atypical or impaired language is one of the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), what the precise characteristics of language are in ASD and how they differ from those in other disorders such as Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is still substantially unknown, in part due to the paucity of instruments for the analysis of natural language samples.

"Linking Statistical Learning to Vocabulary Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research proposed in this application will investigate the connection between statistical learning and vocabulary development. Statistical learning refers to the process of detecting structure in the environment by tracking patterns present in the input. Recent experiments have revealed that infants possess remarkable statistical learning capabilities. Statistical learning may play a significant role in the precocious development of native language sound structure that occurs during the first year of life. During the second year, vocabulary development accelerates. The proposed experiments are motivated by the hypothesis that statistical learning about sounds lays a foundation for word learning. Thus, infants' ability to track statistical regularities may affect the ability to build a vocabulary. This research will examine the relation between individual differences in infants' vocabulary development and individual differences in statistical learning. The experiments will use measures of listening time and looking time to test infants' detection of novel statistical regularities, and to test their knowledge of native-language statistical regularities. Infants will participate speech, non-speech auditory, and visual statistical learning tasks in order to evaluate the coherence of statistical learning across domains. A label-learning task will also tap infants' ability to use native language statistical regularities to acquire new lexical items. In each experiment, infants' performance on experimental tasks will be integrated with measures of their real-world vocabulary development. This findings of this research promise to inform understanding of the underlying mechanism that contribute to individual differences in language acquisition.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research investigates the relation between individual differences in vocabulary development and how they relate to individual differences in statistical learning, a fundamental language acquisition mechanism. The findings from this project will influence understanding of typical language development and have potential to affect understanding of language delays and disorders.

"Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will examine the ability of infants, children, and adults to learn non-adjacent regularities in langauge. Almost all aspects of language (phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics) contain structural relations between elements that are reliable and predictable and yet obstructed by other elements. Common examples include the relationship between ""is"" and ""-ing"" from morphology, or the relationship between noun phrases and verb phases in syntax. To date, theories of language learning have not adequately addressed how learners acquire structural knowledge of this type. The difficulty of learning these types of relationsips is one of the biggest criticisms of statistical learning theories of language acquisition, which largely involve learning language by tracking transitional probabilities between adjacent elements in language. The work is also especially important because failure to learn these types of non-adjacent regularities is a hallmark of many language disorders like Specific Language Impariment (SLI). The first aim of this research is to show how language learners might acquire knowledge about non- adjacent dependancies using knowledge of the language's hiearchical structure, and to see if this structure is learnable by an enriched form of statistical learning. We hypothesize that learners will be able to discover probability-dependant ""chunks"" in language, and use these chunks to transform non-adjacent relationships into adjacent relationships. This aim will be addressed by behavioral experiments with infants and adults. The second aim is to see if people find it easier to learn non-adjacent dependancies in language when those dependancies can be tied to language-external semantic cues. For example, a verb (or a verb phrase) and a direct object (or its noun phrase) might be tightly coupled linguisticly, even if they are separated by embedded clauses in particular sentences. It may be that the way learners acquire this linguistic regularity is by keeping track of the semantic or conceptual association between the verb's and direct object's real world referents. We hypothesize that in conditions where there is semantic relatedness between nonadacent elements in language, this will faciliate learning of the linguistic non-adjacent regularity. This aim will be addressed by a behavioral experiment with children and by a computational model designed to explore how the interaciton of semantic and linguistic knowledge facilliates learning. In summary, proposed research will address a critical question about how people learn the structure of language, address a key shortcoming of one current theory of language acquistion, and have important implications for language disorders like SLI.             n/a",Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties,8097952,F31DC009936,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Beryllium', 'Child', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Infant', 'Information Distribution', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Morphology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'instrument', 'lexical', 'model design', 'phonology', 'phrases', 'research study', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'theories']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2011,14727,0.16101462016516901
"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English.

"Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental task in sentence comprehension involves assigning semantic roles to sentence constituents, determining who does what to whom. Verb knowledge plays a central role in this task. The verb determines what constituents can appear in the sentence, and what participant roles they will convey. In learning a new verb, a child must determine what relationship among participants the verb refers to, without the set of semantic instructions provided by the verb. The syntactic bootstrapping theory proposes that children use precursors of the adult's knowledge of syntax to understand sentences and therefore to learn verbs. This view is supported by evidence that children as young as 2 assign different meanings to verbs presented in different sentence structures. The proposed research asks what syntactic cues are helpful early in acquisition, before many of the complexities of syntax acquisition have been conquered. First, we argue that children treat the number of nouns in the sentence as a cue to its semantic predicate- argument structure. The number of nouns in the sentence is useful because it provides a probabilistic indicator of the verb's number of arguments. Second, early syntactic bootstrapping requires that children represent language experience in an abstract mental vocabulary that permits rapid generalization of syntactic learning to new verbs. Thus, we argue that language-specific grammatical learning, such as detecting the significance of word order in English, should transfer quickly to sentences containing new verbs, permitting progressively finer constraint on sentence interpretation and verb learning. This project explores how syntactic bootstrapping begins, and how it interacts with early progress in syntax acquisition. We take two complementary approaches: (1) Experiments with infants and toddlers will investigate the detection and use of the proposed simple structural cues to sentence interpretation and verb learning. (2) Computational experiments using a system for automatic semantic role labeling will test the main claims of our account using a substantial sample of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies is intended to advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and to guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing. The proposed research will help us to understand how infants and toddlers learn the words and syntax of their native languages; such research will contribute to the detection and remediation of language delays, and to language pedagogy.           n/a",Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension,8042604,R01HD054448,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Child', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Event', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hearing', 'Heart', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Linguistics', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Agents', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computer studies', 'experience', 'feeding', 'lens', 'lexical', 'novel', 'programs', 'remediation', 'research study', 'success', 'syntax', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2011,291831,0.09529690344850664
"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.           Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input.

"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively. Understanding those mechanisms and how they might go wrong or be bolstered are surely fundamental to understanding the origins of developmental language disorders that delay or alter early lexical learning. Implementing procedures to benefit children with developmental disorders typically involves altering or highlighting aspects of the learning environment. This requires a principled understanding of the structure and regularities of that environment and processes of statistical learning.           n/a","Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints",8094445,R01HD056029,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ear', 'Empirical Research', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Play', 'Poaceae', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'data mining', 'developmental disease', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'haptics', 'insight', 'interest', 'lexical', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'programs', 'research study', 'simulation', 'social', 'statistics']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2011,176482,0.05535071099110036
"Measurement of the time course of statistical learning in word segmentation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Statistical learning refers to a wide variety of phenomena, many of which have been argued to be related to language acquisition. However, there is little agreement on the process that underlies statistical learning. Several different accounts have been proposed, but it has been difficult to differentiate between these accounts as many converge on the same end result of learning. To identify the process responsible for statistical learning, it is necessary to more closely examine behavioral data that can characterize the dynamic characteristics of learning over the course of exposure. The objective of the current project is to develop and apply a novel method for examining statistical learning of linguistic materials. This method will provide more comprehensive and sensitive results than prior methods, which will enable these experiments to distinguish between theories of statistical learning in a way that has not been previously possible. In these experiments, participants will be exposed to a stream of syllables made up for nonsense words. Within this stream, words consistently co-occur, while syllable conjunctions formed across word boundaries are less predictable. Participants will be asked to listen for a particular syllable within the speech stream, and respond with a button press when they hear it. For some of these participants, the syllable will occur in an unpredictable location (for example, go in golabu is relatively unpredictable, because it can occur after the end of any word in the speech stream). For other participants, the syllable will occur in a predictable location (for example, bu in golabu is consistently signaled by the presence of both go and la). The experiments outlined in this proposal are a first step towards a process-based, mechanistic account of statistical learning. The first experiment demonstrates that this novel methodology is feasible, and will assess the extent to which the serial reaction time measure correlates with more standard post-test measures. The second and third experiments seek to test process-level predictions of a theory of statistical learning. Experiment 2 assesses the extent to which working memory is related to performance in the task, especially on different word lengths. Experiment 3 assesses a proposal about how chunking might be supplemented by processes of comparison to make learning of non-adjacent regularities possible. Finally, Experiment 4 asks how multiple cues to segmentation are integrated while learning is occurring in real time. By identifying the dynamic characteristics of learning over the course of exposure to the input, this research will test and refine theories of statistical learning in ways that have not previously been possible.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:This research proposal will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying language learning. Understanding these mechanisms is critically important for designing interventions that improve language acquisition in both atypically developing children, and adults struggling to acquire a second language.          This research proposal will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying language learning.

"Infant Statistical Learning in Natural Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infants are adept at tracking statistical regularities to segment words in continuous speech. Researchers have documented infants' learning abilities using highly simplified artificial languages as speech input. However, natural language is replete with variability. Infants listening to speech encounter different speakers, different word lengths, and numerous other dimensions of complexity. The proposed experiments will use speech that captures key aspects of the natural variation observed in infants' language environments to test whether infants use statistical learning mechanisms in identifying word boundaries. This research will provide a rigorous test of whether statistical learning is in fact linked to early language acquisition. Specific Aim 1 is to examine how infants segment words given variability in utterance types-specifically, the presence of both continuous speech and isolated words. A preliminary study showed that isolated words enhance infants' attention to statistical regularities in fluent, natural speech. Experiment 1 will test the hypothesis that hearing words in isolation helps infants discover other words in continuous speech. Experiment 2 will explore word segmentation given variation in voices, testing whether isolated words enhance statistical learning when speech comes from multiple talkers. Specific Aim 2 is to investigate how variability in language experience influences infants' subsequent detection of statistical regularities in fluent speech. In Experiment 3, infants will first receive brief laboratory exposure to novel isolated words. This pre-familiarization is expected to constrain infants' abilities to establish word boundaries in continuous speech. Experiment 4 will test whether cross-linguistic differences in the proportion of multisyllabic words in infant-directed speech shape infants' word segmentation abilities. Spanish-learning infants, who hear far more multisyllabic words than English-learning infants over the first year, are expected to show greater facility in segmenting trisyllabic words from continuous speech than English-learning infants. The results will assess the degree to which previous learning leads to expectations that facilitate processing future speech, or whether infants' computational abilities operate continuously at each moment in time. The outcomes of these studies will inform future research exploring statistical learning abilities in young children with emergent language impairments.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to understand how typically developing infants discover structure in the complex speech they hear from caregivers. Future studies will use these tasks to assess language learning in children exhibiting difficulties with language (e.g., children at risk for specific language impairment, children with emergent autism spectrum disorder, or deaf children with cochlear implants). The eventual goals are to investigate whether the mechanisms responsible for learning are compromised in these clinical populations, and to develop more appropriate tools for early diagnosis and intervention.           The goal of this research is to understand how typically developing infants discover structure in the complex speech they hear from caregivers.

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies of infants, children, and adults will document the key structural variables in language learning that enable a distributional mechanism of category formation to operate and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and domain.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes.

"Developing an Evidence-Based Treatment Continuum for Spoken and Written Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How can recovery from acquired language impairment be maximized? This question is central to the focus of every clinician and clinical researcher working with adults with aphasia, alexia, and agraphia. Nearly six decades of treatment research has yielded evidence supporting the efficacy of a wide range of language rehabilitation approaches. Unfortunately, the research efforts have been directed toward treatment approaches in isolation, and few, if any, researchers have considered the full scope and sequence of treatments necessary to maximize language recovery. In our current research, we tackled this issue with respect to the treatment of acquired agraphia, yielding evidence to support a treatment continuum for single-word writing. In the current proposal, we aim to build on the re-trained skills to maximize lexical retrieval in the spoken language modality, and to extend the treatment sequence to text-level reading and written composition. Our approach is novel in its focus on the interactive contribution of semantic, phonological, and orthographic processes. This perspective stems from evidence that literate adults have strongly established links among these three central language components, and the promotion of interactive processing of residual (and re-trained) skills in each domain can advance performance at multiple levels within the language system (sublexical, lexical, and sentence). We will examine a hierarchically structured treatment continuum where gaining mastery at a given level provides the scaffolding for advancing to the next level. A decision tree is proposed to guide the sequence for each individual in an algorithmic fashion. Using a case series approach, we propose to implement treatment with 50 individuals who reflect a diverse range of severity levels and behavioral and lesion profiles. Individual responses to treatment will be evaluated relative to performance on a comprehensive assessment of language before and after critical phases of treatment, allowing us to test the proposed algorithm. Language behavior and treatment outcomes will also be considered relative to the location and extent of brain damage affecting critical cortical networks. This work will advance the understanding of sequential treatment outcomes, and will serve to establish guidelines regarding treatment candidacy across the continuum. Ultimately, this study has the potential to change the way that clinicians plan treatment: shifting from the administration of isolated treatments to a planned sequence of interventions to maximize language recovery.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 1 million Americans have persistent acquired language impairment due to brain damage.

"Linking Statistical Learning to Vocabulary Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research proposed in this application will investigate the connection between statistical learning and vocabulary development. Statistical learning refers to the process of detecting structure in the environment by tracking patterns present in the input. Recent experiments have revealed that infants possess remarkable statistical learning capabilities. Statistical learning may play a significant role in the precocious development of native language sound structure that occurs during the first year of life. During the second year, vocabulary development accelerates. The proposed experiments are motivated by the hypothesis that statistical learning about sounds lays a foundation for word learning. Thus, infants' ability to track statistical regularities may affect the ability to build a vocabulary. This research will examine the relation between individual differences in infants' vocabulary development and individual differences in statistical learning. The experiments will use measures of listening time and looking time to test infants' detection of novel statistical regularities, and to test their knowledge of native-language statistical regularities. Infants will participate speech, non-speech auditory, and visual statistical learning tasks in order to evaluate the coherence of statistical learning across domains. A label-learning task will also tap infants' ability to use native language statistical regularities to acquire new lexical items. In each experiment, infants' performance on experimental tasks will be integrated with measures of their real-world vocabulary development. This findings of this research promise to inform understanding of the underlying mechanism that contribute to individual differences in language acquisition.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research investigates the relation between individual differences in vocabulary development and how they relate to individual differences in statistical learning, a fundamental language acquisition mechanism. The findings from this project will influence understanding of typical language development and have potential to affect understanding of language delays and disorders.

"Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will examine the ability of infants, children, and adults to learn non-adjacent regularities in langauge. Almost all aspects of language (phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics) contain structural relations between elements that are reliable and predictable and yet obstructed by other elements. Common examples include the relationship between ""is"" and ""-ing"" from morphology, or the relationship between noun phrases and verb phases in syntax. To date, theories of language learning have not adequately addressed how learners acquire structural knowledge of this type. The difficulty of learning these types of relationsips is one of the biggest criticisms of statistical learning theories of language acquisition, which largely involve learning language by tracking transitional probabilities between adjacent elements in language. The work is also especially important because failure to learn these types of non-adjacent regularities is a hallmark of many language disorders like Specific Language Impariment (SLI). The first aim of this research is to show how language learners might acquire knowledge about non- adjacent dependancies using knowledge of the language's hiearchical structure, and to see if this structure is learnable by an enriched form of statistical learning. We hypothesize that learners will be able to discover probability-dependant ""chunks"" in language, and use these chunks to transform non-adjacent relationships into adjacent relationships. This aim will be addressed by behavioral experiments with infants and adults. The second aim is to see if people find it easier to learn non-adjacent dependancies in language when those dependancies can be tied to language-external semantic cues. For example, a verb (or a verb phrase) and a direct object (or its noun phrase) might be tightly coupled linguisticly, even if they are separated by embedded clauses in particular sentences. It may be that the way learners acquire this linguistic regularity is by keeping track of the semantic or conceptual association between the verb's and direct object's real world referents. We hypothesize that in conditions where there is semantic relatedness between nonadacent elements in language, this will faciliate learning of the linguistic non-adjacent regularity. This aim will be addressed by a behavioral experiment with children and by a computational model designed to explore how the interaciton of semantic and linguistic knowledge facilliates learning. In summary, proposed research will address a critical question about how people learn the structure of language, address a key shortcoming of one current theory of language acquistion, and have important implications for language disorders like SLI.             n/a",Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties,7908812,F31DC009936,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Infant', 'Information Distribution', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Morphology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'instrument', 'lexical', 'model design', 'phonology', 'phrases', 'research study', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'theories']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2010,29034,0.16101462016516901
"Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental task in sentence comprehension involves assigning semantic roles to sentence constituents, determining who does what to whom. Verb knowledge plays a central role in this task. The verb determines what constituents can appear in the sentence, and what participant roles they will convey. In learning a new verb, a child must determine what relationship among participants the verb refers to, without the set of semantic instructions provided by the verb. The syntactic bootstrapping theory proposes that children use precursors of the adult's knowledge of syntax to understand sentences and therefore to learn verbs. This view is supported by evidence that children as young as 2 assign different meanings to verbs presented in different sentence structures. The proposed research asks what syntactic cues are helpful early in acquisition, before many of the complexities of syntax acquisition have been conquered. First, we argue that children treat the number of nouns in the sentence as a cue to its semantic predicate- argument structure. The number of nouns in the sentence is useful because it provides a probabilistic indicator of the verb's number of arguments. Second, early syntactic bootstrapping requires that children represent language experience in an abstract mental vocabulary that permits rapid generalization of syntactic learning to new verbs. Thus, we argue that language-specific grammatical learning, such as detecting the significance of word order in English, should transfer quickly to sentences containing new verbs, permitting progressively finer constraint on sentence interpretation and verb learning. This project explores how syntactic bootstrapping begins, and how it interacts with early progress in syntax acquisition. We take two complementary approaches: (1) Experiments with infants and toddlers will investigate the detection and use of the proposed simple structural cues to sentence interpretation and verb learning. (2) Computational experiments using a system for automatic semantic role labeling will test the main claims of our account using a substantial sample of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies is intended to advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and to guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing. The proposed research will help us to understand how infants and toddlers learn the words and syntax of their native languages; such research will contribute to the detection and remediation of language delays, and to language pedagogy.           n/a",Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension,7758297,R01HD054448,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Child', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Event', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hearing', 'Heart', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Linguistics', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Agents', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computer studies', 'experience', 'feeding', 'lens', 'lexical', 'novel', 'programs', 'remediation', 'research study', 'success', 'syntax', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2010,304201,0.09529690344850664
"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively. Understanding those mechanisms and how they might go wrong or be bolstered are surely fundamental to understanding the origins of developmental language disorders that delay or alter early lexical learning. Implementing procedures to benefit children with developmental disorders typically involves altering or highlighting aspects of the learning environment. This requires a principled understanding of the structure and regularities of that environment and processes of statistical learning.           n/a","Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints",7870420,R01HD056029,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ear', 'Empirical Research', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Play', 'Poaceae', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'data mining', 'developmental disease', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'fenson', 'haptics', 'insight', 'interest', 'lexical', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'programs', 'research study', 'simulation', 'social', 'statistics']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2010,184005,0.05535071099110036
"Social and Statistical Mechanisms of Prelinguistic Vocal Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How do infants learn to produce the sounds of their language? The vocal abilities of infants change dramatically over the first year of life. Beginning with the earliest, immature vocalizations, infants make rapid progress, typically producing their first words by 12 months of age. Along the way, they begin to produce speech-like syllables and to structure sequences of syllables in accordance with the phonological rules of their language environment. While the vocal achievements of the first year are well-described, not nearly as much is known about the mechanisms of change that drive vocal development. Most work focuses on the maturation of the vocal tract, but studies of vocal development in songbirds found that there are also social sources of developmental change. For example, young male cowbirds (Molothrus ater) rely on the reactions of females to shape their immature sounds into functional song. Based on the avian work, the investigators' preliminary studies have shown that infants can learn new patterns of vocalizing from caregivers' reactions to their babbling. How do infants use social feedback to create new, more developmentally advanced, vocalizations? The goal of the proposed research is to understand the mechanisms by which infants incorporate the phonological patterns of their language into their vocal repertoires. Based on preliminary studies, the investigators hypothesize that the contingent responses of caregivers to babbling facilitate infants' statistical learning of the phonological patterns of their language. To investigate this hypothesis, the variability and temporal contingency of speech to 9-month-old infants will be manipulated to assess their effects on vocal learning. The proposed research has important implications for educating parents in providing optimal learning environments for their infants. An understanding of the role of socially guided learning in speech and language could be used to help parents to be more sensitive to their infants' behavior in ways that would facilitate development. Investigating social influences on phonological development can also contribute to the study of speech-language pathology and of processes underlying both successful and disordered communicative development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By illuminating mechanisms by which infants learn to produce the sounds of their language from caregivers' contingent speech, the findings could inform interventions for disordered language development. The results could also be used to help parents and child care providers create social environments that foster and support language growth. Eventually, this research could be used to design preventive programs for infants with a higher risk of language delay (e.g., children with Down Syndrome or SLI).           Project Relevance By illuminating mechanisms by which infants learn to produce the sounds of their language from caregivers' contingent speech, the findings could inform interventions for disordered language development.

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies of infants, children, and adults will document the key structural variables in language learning that enable a distributional mechanism of category formation to operate and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and domain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the categories (noun, verb, etc) are formed from listening to the patterns of words in a small set of sentences. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal children can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.           Public Health Relevance Statement  Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes.

"The Role of Statistical Learning in Acquiring Syntactic Categories    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed experiments will investigate the role of statistical learning in the acquisition of syntactic categories such as ""noun"" and ""verb"". The role of syntactic category knowledge in language acquisition is pervasive; for example, category knowledge both facilitates learning grammatical patterns and facilitates early word learning. While many aspects of language acquisition rely on syntactic category knowledge, the process by which these categories are learned is unclear. The goal of the proposed research is to test the hypothesis that statistical learning plays a role in acquiring syntactic categories. Words from different syntactic categories are distinguishable by statistical cues, such as their distributional properties (i.e., cooccurrence with other words), and their phonological properties (i.e., their sound structure), the first specific aim is to assess infants' sensitivity to these cues in the acquisition of noun and verb categories. If words' statistical properties are used in category learning, infants should be able to use these properties to identify novel category members in the early stages of category acquisition. Moreover, infants' ability to determine the category of novel words should reflect the degree to which they conform to the predominant statistical characteristics of the category, and training on these statistical properties should facilitate their use at younger ages. Infants' ability to categorize novel words will be assessed by testing whether they are mapped to object or action referents. The second specific aim is to test infants' ability to integrate statistical and semantic information in category learning. Acquisition of syntactic categories encompasses learning about both statistical properties and semantic properties, and these cues are correlated in natural language. If infants can integrate these cues, correlations between them should facilitate learning. Infants will be familiarized with an artificial language containing novel categories, and the correlations between statistical and semantic cues will be manipulated. If infants can integrate these cues, they should be better able to detect commonalities in the meanings of words within a category, and to learn the grammatical structures in which these words can occur, when cues are correlated than when they are not. Future studies will test children with Specific Language Impairment and other developmental language disorders (e.g., late talkers), who exhibit impaired word learning abilities and reduced sensitivity to distributional cues identifying syntactic categories. Testing children on these tasks will address the extent to which impaired statistical learning is a contributing factor in these disorders.          n/a",The Role of Statistical Learning in Acquiring Syntactic Categories,7583888,F32HD057698,"['Address', 'Age', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'phonology', 'research study', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2009,50054,0.12776375251825087

"Constraints on Learning from Inconsistent Input All human learners with normal cognitive capacities who are exposed to language input in childhood  manage to acquire a language that looks very much like their input. However, at present we have little  idea how, exactly, learners accomplish this feat. We have little understanding of the nature of the learning  mechanisms that underlie and support language learning. This is the focus of the research in this  proposal. Three general questions guide the research.(1) What are the constraints on language learning  mechanisms? (2) Are the learning mechanisms involved in language acquisition specific to language or  are they of a more general nature? (3) Do these mechanisms change over time as learners age, and if  'so, how? The proposed research examines these questions by investigating the learning of probabilistic  and inconsistent patterns in the input using miniature artificial languages. This provides a rather unique  view of the constraints on learning mechanisms, examining the limits of what can and cannot be learned.  Previous work has shown that learners can acquire probabilistic patterns, however they sometimes  impose consistency on variation. Moreover, children are more likely to change such patterns than are  adults. The present research expands on the earlier results, asking about the nature of the interaction  between learners and input. Series 1 asks about the nature of the input that makes some inconstancy  learnable and some not. The studies examine the limits of veridical learning of inconsistent patterns in  languages, asking questions about the specificity of computations learners can perform, the  representations over which such computations can be performed, and the effect of prior domain-specific  knowledge. Series 2 asks about the nature of the learner, asking why learners regularize over  inconsistency at all.In particular, the studies examine whether working memory constraints, rather than  constraints stemming directly from the learning mechanisms themselves, are an important factor  influencing whether learners acquire the variation or instead impose regularity. Both series will be  conducted with adults and children to examine how learning changes over development. Although the  input in the proposed studies is somewhat atypical, the results from these studies will contribute to our  understanding of the learning mechanisms involved in language acquisition more generally, and  ultimately, this increases our understanding of both normal and disordered acquisition. n/a",Constraints on Learning from Inconsistent Input,7560411,R01HD048572,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age related', 'design', 'information processing', 'programs', 'research study', 'stem']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2009,177315,0.0796314026815956
"Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will examine the ability of infants, children, and adults to learn non-adjacent regularities in langauge. Almost all aspects of language (phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics) contain structural relations between elements that are reliable and predictable and yet obstructed by other elements. Common examples include the relationship between ""is"" and ""-ing"" from morphology, or the relationship between noun phrases and verb phases in syntax. To date, theories of language learning have not adequately addressed how learners acquire structural knowledge of this type. The difficulty of learning these types of relationsips is one of the biggest criticisms of statistical learning theories of language acquisition, which largely involve learning language by tracking transitional probabilities between adjacent elements in language. The work is also especially important because failure to learn these types of non-adjacent regularities is a hallmark of many language disorders like Specific Language Impariment (SLI). The first aim of this research is to show how language learners might acquire knowledge about non- adjacent dependancies using knowledge of the language's hiearchical structure, and to see if this structure is learnable by an enriched form of statistical learning. We hypothesize that learners will be able to discover probability-dependant ""chunks"" in language, and use these chunks to transform non-adjacent relationships into adjacent relationships. This aim will be addressed by behavioral experiments with infants and adults. The second aim is to see if people find it easier to learn non-adjacent dependancies in language when those dependancies can be tied to language-external semantic cues. For example, a verb (or a verb phrase) and a direct object (or its noun phrase) might be tightly coupled linguisticly, even if they are separated by embedded clauses in particular sentences. It may be that the way learners acquire this linguistic regularity is by keeping track of the semantic or conceptual association between the verb's and direct object's real world referents. We hypothesize that in conditions where there is semantic relatedness between nonadacent elements in language, this will faciliate learning of the linguistic non-adjacent regularity. This aim will be addressed by a behavioral experiment with children and by a computational model designed to explore how the interaciton of semantic and linguistic knowledge facilliates learning. In summary, proposed research will address a critical question about how people learn the structure of language, address a key shortcoming of one current theory of language acquistion, and have important implications for language disorders like SLI.             n/a",Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties,7678067,F31DC009936,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Body of uterus', 'Child', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Infant', 'Information Distribution', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Morphology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'instrument', 'lexical', 'model design', 'phonology', 'phrases', 'research study', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'theories']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2009,28830,0.16101462016516901
"Auditory constraints on infant language learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the current research is to investigate auditory constraints on general learning mechanisms (GLMs) underlying infant language acquisition. There have been numerous demonstrations of the importance of GLMs in word segmentation, and more recently this approach has been extended to phoneme acquisition. The primary critique of GLMs is that they are too computationally powerful. Without constraints, it would be difficult to extract only meaningful regularities, making the task of language acquisition a potentially intractable problem. Auditory constraints may provide a good framework on which GLMs can operate, facilitating the task of language acquisition. The first Specific Aim of the research proposed in this application is to examine the relationships between auditory sensitivities and distributional learning during phoneme acquisition. 7.5-month-old infants will be exposed to either a unimodal or a bimodal distribution of speech sounds. A habituation procedure will be used to test the hypothesis that the presence of a region of increased auditory sensitivity at a category boundary will facilitate phoneme acquisition. The second Specific Aim is to investigate the relationship between rhythmic grouping biases and statistical learning during word segmentation from fluent speech. Following familiarization to an artificial language that contains both statistical and rhythmic cues to words boundaries, 6.5- and 8.5-month-old infants are expected to mis-segment the statistical words in the language if the statistics and the perceived rhythmic grouping are inconsistent. Age effects are expected only if linguistic experience is necessary for auditory rhythmic grouping biases to emerge. The third Specific Aim is to assess the domain generality of the mechanisms described in the first and second aims. Non-speech stimuli will be used to assess the generality of distributional and statistical learning in the same types of category learning and segmentation tasks. The goal of this research is to understand how the auditory system of a typically developing infant structures language learning. In some atypical populations, it is unclear whether language acquisition is delayed because the auditory system is compromised or because the mechanisms responsible for learning are compromised. Future studies will use these tasks to assess learning in atypical language learners (e.g., young children with phonological disorders, toddlers with cochlear implants, infants at risk for language impairments), with the eventual goal of developing new interventions for use in clinical populations.           n/a",Auditory constraints on infant language learning,7600444,F32HD055703,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Critiques', 'Cues', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human Characteristics', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Pattern', 'Phonetics', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'age effect', 'experience', 'natural language', 'phonology', 'programs', 'research study', 'sound', 'statistics', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2009,22393,0.13805740977344166
"Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental task in sentence comprehension involves assigning semantic roles to sentence constituents, determining who does what to whom. Verb knowledge plays a central role in this task. The verb determines what constituents can appear in the sentence, and what participant roles they will convey. In learning a new verb, a child must determine what relationship among participants the verb refers to, without the set of semantic instructions provided by the verb. The syntactic bootstrapping theory proposes that children use precursors of the adult's knowledge of syntax to understand sentences and therefore to learn verbs. This view is supported by evidence that children as young as 2 assign different meanings to verbs presented in different sentence structures. The proposed research asks what syntactic cues are helpful early in acquisition, before many of the complexities of syntax acquisition have been conquered. First, we argue that children treat the number of nouns in the sentence as a cue to its semantic predicate- argument structure. The number of nouns in the sentence is useful because it provides a probabilistic indicator of the verb's number of arguments. Second, early syntactic bootstrapping requires that children represent language experience in an abstract mental vocabulary that permits rapid generalization of syntactic learning to new verbs. Thus, we argue that language-specific grammatical learning, such as detecting the significance of word order in English, should transfer quickly to sentences containing new verbs, permitting progressively finer constraint on sentence interpretation and verb learning. This project explores how syntactic bootstrapping begins, and how it interacts with early progress in syntax acquisition. We take two complementary approaches: (1) Experiments with infants and toddlers will investigate the detection and use of the proposed simple structural cues to sentence interpretation and verb learning. (2) Computational experiments using a system for automatic semantic role labeling will test the main claims of our account using a substantial sample of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies is intended to advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and to guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing. The proposed research will help us to understand how infants and toddlers learn the words and syntax of their native languages; such research will contribute to the detection and remediation of language delays, and to language pedagogy.           n/a",Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension,7561736,R01HD054448,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Body of uterus', 'Child', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Event', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hearing', 'Heart', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Linguistics', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Agents', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computer studies', 'experience', 'feeding', 'lens', 'lexical', 'novel', 'programs', 'remediation', 'research study', 'success', 'syntax', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2009,235962,0.09529690344850664
"Tools for Automated Assessment of Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Language and communication problems critically characterize a number of neurodevelopmental disorders including Developmental Language Disorders (DLD) and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). It is increasingly recognized that assessment should include spontaneous natural language samples. There are measures, such as the Index of Productive Syntax (IPSyn), which are laborious to apply, since they require manual analysis of a corpus of sentences collected from the child. There is therefore a strong need for automated tools to aid clinicians in this task, and to provide more robust analyses for assessment. Many widely-used commercial software packages, such as the Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts (SALT) do little more than count linguistic features, and still require someone to code those features. Fully automated systems, such as Computerized Profiling (CP) do exist, but reports vary on how well they work. However, recent advances in natural language processing, in particular in the realm of grammar adaptation, mean that we are now able to produce high-quality commercial software that can be used by clinical practitioners in their assessment of child language. This project will build a commercially viable suite of fully automated, software-based tools, requiring no special equipment beyond a standard personal computer, targeted at clinicians who work with children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The system will have been evaluated not only with children with Typical Development (TD), but with data from children with ASD and DLD. The system will include the following components: (1) text normalization tools to help with the clean up and normalization of transcriptions; (2) a state -of-the-art part-of-speech tagger; (3) a state-of-the-art morphological analyzer; (4) a state-of-the-art syntactic parser; (5) a dependency analyzer and semantic-role labeler, (6) a scoring module to take the output of the language analysis, and map this to the IPSyn or other scales. The software will be written in C++ and Java, and will adopt a rigorous industrial coding style, namely the Google style guide, which is in the public domain. As part of an NIH-funded project on Autism, the Center for Spoken Language Understanding, in collaboration with colleagues at Yale University, has collected a corpus of video and audio recorded interactions of children with ASD and DLD, as well as TD children ages 4-8. In this STTR-funded project, we will perform a manual IPSyn assessment on these data and provide the results as a benchmark on how well the system will perform in the field. While the target language for the initial development will be English, the software will be written in a fully language-independent fashion, in that no properties of English will be hard-coded into the system. All that would be required to 'port' the system to a new language would be appropriate training material for the language.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language and communication problems critically characterize a number of neurodevelopmental disorders, and it is increasingly recognized that assessment should involve the analysis of spontaneous language samples.

"Social and Statistical Mechanisms of Prelinguistic Vocal Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How do infants learn to produce the sounds of their language? The vocal abilities of infants change dramatically over the first year of life. Beginning with the earliest, immature vocalizations, infants make rapid progress, typically producing their first words by 12 months of age. Along the way, they begin to produce speech-like syllables and to structure sequences of syllables in accordance with the phonological rules of their language environment. While the vocal achievements of the first year are well-described, not nearly as much is known about the mechanisms of change that drive vocal development. Most work focuses on the maturation of the vocal tract, but studies of vocal development in songbirds found that there are also social sources of developmental change. For example, young male cowbirds (Molothrus ater) rely on the reactions of females to shape their immature sounds into functional song. Based on the avian work, the investigators' preliminary studies have shown that infants can learn new patterns of vocalizing from caregivers' reactions to their babbling. How do infants use social feedback to create new, more developmentally advanced, vocalizations? The goal of the proposed research is to understand the mechanisms by which infants incorporate the phonological patterns of their language into their vocal repertoires. Based on preliminary studies, the investigators hypothesize that the contingent responses of caregivers to babbling facilitate infants' statistical learning of the phonological patterns of their language. To investigate this hypothesis, the variability and temporal contingency of speech to 9-month-old infants will be manipulated to assess their effects on vocal learning. The proposed research has important implications for educating parents in providing optimal learning environments for their infants. An understanding of the role of socially guided learning in speech and language could be used to help parents to be more sensitive to their infants' behavior in ways that would facilitate development. Investigating social influences on phonological development can also contribute to the study of speech-language pathology and of processes underlying both successful and disordered communicative development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By illuminating mechanisms by which infants learn to produce the sounds of their language from caregivers' contingent speech, the findings could inform interventions for disordered language development. The results could also be used to help parents and child care providers create social environments that foster and support language growth. Eventually, this research could be used to design preventive programs for infants with a higher risk of language delay (e.g., children with Down Syndrome or SLI).           Project Relevance By illuminating mechanisms by which infants learn to produce the sounds of their language from caregivers' contingent speech, the findings could inform interventions for disordered language development.

"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively. Understanding those mechanisms and how they might go wrong or be bolstered are surely fundamental to understanding the origins of developmental language disorders that delay or alter early lexical learning. Implementing procedures to benefit children with developmental disorders typically involves altering or highlighting aspects of the learning environment. This requires a principled understanding of the structure and regularities of that environment and processes of statistical learning.           n/a","Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints",7635904,R01HD056029,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ear', 'Empirical Research', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Play', 'Poaceae', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'data mining', 'developmental disease', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'fenson', 'haptics', 'insight', 'interest', 'lexical', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'programs', 'research study', 'simulation', 'social', 'statistics']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2009,186028,0.05535071099110036
"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies of infants, children, and adults will document the key structural variables in language learning that enable a distributional mechanism of category formation to operate and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and domain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the categories (noun, verb, etc) are formed from listening to the patterns of words in a small set of sentences. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal children can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies of infants, children, and adults will document the key structural variables in language learning that enable a distributional mechanism of category formation to operate and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and domain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the categories (noun, verb, etc) are formed from listening to the patterns of words in a small set of sentences.

"When cues converge: multiple regularities in language acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research project is to employ behavioral and computational methods to better understand how infants use multiple regularities when learning language. Many researchers have posited that infants use statistical learning mechanisms to extract these regularities. However, the majority of this work focuses on infants' abilities to exploit a single regularity. In their natural environment, infants receive input that contains many overlapping regularities of varying consistency. Little research has focused on how infants process this type of input. In order to make use of the cues available in natural input, infants must be able to exploit these overlapping probabilistic regularities. The first aim of this grant is to explore how infants use multiple regularities to find words in fluent speech. By 9 months, infants are able to robustly use both lexical stress and sequential statistics to segment words. However, prior research has focused on how infants use these regularities in isolation, or how weighting of the cues changes developmentally. We hypothesize that infants can use these cues for word segmentation when they are probabilistic and overlapping, as they are in natural languages such as English. The second aim is to investigate the effect of multiple regularities on word learning. As a child's vocabulary grows, regularities arise among the labels and referents they know, as well as within the mappings between labels and referents. These regularities may affect the acquisition of new words. However, their potential role in subsequent word learning has not been carefully explored. Using computational models, we can examine these issues by carefully controlling regularities that exist within a vocabulary and by exploring how different types of regularities may affect word learning. These models can lead to a deeper understanding of these processing mechanisms and to novel predictions, which can then be tested in behavioral experiments.    Public Health Interests:  The goal of this research is to better understand how typically developing infants learn language - in particular, how they use the many patterns that exist in natural languages to do so. The ability to make use of multiple regularities likely affects infants' skills at language learning. By better understanding how this process unfolds in typically developing infants, researchers will be able to investigate how children with language delays and disabilities may differ in their ability to integrate multiple cues.

"The Role of Statistical Learning in Acquiring Syntactic Categories    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed experiments will investigate the role of statistical learning in the acquisition of syntactic categories such as ""noun"" and ""verb"". The role of syntactic category knowledge in language acquisition is pervasive; for example, category knowledge both facilitates learning grammatical patterns and facilitates early word learning. While many aspects of language acquisition rely on syntactic category knowledge, the process by which these categories are learned is unclear. The goal of the proposed research is to test the hypothesis that statistical learning plays a role in acquiring syntactic categories. Words from different syntactic categories are distinguishable by statistical cues, such as their distributional properties (i.e., cooccurrence with other words), and their phonological properties (i.e., their sound structure), the first specific aim is to assess infants' sensitivity to these cues in the acquisition of noun and verb categories. If words' statistical properties are used in category learning, infants should be able to use these properties to identify novel category members in the early stages of category acquisition. Moreover, infants' ability to determine the category of novel words should reflect the degree to which they conform to the predominant statistical characteristics of the category, and training on these statistical properties should facilitate their use at younger ages. Infants' ability to categorize novel words will be assessed by testing whether they are mapped to object or action referents. The second specific aim is to test infants' ability to integrate statistical and semantic information in category learning. Acquisition of syntactic categories encompasses learning about both statistical properties and semantic properties, and these cues are correlated in natural language. If infants can integrate these cues, correlations between them should facilitate learning. Infants will be familiarized with an artificial language containing novel categories, and the correlations between statistical and semantic cues will be manipulated. If infants can integrate these cues, they should be better able to detect commonalities in the meanings of words within a category, and to learn the grammatical structures in which these words can occur, when cues are correlated than when they are not. Future studies will test children with Specific Language Impairment and other developmental language disorders (e.g., late talkers), who exhibit impaired word learning abilities and reduced sensitivity to distributional cues identifying syntactic categories. Testing children on these tasks will address the extent to which impaired statistical learning is a contributing factor in these disorders.          n/a",The Role of Statistical Learning in Acquiring Syntactic Categories,7408311,F32HD057698,"['Address', 'Age', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'member', 'novel', 'phonology', 'research study', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2008,46826,0.12776375251825087
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acquiring a language is among the most daunting feats uniformly accomplished by our species. Explorations of the language learning process present the opportunity to address central issues pertaining to human cognition and its development. The proposed research represents one approach to this topic: the study of the architecture of the learning processes underlying language acquisition, using laboratory learning experiments performed with adult, child, and infant participants. The goal of this research program is to substantially increase our knowledge of the statistical learning mechanisms that detect linguistic units by tracking the patterns of sounds, words, and other units in the input. Recent results suggest that statistical learning processes play an important role in the acquisition of language. However, little is currently known about the types of statistical regularities computed by learners and the constraints on learning that support successful knowledge acquisition. The proposed experiments will ask: (1) How does the structure of the input constrain statistical learning? Studies will consider perceptual, linguistic, and informational constraints on the choice of cues as input to learning. (2) How does prior experience influence statistical learning? Manipulations of prior experience, inside and outside the lab, will be used to assess effects on subsequent learning. (3) Can statistical learning account for basic phenomena in language acquisition? Interactions between statistical learning and other types of processes, such as rule learning and the presence of other cues in the input, will be investigated. All of these issues will be addressed using previously developed laboratory learning paradigms that permit careful manipulation of input and detailed assessment of what participants are able to learn. Studies using linguistic materials will be contrasted with studies using nonlinguistic materials to further explore the locus and domain-specificity of the learning mechanisms under consideration. The answers to these questions will inform an emerging theoretical framework, constrained statistical learning, intended to elucidate the study of language acquisition and other pressing issues in human learning and development. n/a",Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition,7336359,R01HD037466,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Research', 'Role', 'Solutions', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'analog', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'programs', 'research study', 'sound', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2008,270051,0.1239254729614492
"Constraints on Learning from Inconsistent Input All human learners with normal cognitive capacities who are exposed to language input in childhood  manage to acquire a language that looks very much like their input. However, at present we have little  idea how, exactly, learners accomplish this feat. We have little understanding of the nature of the learning  mechanisms that underlie and support language learning. This is the focus of the research in this  proposal. Three general questions guide the research.(1) What are the constraints on language learning  mechanisms? (2) Are the learning mechanisms involved in language acquisition specific to language or  are they of a more general nature? (3) Do these mechanisms change over time as learners age, and if  'so, how? The proposed research examines these questions by investigating the learning of probabilistic  and inconsistent patterns in the input using miniature artificial languages. This provides a rather unique  view of the constraints on learning mechanisms, examining the limits of what can and cannot be learned.  Previous work has shown that learners can acquire probabilistic patterns, however they sometimes  impose consistency on variation. Moreover, children are more likely to change such patterns than are  adults. The present research expands on the earlier results, asking about the nature of the interaction  between learners and input. Series 1 asks about the nature of the input that makes some inconstancy  learnable and some not. The studies examine the limits of veridical learning of inconsistent patterns in  languages, asking questions about the specificity of computations learners can perform, the  representations over which such computations can be performed, and the effect of prior domain-specific  knowledge. Series 2 asks about the nature of the learner, asking why learners regularize over  inconsistency at all.In particular, the studies examine whether working memory constraints, rather than  constraints stemming directly from the learning mechanisms themselves, are an important factor  influencing whether learners acquire the variation or instead impose regularity. Both series will be  conducted with adults and children to examine how learning changes over development. Although the  input in the proposed studies is somewhat atypical, the results from these studies will contribute to our  understanding of the learning mechanisms involved in language acquisition more generally, and  ultimately, this increases our understanding of both normal and disordered acquisition. n/a",Constraints on Learning from Inconsistent Input,7390362,R01HD048572,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer information processing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age related', 'design', 'programs', 'research study', 'stem']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2008,180295,0.0796314026815956
"Auditory constraints on infant language learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the current research is to investigate auditory constraints on general learning mechanisms (GLMs) underlying infant language acquisition. There have been numerous demonstrations of the importance of GLMs in word segmentation, and more recently this approach has been extended to phoneme acquisition. The primary critique of GLMs is that they are too computationally powerful. Without constraints, it would be difficult to extract only meaningful regularities, making the task of language acquisition a potentially intractable problem. Auditory constraints may provide a good framework on which GLMs can operate, facilitating the task of language acquisition. The first Specific Aim of the research proposed in this application is to examine the relationships between auditory sensitivities and distributional learning during phoneme acquisition. 7.5-month-old infants will be exposed to either a unimodal or a bimodal distribution of speech sounds. A habituation procedure will be used to test the hypothesis that the presence of a region of increased auditory sensitivity at a category boundary will facilitate phoneme acquisition. The second Specific Aim is to investigate the relationship between rhythmic grouping biases and statistical learning during word segmentation from fluent speech. Following familiarization to an artificial language that contains both statistical and rhythmic cues to words boundaries, 6.5- and 8.5-month-old infants are expected to mis-segment the statistical words in the language if the statistics and the perceived rhythmic grouping are inconsistent. Age effects are expected only if linguistic experience is necessary for auditory rhythmic grouping biases to emerge. The third Specific Aim is to assess the domain generality of the mechanisms described in the first and second aims. Non-speech stimuli will be used to assess the generality of distributional and statistical learning in the same types of category learning and segmentation tasks. The goal of this research is to understand how the auditory system of a typically developing infant structures language learning. In some atypical populations, it is unclear whether language acquisition is delayed because the auditory system is compromised or because the mechanisms responsible for learning are compromised. Future studies will use these tasks to assess learning in atypical language learners (e.g., young children with phonological disorders, toddlers with cochlear implants, infants at risk for language impairments), with the eventual goal of developing new interventions for use in clinical populations.           n/a",Auditory constraints on infant language learning,7486009,F32HD055703,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Critiques', 'Cues', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human Characteristics', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Numbers', 'Pattern', 'Phonetics', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'age effect', 'experience', 'phonology', 'programs', 'research study', 'sound', 'statistics', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2008,49646,0.13805740977344166
"Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental task in sentence comprehension involves assigning semantic roles to sentence constituents, determining who does what to whom. Verb knowledge plays a central role in this task. The verb determines what constituents can appear in the sentence, and what participant roles they will convey. In learning a new verb, a child must determine what relationship among participants the verb refers to, without the set of semantic instructions provided by the verb. The syntactic bootstrapping theory proposes that children use precursors of the adult's knowledge of syntax to understand sentences and therefore to learn verbs. This view is supported by evidence that children as young as 2 assign different meanings to verbs presented in different sentence structures. The proposed research asks what syntactic cues are helpful early in acquisition, before many of the complexities of syntax acquisition have been conquered. First, we argue that children treat the number of nouns in the sentence as a cue to its semantic predicate- argument structure. The number of nouns in the sentence is useful because it provides a probabilistic indicator of the verb's number of arguments. Second, early syntactic bootstrapping requires that children represent language experience in an abstract mental vocabulary that permits rapid generalization of syntactic learning to new verbs. Thus, we argue that language-specific grammatical learning, such as detecting the significance of word order in English, should transfer quickly to sentences containing new verbs, permitting progressively finer constraint on sentence interpretation and verb learning. This project explores how syntactic bootstrapping begins, and how it interacts with early progress in syntax acquisition. We take two complementary approaches: (1) Experiments with infants and toddlers will investigate the detection and use of the proposed simple structural cues to sentence interpretation and verb learning. (2) Computational experiments using a system for automatic semantic role labeling will test the main claims of our account using a substantial sample of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies is intended to advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and to guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing. The proposed research will help us to understand how infants and toddlers learn the words and syntax of their native languages; such research will contribute to the detection and remediation of language delays, and to language pedagogy.           n/a",Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension,7386787,R01HD054448,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Body of uterus', 'Child', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Event', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hearing', 'Heart', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Linguistics', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Participant', 'Patient Agents', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computer studies', 'experience', 'feeding', 'lens', 'lexical', 'novel', 'programs', 'remediation', 'research study', 'success', 'syntax', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2008,239691,0.09529690344850664
"Linking Language Comprehension to Production Patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project tests specific hypotheses about dependencies between language comprehension and production, which are typically studied independently. The PI's production-distribution-comprehension (PDC) account holds that utterance planning choices during language production yield distributional patterns in the language, in which certain syntactic structures co-vary with particular word choices, messages, and discourse environments. Comprehenders, through statistical learning during prior comprehension experiences, become highly sensitive to these patterns, and this sensitivity guides comprehension processes. Thus, many aspects of comprehension can ultimately be traced to task demands related to language production. Specific aims of the project include: (1) Link syntactic structure choice in production to mechanisms of sentence planning. (2) Compare the PDC account of comprehension to alternative views of relative clause interpretation. (3) Test the causal relations between production constraints, distributional patterns in the language, and comprehension performance. (4) Relate adult sentence comprehension to statistical learning. (5) Test the current limits of constraint-based models of language comprehension. The PDC approach offers a significant alternative to other views and also may inform language acquisition research by illuminating the role of distributional patterns in child language acquisition. The work also can inform language therapies for brain injured patients in several ways. First, sources of production difficulty are precisely investigated, as are accommodations that unimpaired speakers make in the face of this difficulty. Second, the project investigates the relationship between prior experience with a syntactic construction and comprehension difficulty, which can have implications for the amount and nature of practice that should be provided to patients to improve their comprehension of certain sentence types.         n/a",Linking Language Comprehension to Production Patterns,7426941,R01HD047425,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Characteristics', 'Child Language', 'Collaborations', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Depth', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Foxes', 'Human Characteristics', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Therapy', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Reading', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Work', 'base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'infancy', 'injured', 'insight', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'preference', 'research study', 'statistics', 'stem', 'syntax', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2008,164747,0.09974752206081847
"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively. Understanding those mechanisms and how they might go wrong or be bolstered are surely fundamental to understanding the origins of developmental language disorders that delay or alter early lexical learning. Implementing procedures to benefit children with developmental disorders typically involves altering or highlighting aspects of the learning environment. This requires a principled understanding of the structure and regularities of that environment and processes of statistical learning.           n/a","Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints",7490715,R01HD056029,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ear', 'Empirical Research', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Play', 'Poaceae', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Study', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'data mining', 'developmental disease', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'fenson', 'haptics', 'insight', 'interest', 'lexical', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'programs', 'research study', 'simulation', 'social', 'statistics']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2008,186183,0.05535071099110036

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acquiring a language is among the most daunting feats uniformly accomplished by our species. Explorations of the language learning process present the opportunity to address central issues pertaining to human cognition and its development. The proposed research represents one approach to this topic: the study of the architecture of the learning processes underlying language acquisition, using laboratory learning experiments performed with adult, child, and infant participants. The goal of this research program is to substantially increase our knowledge of the statistical learning mechanisms that detect linguistic units by tracking the patterns of sounds, words, and other units in the input. Recent results suggest that statistical learning processes play an important role in the acquisition of language. However, little is currently known about the types of statistical regularities computed by learners and the constraints on learning that support successful knowledge acquisition. The proposed experiments will ask: (1) How does the structure of the input constrain statistical learning? Studies will consider perceptual, linguistic, and informational constraints on the choice of cues as input to learning. (2) How does prior experience influence statistical learning? Manipulations of prior experience, inside and outside the lab, will be used to assess effects on subsequent learning. (3) Can statistical learning account for basic phenomena in language acquisition? Interactions between statistical learning and other types of processes, such as rule learning and the presence of other cues in the input, will be investigated. All of these issues will be addressed using previously developed laboratory learning paradigms that permit careful manipulation of input and detailed assessment of what participants are able to learn. Studies using linguistic materials will be contrasted with studies using nonlinguistic materials to further explore the locus and domain-specificity of the learning mechanisms under consideration. The answers to these questions will inform an emerging theoretical framework, constrained statistical learning, intended to elucidate the study of language acquisition and other pressing issues in human learning and development. n/a",Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition,7144995,R01HD037466,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Research', 'Role', 'Solutions', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'analog', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'programs', 'research study', 'sound', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2007,275672,0.1239254729614492
"Constraints on Learning from Inconsistent Input    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All human learners with normal cognitive capacities who are exposed to language input in childhood manage to acquire a language that looks very much like their input. However, at present we have little idea how, exactly, learners accomplish this feat. We have little understanding of the nature of the learning mechanisms that underlie and support language learning. This is the focus of the research in this proposal. Three general questions guide the research. (1) What are the constraints on language learning mechanisms? (2) Are the learning mechanisms involved in language acquisition specific to language or are they of a more general nature? (3) Do these mechanisms change over time as learners age, and if 'so, how? The proposed research examines these questions by investigating the learning of probabilistic and inconsistent patterns in the input using miniature artificial languages. This provides a rather unique view of the constraints on learning mechanisms, examining the limits of what can and cannot be learned. Previous work has shown that learners can acquire probabilistic patterns, however they sometimes impose consistency on variation. Moreover, children are more likely to change such patterns than are adults. The present research expands on the earlier results, asking about the nature of the interaction between learners and input. Series 1 asks about the nature of the input that makes some inconstancy learnable and some not. The studies examine the limits of veridical learning of inconsistent patterns in languages, asking questions about the specificity of computations learners can perform, the representations over which such computations can be performed, and the effect of prior domain-specific knowledge. Series 2 asks about the nature of the learner, asking why learners regularize over inconsistency at all. In particular, the studies examine whether working memory constraints, rather than constraints stemming directly from the learning mechanisms themselves, are an important factor influencing whether learners acquire the variation or instead impose regularity. Both series will be conducted with adults and children to examine how learning changes over development. Although the input in the proposed studies is somewhat atypical, the results from these studies will contribute to our understanding of the learning mechanisms involved in language acquisition more generally, and ultimately, this increases our understanding of both normal and disordered acquisition.         n/a",Constraints on Learning from Inconsistent Input,7212176,R01HD048572,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer information processing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age related', 'design', 'programs', 'research study', 'stem']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2007,186741,0.07914764963757072
"Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental task in sentence comprehension involves assigning semantic roles to sentence constituents, determining who does what to whom. Verb knowledge plays a central role in this task. The verb determines what constituents can appear in the sentence, and what participant roles they will convey. In learning a new verb, a child must determine what relationship among participants the verb refers to, without the set of semantic instructions provided by the verb. The syntactic bootstrapping theory proposes that children use precursors of the adult's knowledge of syntax to understand sentences and therefore to learn verbs. This view is supported by evidence that children as young as 2 assign different meanings to verbs presented in different sentence structures. The proposed research asks what syntactic cues are helpful early in acquisition, before many of the complexities of syntax acquisition have been conquered. First, we argue that children treat the number of nouns in the sentence as a cue to its semantic predicate- argument structure. The number of nouns in the sentence is useful because it provides a probabilistic indicator of the verb's number of arguments. Second, early syntactic bootstrapping requires that children represent language experience in an abstract mental vocabulary that permits rapid generalization of syntactic learning to new verbs. Thus, we argue that language-specific grammatical learning, such as detecting the significance of word order in English, should transfer quickly to sentences containing new verbs, permitting progressively finer constraint on sentence interpretation and verb learning. This project explores how syntactic bootstrapping begins, and how it interacts with early progress in syntax acquisition. We take two complementary approaches: (1) Experiments with infants and toddlers will investigate the detection and use of the proposed simple structural cues to sentence interpretation and verb learning. (2) Computational experiments using a system for automatic semantic role labeling will test the main claims of our account using a substantial sample of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies is intended to advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and to guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing. The proposed research will help us to understand how infants and toddlers learn the words and syntax of their native languages; such research will contribute to the detection and remediation of language delays, and to language pedagogy.           n/a",Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension,7176737,R01HD054448,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Body of uterus', 'Child', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Event', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hearing', 'Heart', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Linguistics', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Participant', 'Patient Agents', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computer studies', 'experience', 'feeding', 'lens', 'lexical', 'novel', 'programs', 'remediation', 'research study', 'success', 'syntax', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2007,241833,0.09529690344850664
"Linking Language Comprehension to Production Patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project tests specific hypotheses about dependencies between language comprehension and production, which are typically studied independently. The PI's production-distribution-comprehension (PDC) account holds that utterance planning choices during language production yield distributional patterns in the language, in which certain syntactic structures co-vary with particular word choices, messages, and discourse environments. Comprehenders, through statistical learning during prior comprehension experiences, become highly sensitive to these patterns, and this sensitivity guides comprehension processes. Thus, many aspects of comprehension can ultimately be traced to task demands related to language production. Specific aims of the project include: (1) Link syntactic structure choice in production to mechanisms of sentence planning. (2) Compare the PDC account of comprehension to alternative views of relative clause interpretation. (3) Test the causal relations between production constraints, distributional patterns in the language, and comprehension performance. (4) Relate adult sentence comprehension to statistical learning. (5) Test the current limits of constraint-based models of language comprehension. The PDC approach offers a significant alternative to other views and also may inform language acquisition research by illuminating the role of distributional patterns in child language acquisition. The work also can inform language therapies for brain injured patients in several ways. First, sources of production difficulty are precisely investigated, as are accommodations that unimpaired speakers make in the face of this difficulty. Second, the project investigates the relationship between prior experience with a syntactic construction and comprehension difficulty, which can have implications for the amount and nature of practice that should be provided to patients to improve their comprehension of certain sentence types.         n/a",Linking Language Comprehension to Production Patterns,7226029,R01HD047425,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Characteristics', 'Child Language', 'Collaborations', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dependency', 'Depth', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Foxes', 'Human Characteristics', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Therapy', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Reading', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Work', 'base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'infancy', 'injured', 'insight', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'preference', 'research study', 'statistics', 'stem', 'syntax', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2007,168217,0.09974752206081847
"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively. Understanding those mechanisms and how they might go wrong or be bolstered are surely fundamental to understanding the origins of developmental language disorders that delay or alter early lexical learning. Implementing procedures to benefit children with developmental disorders typically involves altering or highlighting aspects of the learning environment. This requires a principled understanding of the structure and regularities of that environment and processes of statistical learning.           n/a","Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints",7298428,R01HD056029,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ear', 'Empirical Research', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Play', 'Poaceae', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Study', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'data mining', 'developmental disease', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'fenson', 'haptics', 'insight', 'interest', 'lexical', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'programs', 'research study', 'simulation', 'social', 'statistics']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2007,217951,0.05535071099110036
"Analysis and Remediation of Language Production DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aphasia strikes approximately one in 250 Americans. The reduced ability to communicate with language represents, in most cases, a catastrophic loss of self-sufficiency and a source of profound social isolation. No treatment for aphasia reported to date has reliably brought about changes in language production that migrate from highly constrained laboratory tasks such as single picture description to more challenging and socially functional tasks such as the production of entire narratives. The current climate in health care limits access to speech therapy, and thus it is imperative to develop approaches to treatment which allow patients to supplement 1:1 clinical treatment with intensive independent home practice. We have developed two computer programs to address the need for effective aphasia treatments that can be used semi-independently. One is a communication system (CS), which allows aphasic users to record spoken sentences a single word or phrase at a time, to replay these words or phrases, and to build them into sentences and narratives by manipulating visual icons on a computer screen. The other program is a language therapy system (TS) incorporating speech recognition and natural language understanding technology, which allows the computer to 'understand' the patient's spoken sentence and to provide feedback about whether it correctly describes a picture on the screen. This allows independent home practice of spoken language. The goals of this project are: (1) to replicate pilot results showing measurably more structured language production by aphasic patients using the CS, and to link these effects to characteristics of subjects' language processing impairments (Exp. 1); (2) to assess the impact of enhancing the CS with word-finding support for more severely impaired patients (Exp. 2); (3) to replicate the positive outcomes in pilot studies which used the TS and CS to improve aphasic patients' spoken language production, and to use the TS to train subjects on grammatical structures that provide tests of specific hypotheses about the impact of impaired short term memory on aphasic production (Exp. 3); and (4) to use data automatically collected by the CS to investigate the nature of the underlying disruption and to motivate the most effective approaches to remediation (Exp. 4). Information obtained from these studies will provide a basis for the further development of novel, theoretically motivated approaches to aphasia treatment. n/a",Analysis and Remediation of Language Production,7188572,R01DC005629,"['Address', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Characteristics', 'Climate', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disruption', 'Elements', 'Employee Strikes', 'Evaluation', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Therapy', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social isolation', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Speech Therapy', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'analytical method', 'aphasic', 'base', 'computer program', 'improved', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'lexical retrieval', 'novel', 'phonology', 'programs', 'remediation', 'size', 'speech recognition', 'syntax', 'treatment effect']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2007,337888,0.0822867677477026

"Neural Network Models of Language DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is characterized by alterations of language and inferential processes. In spite of extensive research, core mechanisms of these disturbances remain uncertain. The overall objective of this RO1 proposal is to use DISCERN, a neural network simulation of natural language processing (Miikkulainen & Dyer 1991; Miikkulainen 1993, 1998), to investigate the mechanism(s) of language-based disturbances in schizophrenia. DISCERN learns stories, utilizes inferential processes, replies to questions, and produces coherent, multi-sentence narrative paraphrases of episodic memories. To enhance applicability of DISCERN as a model of human narrative language production, a larger corpus of stories will be learned that incorporates emotion-coding and self-reference. Simulations will be conducted to determine if disrupted function in different neural modules of DISCERN can produce three core language-based illness manifestations of schizophrenia -- (I) positive thought disorder (such as derailment and illogicality), (II) negative thought disorder (reduced language outputs), and (III) delusions of the idee fixe type. DISCERN will be used to compare and contrast effects of excessive noise versus reduced network connectivity when applied to semantic and working memory modules. Both types of ""lesions"" have been postulated to play an important role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Noise-induced lesions are predicted to produce word selection errors and curtail language output -- but not to produce positive thought disorder or delusions. In contrast, connectivity loss, when applied to story processing modules, is predicted to simulate all three disturbances, i.e., derailment and curtailment of language outputs as well as production of ""fixed"" narratives that simulate delusions. A parallel, pilot study of normal subjects and patients with schizophrenia will assess narrative recall of episodic memory. These behavioral data will be used to test and refine models of normal and schizophrenic language production. These findings will significantly advance our understanding of illness mechanisms in schizophrenia and direct future research aimed at developing more selective treatments that reverse these abnormalities. n/a",Neural Network Models of Language,6902613,R01MH066228,"['behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'computational neuroscience', 'human middle age (35-64)', 'human subject', 'language', 'neural information processing', 'neuropsychology', 'psychopathology', 'schizophrenia', 'short term memory', 'young adult human (21-34)']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,220725,0.10371377546623081

"Prosody and function words in early syntax acquisition  DESCRIPTION (provided by candidate):  Broadly, the proposed research will address how infants begin to take a linear string of words in the speech stream and build a hierarchically structured syntactic representation. This question is of importance for accounts of human language development and in the design of software for natural language processing. Both of these endeavors are of interest to those in the area of language deficits, either developmental or traumatic. Specifically, the project will examine the respective roles of function words and prosodic information in the early development of syntax in infants. The investigation will focus on the use of function words in other domains of language acquisition, the interaction between prosody and function words in infants' representation of sentences, and the development of functional syntactic categories. The approach will integrate behavioral and computational methods. Two measures of infant perceptual attention, the Headturn Preference Procedure, and the Intermodal Preferential Looking Paradigm will be used to assess infants' sensitivity to specific cues (prosody and the location of function words) to syntax in various contexts. This behavioral work will be supplemented with connectionist models to compare the relative benefits of different aspects of the speech input in developing syntactic knowledge.   n/a",Prosody and function words in early syntax acquisition,6782636,F32HD042927,"['artificial intelligence', 'auditory stimulus', 'behavior test', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'child (0-11)', 'clinical research', 'comprehension', 'computer simulation', 'cues', 'developmental neurobiology', 'human subject', 'language development', 'neural information processing', 'postdoctoral investigator', 'syntax', 'verbal learning', 'visual stimulus']",NICHD,BROWN UNIVERSITY,F32,2004,47296,0.07831490181209737
"Software Intervention for Advanced Syntax Development This proposal requests SBIR Phase II support to complete and field test language intervention software designed to promote syntactic development in school-age children (5-12 years old).  Language delays are pervasive among school-age children. What's more, two thirds of children identified as having language-specific impairments previously nor have received any form of language intervention during their preschool years. Consequently, there is a clear need to develop language intervention strategies designed specifically to meet the needs of this population; that is, intervention designed to promote development of the more advanced syntactic constructions typically missing from the grammar of these children. In Phase I, a curriculum was developed for introducing the syntax of interrogative operators. Curriculum design was guided by contemporary linguistic research, which suggests ways in which treatment may be improved and more successful outcomes achieved. Software was developed to deliver parts of this curriculum, and was integrated with an artificial intelligence component capable of generating individualized lessons based on emerging competencies. Twenty-six kindergartners used the software successfully during field- testing. In Phase II these efforts will be expanded by developing an integrated series of language intervention modules and verifying that the modules are effective under typical classroom conditions. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Speech-language pathologists, teachers and parents recognize the importance of intervention when a child's language status is impaired, and such intervention is mandated by Federal Law. As such, we anticipate that our computer-based language intervention system, designed to facilitate language development in school-age children, will be a commercial success and will fulfill an unmet need for individual services. n/a",Software Intervention for Advanced Syntax Development,6764134,R44DC004107,"['artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'educational resource design /development', 'elementary school', 'human subject', 'language development', 'language disorders', 'middle childhood (6-11)', 'psycholinguistics', 'speech disorders', 'syntax']",NIDCD,"LAUREATE LEARNING SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2004,34450,0.1030756632216374
"Early Language Intervention via the Internet    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests SBIR Phase II support to complete and field test an Internet-based language intervention system designed to promote language development in preschool children with language disorders. Language delays are pervasive among school-age children. Early intervention is crucial since the consequences of language delay can be serious and cumulative. Yet research shows that most children with language delays never receive language intervention services during their preschool years. We propose to complete an Internet-based early language intervention system designed specifically for the remediation of language disorders in 3-5 year old children with language function in the range of 24-42 months. The curricular design will be guided by contemporary linguistic research. Online delivery of the intervention curriculum will be individualized and controlled by an artificial intelligence system that tracks performance and adjusts instructional support. By combining easy access via the Internet with centralized data collection and curricular control, it will become possible to implement and easily manage coordinated school and home language intervention strategies, and to provide services to more children without further taxing limited professional resources. In Phase I we tested the feasibility and technical merit of this objective. A prototype program module was developed and tested with 23 students who were enrolled in an Early Essential Education program, including 19 preschoolers with language delays.

"Prosody and function words in early syntax acquisition  DESCRIPTION (provided by candidate):  Broadly, the proposed research will address how infants begin to take a linear string of words in the speech stream and build a hierarchically structured syntactic representation. This question is of importance for accounts of human language development and in the design of software for natural language processing. Both of these endeavors are of interest to those in the area of language deficits, either developmental or traumatic. Specifically, the project will examine the respective roles of function words and prosodic information in the early development of syntax in infants. The investigation will focus on the use of function words in other domains of language acquisition, the interaction between prosody and function words in infants' representation of sentences, and the development of functional syntactic categories. The approach will integrate behavioral and computational methods. Two measures of infant perceptual attention, the Headturn Preference Procedure, and the Intermodal Preferential Looking Paradigm will be used to assess infants' sensitivity to specific cues (prosody and the location of function words) to syntax in various contexts. This behavioral work will be supplemented with connectionist models to compare the relative benefits of different aspects of the speech input in developing syntactic knowledge.   n/a",Prosody and function words in early syntax acquisition,6647078,F32HD042927,"['artificial intelligence', ' auditory stimulus', ' behavior test', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' child (0-11)', ' clinical research', ' comprehension', ' computer simulation', ' cues', ' developmental neurobiology', ' human subject', ' language development', ' neural information processing', ' postdoctoral investigator', ' syntax', ' verbal learning', ' visual stimulus']",NICHD,BROWN UNIVERSITY,F32,2003,41608,0.07831490181209737
"Software Intervention for Advanced Syntax Development This proposal requests SBIR Phase II support to complete and field test language intervention software designed to promote syntactic development in school-age children (5-12 years old).  Language delays are pervasive among school-age children. What's more, two thirds of children identified as having language-specific impairments previously nor have received any form of language intervention during their preschool years. Consequently, there is a clear need to develop language intervention strategies designed specifically to meet the needs of this population; that is, intervention designed to promote development of the more advanced syntactic constructions typically missing from the grammar of these children. In Phase I, a curriculum was developed for introducing the syntax of interrogative operators. Curriculum design was guided by contemporary linguistic research, which suggests ways in which treatment may be improved and more successful outcomes achieved. Software was developed to deliver parts of this curriculum, and was integrated with an artificial intelligence component capable of generating individualized lessons based on emerging competencies. Twenty-six kindergartners used the software successfully during field- testing. In Phase II these efforts will be expanded by developing an integrated series of language intervention modules and verifying that the modules are effective under typical classroom conditions. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Speech-language pathologists, teachers and parents recognize the importance of intervention when a child's language status is impaired, and such intervention is mandated by Federal Law. As such, we anticipate that our computer-based language intervention system, designed to facilitate language development in school-age children, will be a commercial success and will fulfill an unmet need for individual services. n/a",Software Intervention for Advanced Syntax Development,6626058,R44DC004107,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' educational resource design /development', ' elementary school', ' human subject', ' language development', ' language disorders', ' middle childhood (6-11)', ' psycholinguistics', ' speech disorders', ' syntax']",NIDCD,"LAUREATE LEARNING SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2003,333838,0.1030756632216374
"Early Language Intervention via the Internet    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests SBIR Phase II support to complete and field test an Internet-based language intervention system designed to promote language development in preschool children with language disorders. Language delays are pervasive among school-age children. Early intervention is crucial since the consequences of language delay can be serious and cumulative. Yet research shows that most children with language delays never receive language intervention services during their preschool years. We propose to complete an Internet-based early language intervention system designed specifically for the remediation of language disorders in 3-5 year old children with language function in the range of 24-42 months. The curricular design will be guided by contemporary linguistic research. Online delivery of the intervention curriculum will be individualized and controlled by an artificial intelligence system that tracks performance and adjusts instructional support. By combining easy access via the Internet with centralized data collection and curricular control, it will become possible to implement and easily manage coordinated school and home language intervention strategies, and to provide services to more children without further taxing limited professional resources. In Phase I we tested the feasibility and technical merit of this objective. A prototype program module was developed and tested with 23 students who were enrolled in an Early Essential Education program, including 19 preschoolers with language delays. Data were collected over the Internet while testing six of these children. In Phase II we plan to fully develop and field-test this Internet-based language intervention system.         n/a",Early Language Intervention via the Internet,6644533,R44DC004487,"['Internet', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted instruction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' curriculum', ' data collection', ' education evaluation /planning', ' educational resource design /development', ' human subject', ' language development', ' language disorders', ' preschool child (1-5)', ' sociolinguistics', ' speech disorders', ' speech therapy', ' syntax']",NIDCD,"LAUREATE LEARNING SYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2003,819451,0.1163704498220212
"Referential Contrast Effects in Language Processing   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A great deal of work in sentence                processing over the years has dealt with the question of whether contextual          information can guide language processing. There is by now considerable              evidence that suggests that some kinds of information from the discourse             context have immediate effects. However, the question of how these effects           occur has remained largely ignored. The studies in this proposal focus on the        discourse properties of modified definite noun phrases. Work in sentence             processing has shown that the resolution of ambiguities in which one of the          possible readings involves noun modification is affected by the availability of      a discourse model in which the modificational phrase serves to distinguish           between two possible referents. A central question is whether such discourse         effects found with modifiers reflect a general, conventionalized property of         modification, or whether they are more aptly characterized as a more subtle          system based on expectations regarding typical usages. A series of studies is        proposed to investigate the hypothesis that a typical default expression exists      for neutral (i.e., non-contrastive) contexts, and that the use of a more             informative expression signals a contrastive function in the discourse, with         immediate processing consequences. Data will come from elicited production           tasks, on-line comprehension experiments which monitor subjects' eye movements       to a visual array in response to spoken linguistic stimuli, traditional reading      time studies, and prosodic analyses in a read-aloud task. The current proposal       represents a significant departure from existing work in two salient ways:           First, it attempts to provide a detailed investigation into the nature of the        referential effects, using a methodology that is especially well-suited for          studying referential aspects of language. Second, whereas previous findings          have been couched almost exclusively in terms of the mechanisms of sentence          processing, the current proposal seeks to integrate experiments from on-line         language processing and language production. Results of this project may be          useful in developing models for language disorders, for the development of           pedagogical tools, and for progress in artificial intelligence.                                                                                                           n/a",Referential Contrast Effects in Language Processing,6615572,R01MH062566,"['clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' eye movements', ' human subject', ' language', ' language development', ' neural information processing', ' phonology', ' reading', ' speech', ' syntax', ' visual stimulus', ' visual tracking']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2003,114544,0.0546105753188433
"Neural Network Models of Language DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is characterized by alterations of language and inferential processes. In spite of extensive research, core mechanisms of these disturbances remain uncertain. The overall objective of this RO1 proposal is to use DISCERN, a neural network simulation of natural language processing (Miikkulainen & Dyer 1991; Miikkulainen 1993, 1998), to investigate the mechanism(s) of language-based disturbances in schizophrenia. DISCERN learns stories, utilizes inferential processes, replies to questions, and produces coherent, multi-sentence narrative paraphrases of episodic memories. To enhance applicability of DISCERN as a model of human narrative language production, a larger corpus of stories will be learned that incorporates emotion-coding and self-reference. Simulations will be conducted to determine if disrupted function in different neural modules of DISCERN can produce three core language-based illness manifestations of schizophrenia -- (I) positive thought disorder (such as derailment and illogicality), (II) negative thought disorder (reduced language outputs), and (III) delusions of the idee fixe type. DISCERN will be used to compare and contrast effects of excessive noise versus reduced network connectivity when applied to semantic and working memory modules. Both types of ""lesions"" have been postulated to play an important role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Noise-induced lesions are predicted to produce word selection errors and curtail language output -- but not to produce positive thought disorder or delusions. In contrast, connectivity loss, when applied to story processing modules, is predicted to simulate all three disturbances, i.e., derailment and curtailment of language outputs as well as production of ""fixed"" narratives that simulate delusions. A parallel, pilot study of normal subjects and patients with schizophrenia will assess narrative recall of episodic memory. These behavioral data will be used to test and refine models of normal and schizophrenic language production. These findings will significantly advance our understanding of illness mechanisms in schizophrenia and direct future research aimed at developing more selective treatments that reverse these abnormalities. n/a",Neural Network Models of Language,6679518,R01MH066228,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' clinical research', ' computational neuroscience', ' human middle age (35-64)', ' human subject', ' language', ' neural information processing', ' neuropsychology', ' psychopathology', ' schizophrenia', ' short term memory', ' young adult human (21-34)']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2003,220725,0.10371377546623081

"Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence ABSTRACT  Approximately 15% of toddlers 18-36 months of age experience late language emergence (LLE; Paul, 1992; Singleton, 2018). These late talkers (LTs) have a reduced expressive vocabulary, but average non-linguistic abilities, in the absence of overt sensory or other developmental delays (Collisson, 2016; Paul & Jennings, 1992). Upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for language disorder (Rescorla, 2009), while others retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). LTs are at elevated risk for lifelong language and literacy impairments that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Singleton, 2018; Paul, 1993), and even subclinical outcomes have pervasive negative impacts (Rescorla, 2002). This project addresses questions crucial for the early diagnosis of LTs and prerequisite to the applicant’s long-term goal of establishing an independent research program on LLE, aimed ultimately at identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes to provide a foundation for more targeted interventions for LTs. This project complements prior work on LLE focused on language production by evaluating the time course of word learning and spoken word recognition in LTs and 2 control groups (age- and language-matched typically developing peers), all of whom will complete standardized assessments of cognitive -linguistic abilities. In Expt. 1, participants will train on a simple selection task using 4 novel and 4 familiar words that overlap phonologically (e.g., at onset, BUNNY-BUTTON, or offset, KITTEN-MITTEN). We will use eye tracking to estimate group and individual differences in lexical activation and competition over time. In Expt. 2, we will record EEG (electroencephalography) in a passive listening task. Participants will watch a silent video as newly-learned and familiar words from Expt. 1 are repeated. ERP (event-related potential) analyses will examine individual and group differences in responses to newly-learned vs. familiar words. We will also use machine-learning (support vector machines, SVMs) to decode EEG responses to specific words for each participant, on the logic that fidelity and coherence of responses will determine SVM classification success. Group and individual differences in eye tracking, ERP, and/or EEG-decoding measures will provide new insights into receptive abilities of LTs, and provide a basis for future work aimed at identifying LTs with greatest risk for clinical or subclinical language outcomes. The project will take place at the U. of Connecticut and Haskins Labs. The applicant and sponsors have developed a training plan for the applicant focused on further developing her (1) EEG and statistical skills, (2) knowledge base of the cognitive neuroscience of typical and atypical language development, (3) dissemination skills, and (4) understanding of principles for the responsible conduct of research, with the aim of supporting her goal to be an independent researcher in a Research-1 environment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Approximately 15% of toddlers meet criteria for being a late talker (LT) (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018;) and upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for spoken and/or written language disorder (Rescorla, 2009) while another subset will retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). Late language emergence (LLE) is associated with lifelong clinical and subclinical weaknesses in language and literacy that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018), and even subclinical outcomes have a negative impact on vocational and higher educational choices (Rescorla, 2002). The proposed research will address questions prerequisite to the applicant's long-term goal of establishing an independent research program aimed at (1) identifying early markers of chronic impact in order to optimally allocate scarce early intervention resources and (2) identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes which will provide the foundation for more focused and targeted forms of interventions for LTs with a range of clinical and subclinical language outcomes.",Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence,9975626,F31DC018220,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Control Groups', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Endowment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exclusion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Morphology', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'language impairment', 'language outcome', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'literacy', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'peer', 'phonology', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'skills', 'social', 'sound', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'trait', 'visual tracking', 'word learning']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,F31,2020,15602,0.10828564410730682
"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9825536,R01DC013996,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American Sign Language', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow up assessment', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'language comprehension', 'language disorder diagnosis', 'phonology', 'psychiatric symptom', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'school district', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'social communication', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,574747,0.1341935197792712
"Identifying the neural structures and dynamics that regulate phonological structure The systematic patterning of language is a fundamental property of cognition. One aspect of this patterning, constraints on the combination of speech sounds to form words (phonotactic structure), has been implicated in constraining diverse processes related to language acquisition, perception, and production, bilingual language use, memory and even influences non-linguistic processes including the memorability of novel words and consumer reaction to novel brand names. This patterning changes in a variety of common acquired and developmental communication disorders. We will explore two explanations for these effects. One, developed in linguistic theory, argues that language users discover a set of abstract, language-specific rules or constraints that shape language use. The other view, developed in connectionist and dynamic systems theory, argues that phonotactic constraints emerge from top-down lexical influences on speech perception. Discriminating between these approaches is difficult because both explain behavioral data well. It is essential to discriminate between these accounts for two reasons. This question offers an excellent opportunity to resolve the debate over whether abstract linguistic rules/constraints create or simply describe the patterning of language. The resolution of this question has fundamental implications for the way linguistic formalism and connectionist simulations relate to human processing. At a more immediate level, this research offers the opportunity to identify a common core mechanism (either the leveraged use of abstract linguistic rules or top-down lexical influences) that explains and unites diverse linguistic and cognitive phenomena. Past efforts to resolve these issues have failed because of fundamental inferential limitations of behavioral and BOLD imaging paradigms. Accordingly, we have developed new tools and research strategies that allow us to identify patterns of directed interaction between brain regions (effective connectivity), and use these analyses to draw much stronger inferences about the dynamic processes that shape cognition. Observers in the field have argued that our methods have already provided “definitive” evidence to resolve the decades old debate over the role of top- down processes in speech processing. This proposal would extend those methods, and introduce innovative neural decoding analyses that we will use to characterize the categories (e.g. rules, words, abstract phonological representations needed to support rule application) that are encoded in localized brain activity. Using these methods, we will determine whether top-down lexical processes that we have shown produce phonotactic phenomena related to the processing of patterns that occur in speaker's language generalize to unfamiliar patterns. We will also use them to identify the substrates of rule- versus word-mediated processing, to provide a baseline for interpreted the representations and dynamic processes that support phonotactic effects in natural language processing. The human ability to learn and use language is the result of a complex set of dynamic brain processes that can break down as the result of disease, injury or developmental disorders. This work uses new non-invasive techniques to observe and understand some of the most fundamental brain processes that shape language learning and use so that we may better understand how they break down. This understanding should one day guide the development of better ways to treat diverse language disorders.",Identifying the neural structures and dynamics that regulate phonological structure,9894782,R01DC015455,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algebra', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Common Core', 'Communication impairment', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Structure', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'bilingualism', 'developmental disease', 'dynamic system', 'experience', 'innovation', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'phonology', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'speech processing', 'theories', 'tool', 'word learning']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,517151,0.09863726767297115
"Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders Improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, progress in testing these treatments is limited by the lack of informative outcome measures to indicate whether or not an intervention or treatment is having the desired effect on a child's conversational use of language (i.e., discourse skills). The long-term goal of the proposed renewal project is to harness the benefits of NLP to impact functional spoken language outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal of the parent R01 (R01DC012033) is to develop and validate new Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods that automatically measure discourse-related skills, including language productivity (talkativeness), grammar and vocabulary, and discourse, based on raw (i.e., not coded or annotated) transcripts of natural language samples. Our objective in this proposal is to take the next step to evaluate the suitability of these NLP-based measures as outcomes for children with a range of intellectual abilities, language levels, and diagnoses. NLP algorithms require choices of pivotal parameter settings, such as word frequency dependent weights. While our previous results, involving between-group contrasts, were insensitive to these settings, our proposed project, involving psychometric quantities such as validity, may be sensitive to them. Building on our progress from the parent R01, we propose to pursue three specific aims: (1) Identify pivotal parameter settings that optimize stability of NLP discourse measures, and examine responsiveness to real change; (2) Evaluate consistency of NLP discourse measures, and identify key measurement factors that impact consistency; and (3) Evaluate validity of NLP discourse measures, and differences in validity as a function of diagnostic group, age, IQ, and language ability. Our approach will focus on optimizing stability of such measures, and assessing responsiveness to change over time, consistency across sampling contexts and different sample lengths, and validity of each measure. The contribution of the proposed project will be to systematically assess the psychometric properties of NLP discourse measures. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by taking the crucial next step: the development of scalable, psychometrically sound measures of discourse skills that can be used to assess between-group differences as well as within-individual change over time. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to result in viable spoken language outcome measures for children with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, making it possible to target and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions. Ultimately, the successful completion of this study will provide the immediate ability to scale up treatment evaluations involving measurement of spoken language use, allowing flexible data collection across sites and studies, and in the future provide new targets for to-be-developed behavioral and pharmacological interventions. The proposed research is relevant to public health because improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and outcome measures that are automated, quantitative, scalable, and objective are needed to evaluate these treatments. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of NIH because it contributes to the development of fundamental knowledge about the spoken language use among children with a range of neurodevelopment disorders and conversational language difficulties, and will make it possible to target spoken language and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions.",Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders,9895715,R01DC012033,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stereotyping', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'common treatment', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'indexing', 'informant', 'innovation', 'language outcome', 'natural language', 'neurodevelopment', 'parent project', 'scale up', 'skills', 'sound', 'symptomatic improvement', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,583798,0.09361323263878728
"Structural and functional connectivity markers of developmental speech and language disorders ABSTRACT Developmental speech and language disorders affect an estimated 15% of children and have lifelong impacts on social and emotional development and employment. Two common neurodevelopmental disorders are developmental language disorder (DLD; also called specific language impairment) and developmental stuttering, affecting 7% and 5% of children respectively. Despite their prevalence and immense impact, little is known of the neural causes, correlates, and consequences of these common neurodevelopmental disorders; thus, effective treatment remains elusive. In the proposed project, we will study the neural underpinnings of these disorders using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study structural and functional neural connectivity. Previous studies of connectivity in these populations are limited and show little consensus, likely due in part to small sample sizes. Theoretical accounts of both disorders implicate dysfunctional neural circuits through the basal ganglia. In the current proposal, we will test and compare the structural and functional integrity of neural pathways in large cohorts of people with DLD (N=80) and people who stutter (PWS; N=80) and compare them with similar data obtained in age- and sex-matched control groups of people with typical development (N=160). First, we will assess connectivity in speech/language-specific networks, using diffusion data to assess structural connectivity and resting-state data to assess functional connectivity. Results will indicate abnormalities in connectivity in large cohorts of PWS and people with DLD. In each disorder, we will also determine connectivity contributions to individual differences in behavior. This will reveal how different connectivity patterns are correlated to differences in severity along relevant dimensions (e.g., fluency, language measures), ideally resulting in neural correlates of the disorders. Finally, we will evaluate whole-brain functional connectivity differences between each disorder group and its matched control group using data-driven machine learning approaches. Results will indicate patterns of neural activity that differentiate these disorders from controls. The outcome of this proposal will be the characterization of underlying network differences in these populations, which will ideally lead to the development of targeted behavioral and neuro-modulatory treatments of these multifaceted and pervasive disorders. Research and training will take place at the University of Oxford, an ideal environment in which to pursue this line of research. The applicant will be mentored by world-leading researchers with the knowledge needed to guide him in this work, including expertise in the neural bases of developmental speech and language disorders, cutting-edge methodology in neuroimaging, and machine learning. Achieving these aims will illuminate the neural correlates of these speech and language disorders as well as prepare the applicant for an independent research career in this area. PROJECT NARRATIVE For a surprisingly large number of children, as many as 15%, speech and language development does not go smoothly and results in disorders such as stuttering or language delay. We wish to understand more about the causes of these common disorders and will assess whether the brain networks involved in speech and language development are impaired in people with developmental language disorder and stuttering.

"Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication Project Summary/Abstract: Processing acoustic communication signals is among the most difficult yet vital abilities of the auditory system. These abilities lie at the heart of language and speech processing, and their success or failure has profound impacts on quality of life across the lifespan. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms that support these basic abilities holds promise for advancing assistive listening devices, and for improving diagnoses and treatments for learning disabilities and communication disorders, such as auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, and specific language impairment. Non-invasive neuroscience techniques in humans reveal the loci of language-related processing but do not answer how individual neurons and neural circuits implement language-relevant computations. Thus, circuit-level neuro-computational mechanisms that support acoustic communication signal processing remain poorly understood. Multiple lines of research suggest that songbirds can provide an excellent model for investigating shared auditory processing abilities relevant to language. This proposal investigates neural mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing abilities shared between songbirds and humans. In Aim 1, we test the cellular-level predictions of a powerful modelling framework, called predictive coding, proposed as a general computational mechanism to support the learned recognition of complex temporally patterned signals at multiple timescales. We combine state-of-the-art machine learning methods with multi-electrode electrophysiology, to test explicit models for natural stimulus representation, prediction, and error coding in single cortical neurons and neural populations. One aspect of auditory perception integral to speech is the discretization of the signal into learned categorically perceived sounds (phonemes). In Aim 2, we use the predictive coding framework to investigate the learned categorical perception of natural auditory categories in populations of cortical neurons. In humans, the transition statistics between adjacent phonemes can aid or alter phoneme categorization, providing cues for language learners and listeners to disambiguate perceptually similar sounds. Aim2 also examines how categorical neural representations are affected by temporal context. In addition to which phonemes occur in a sequence, speech processing also requires knowing where those elements occur. Sensitivities to the statistical regularities of speech sequences are established long before infants learn to speak, and continue to affect both recognition and comprehension throughout adulthood. Songbirds also attend to the statistical regularities in their vocal communication signals. In Aim 3, we focus on how sequence-specific information is encoded by single neurons and neural populations in auditory cortex. The proposed approach permits progress in the near term towards establishing the basic neurobiological substrates of foundational language-relevant abilities and a general framework within which more complex, uniquely human processes, can be proposed and eventually tested. Project Narrative: Normal speech comprehension and communication are rooted in basic auditory cognitive processes. Deficits in these processes accompany severe communication disorders (e.g. auditory processing disorder, dyslexia, specific language impairment, autism), and their abnormal function can compound the negative impacts of hearing impairments. The proposed project investigates the neuronal mechanisms of auditory temporal pattern processing using natural communication signals, with the ultimate goal of understanding the neurobiological basis of language-relevant abilities and improving treatment of communication processing disorders.",Temporal Pattern Perception Mechanisms for Acoustic Communication,9939507,R01DC018055,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hearing Aids', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Songbirds', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Sturnus vulgaris', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'bird song', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'learned behavior', 'machine learning method', 'model development', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'pattern perception', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'specific language impairment', 'speech processing', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'success']",NIDCD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,334688,0.010301328433105954
"Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The annual Academy of Aphasia meeting is the premier conference for researchers in the field of language processing and aphasia. Since the first meeting in 1963, this international meeting has brought together an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, neurologists, and speech-language pathologists to discuss the latest research in the field of aphasia, including theoretical, clinical, and rehabilitation aspects of this language disorder. The topics at the conference range widely but almost always cover all aspects of language processing including phonological processing, lexical-semantic processing, syntactic processing, orthographic processing, bilingualism, computational modeling, non-invasive and invasive brain imaging, language recovery, neuroplasticity, and rehabilitation. In this proposal, we aim to include two special initiatives that will take place during the annual academy of aphasia conference. The first initiative involves a formal mentoring program for young investigators entering the field of aphasia research. In this program, selected student/post-doctoral fellows from interdisciplinary backgrounds who are first authors at the conference are paired with a mentor. This mentor will provide specific feedback about the fellow's presentation and general mentorship to the fellow about research and academic careers. This program is currently occurring as part of the conference and has been growing at the annual meeting with very positive feedback. Additionally, a formal mentoring meeting will allow a structured format for discussion about a career in aphasia research. The second initiative will be a three hour seminar (New Frontiers in Aphasia Research) that covers the background and approach of a state of the art methodology (e.g., fNIRS, graph theoretical metric, machine learning approaches) that has an application to the study of aphasia. These workshops will be recorded and, consequently, uploaded to the academy website/youtube channel for dissemination to aphasia researchers and the public. This workshop will allow conference attendees to understand the conceptual and methodological aspect of a particular scientific approach that can be implemented in their study of aphasia. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of aphasia research, these workshops will bridge the communication between aphasia researchers and scientists and experts who have developed new approaches to study the brain. This meeting already allows a valuable opportunity for cross-pollination of research ideas and will now provide a platform for the training the next generation of scientists interested in pursuing the nature of aphasia and associated language disorders in adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Approximately 100,000 individuals suffer from aphasia each year. The academy of aphasia is an organization of clinicians, scientists and practitioners who study this communication disorder and develop interventions to treat individuals with aphasia. The members comprise a very interdisciplinary group of linguists, psychologists, speech and language clinicians, neurologists and neuroscientists. The annual academy of aphasia meeting is the premier venue to share state of the art methodologies for application in the study of aphasia to improve the research in the development of diagnosis and treatment approaches to alleviate aphasia. This conference is also the ideal venue to educate and train the next generation of aphasia researchers who are well trained from a theoretical, technical and clinical standpoint and are committed to expand the impact of research in aphasia.",Academy of Aphasia Research and Training Symposium,9944489,R13DC017375,"['Academy', 'Adult', 'Aphasia', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Committee Membership', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Governing Board', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-aphasic', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speech Perception', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Travel', 'Videotape', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'career', 'career networking', 'experience', 'frontier', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'meetings', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'phonology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'semantic processing', 'success', 'symposium', 'syntax', 'tenure track', 'web site']",NIDCD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R13,2020,39939,0.05918370163335296
"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment (PLI) emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, identification in toddlers is not currently possible because of the high rate of false positives reflecting transient language delays. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, neurodevelopmental approach to generate earlier, more accurate identification of toddler risk for persistent PLI via: (a) multi-faceted, longitudinal assessment of toddler emergent language patterns; (b) detailed consideration of the transactional language environment; and (c) accounting for emergent health risk in predictive models. Earlier, reliable identification of toddlers at highest risk for PLI will optimize early intervention to prevent developmentally- cascading effects.",The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment,9875268,R01DC016273,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'model building', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'standard measure', 'translational approach', 'visual tracking']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,585545,0.13198555827704725
"Administrative Supplement to The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) PROJECT SUMMARY – Original Submission Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Although language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here 24-36 months) impedes accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model to identify PLI as early as possible. Our developmentally- sensitive, translational approach introduces multiple innovations including: (1) characterizing the developmental patterning of toddler emergent language beginning at 24 mos. using state-of-the-art methods, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language into PLI risk assessment; (3) using a novel paradigm to assess the protective effects of both behavioral and neural synchronization within parent-child language transactions; and (4) consideration of irritability, a robust developmental marker of early mental health risk, to enhance identification of those language delayed toddlers at highest risk for persistence. For the proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L), we capitalize on our funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non-irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24-month-olds. Our key predictors will be toddler emergent language patterns (24-36 months), their neural biomarkers and synchrony within the transactional language environment. Our central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age (54 mos., when PLI can be reliably evaluated), assessed via clinical gold standard expressive and receptive language abilities. SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1a. Evaluate accuracy of PLI prediction based on multi-component measures of language including intensive longitudinal assessments of toddler developmental precursors of key language functions at older ages, neural biomarkers. We will assess neural and linguistic processing via quantitative EEG during parent-child interaction and ERPs to speech sounds as well as during eye tracking tasks and 1b. Evaluate feasibility of creating an algorithm for early identification of PLI that can be applied in clinical practice, using cross-validation and machine learning. AIM 2: Test the hypothesis that parent-child dyadic synchrony buffers PLI risk For the first time, we combine behavioral and novel social EEG measures of parent-child synchrony during natural interaction and a custom-designed word learning task to directly test how observed (behavioral) and neural (EEG) dyadic synchrony impact word learning. AIM 3: Test whether consideration of toddler irritability enhances PLI prediction. In sum, PLI confers sustained negative effects on a variety of personal-social and academic outcomes. Pinpointing children at highest risk for PLI is critical for reducing the public health burden of PLI for children, families, and the systems supporting them, and enhancing targeted allocation of resources. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, many toddlers with early language delays recover naturally, and others who appear to be developing typically show signs of impairment by preschool age. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, multi-level neurodevelopmental approach to characterize emergent language patterns from 24- 36 mos. along with the influence of neural and linguistic processing and transactional processes within the child's broader language environment. We also test whether PLI prediction is enhanced via consideration of irritability, a robust predictor of early mental health risk. Drawing on findings from our predictive models, we will also examine feasibility of developing a clinical algorithm from this scientifically-validated toolkit. Generating reliable methods for accurate identification of young children at highest risk for language impairment lays the foundation for optimizing early intervention and preventing developmentally-cascading effects on academic and adaptive functioning.",Administrative Supplement to The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L),10162280,R01DC016273,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Language', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Human Subject Research', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institutes', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research Activity', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Speech Sound', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Transact', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'coronavirus disease', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'standard measure', 'stress reduction', 'translational approach', 'tv watching', 'visual tracking', 'word learning']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,197084,0.11672980995816012
"Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders Abstract Language delay and impairments are common in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), as are sensory (including auditory) anomalies. Since acquisition of spoken language relies on the integrity of the auditory system, language delay and impairments may be related to sound processing abnormalities that are frequently observed in children with ASDs (despite normal peripheral hearing). However, it is not understood if and how early auditory brain anomalies may developmentally contribute to impaired language development.  This project will examine the maturation of auditory and language systems in the brain across early childhood, during the critical period for language acquisition. We will employ a longitudinal design and multimodal neuroimaging, including high-resolution anatomical, diffusion, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with added frequent and extensive behavioral and neuropsychological assessments. Our central hypothesis is that early disruptions to cortical sound processing precede and predict language impairments in ASDs and may thus be considered causal contributors – a hypothesis that has been frequently considered in the literature, but never tested at the neural level.  Our aims are to thoroughly characterize the structural integrity and functional differentiation of the cortical auditory and language systems (Aim 1) and their maturational trajectories (Aim 2) in toddlers with ASDs and age-matched typically developing peers. This will allow us to establish whether neural abnormalities in cortical processing of complex sounds in toddlers are predictive of language development and social behavior at the pre-school age (Aim 3). The rationale and translational significance of this project are that identification of alterations in brain development linked to language delay and impairment in the first years of life will allow for more targeted interventions in the auditory domain at a time when they are most effective. Project narrative The project aims to find causes of language impairment in children with autism spectrum disorders by studying the brain organization of the auditory system in toddlers at the very earliest age of provisional diagnosis. The overarching hypothesis is that atypical auditory processing contributes to language delay and impairment. Pinpointing auditory causes of language problems in children with ASDs may inform early interventions.",Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders,9913498,R01DC017736,"['Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Anisotropy', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early Intervention', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hearing', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Morphology', 'Neurites', 'Neuropsychology', 'Nursery Schools', 'Organizational Change', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Radial', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sensory', 'Sleep', 'Social Behavior', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TEP1 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'auditory processing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'critical period', 'density', 'early childhood', 'gray matter', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'molecular modeling', 'multimodality', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'peer', 'phonology', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sound', 'theories', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,592142,0.12099833340753743
